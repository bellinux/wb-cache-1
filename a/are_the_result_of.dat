5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic {{changes in a}} population <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem}} to fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> male-female twin combinations).|$|E

5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar.

25|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and {{these have been}} designated by researchers as clades A-D. Other studies that included a wider sample of specimens have reported two rare East Asian clades E-F with weaker statistical support. In 2009, a study found that haplogroups A, B and C included 98% of dogs and are found universally distributed across Eurasia, indicating that they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a single domestication event, and that haplogroups D, E, and F were rare and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> regional hybridization with local wolves post-domestication. Haplogroups A and B contained subclades that appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> hybridization with wolves post-domestication, because each haplotype within each <b>of</b> these subclades <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a female wolf/male dog pairing.|$|R
