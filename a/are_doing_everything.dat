2500|$|After the United States Federal Aviation Administration {{downgraded}} Israel's {{aviation safety}} rating to 2 in February 2009, an IATA member has warned El Al, {{as well as}} competing airlines Arkia and Israir, that they may appear on the European blacklist of banned carriers.

The Europeans' e-mail is strange. We <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> we can to improve security." [...] The European Union has yet to make an official statement on the matter. El Al uses the Amadeus CRS system for reservation, inventory, check-in and online bookings. In November 2012, the United States FAA restored Israel's category 1 rating.|$|E

We were told we should not make our running expenses. To-day we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> that the State industry at tempted, and are making it pay. We have put the trawling industry firmly on its feet. We started off with no better equipment than the State, and with handicaps Imposed on us by the State., But throughout we had the advantages of business administration and of cleanliness. As for the profits to be made, take our own case. Our profits have long since repaid us the cost of our trawler. We have Just floated ourselves into a company, with a capital of £20,000. We are looking round now in Scotland for a second trawler. We have only begun to show the possibilities of the industry. There are further big developments to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 3 October 2008, seven Russian {{soldiers}} were killed and another seven wounded by a car bomb that exploded near the Russian military base. Among them was Colonel Ivan Petrik, the peacekeeper's Chief of Staff. The Russians accused the Georgians of orchestrating the [...] "terrorist attack", claiming that just before the blast, the Russians arrested two cars, four Georgians and seized light firearms and two grenades. [...] "The cars and the detained people were escorted to Tskhinvali. During the search {{of one of the}} cars, an explosive device equivalent to some 20kg of TNT went off," [...] a military spokesman told Interfax. The South Ossetian leader accused Georgia of [...] "state terrorism". [...] "The latest terrorist attacks in South Ossetia prove that Georgia has not renounced its policy of state terrorism," [...] he said. [...] "We have no doubt that these terrorist acts are the work of Georgia special forces." [...] The Georgian government blamed Russia for the incident. [...] "If provocations and tensions are in the interest of anyone, it's the Russians," [...] the Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili told the Reuters news agency, [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> not to pull troops out within the set term". Georgia also said it would have had to find Ossetians to take the car into the Russian-controlled area. [...] "I don't understand the logic. How could the Georgian secret service plan that the Ossetians would steal the car and that the Russians would take it to their base. Are we geniuses or what?" [...] Utiashvili said. The French Presidency of the European Union condemned the attack.|$|E
2500|$|... – In a {{press release}} from his office, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{condemned}} the attacks in saying: [...] "I think I speak {{for the whole world}} – shock and outrage at the tragic destruction of innocent lives. I have already sent my sympathy and support to Prime Minister Singh of India and to say we will {{do everything we can to}} help the Indian government. Our first duty is towards British citizens caught up in this terror in Mumbai. The High Commissioner has come from Delhi to visit all those who are injured – he's visiting them now. It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that during the course of the day – what I can assure you is we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it and talk to them – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time". Foreign Secretary David Miliband also condemned the attacks, characterising them as [...] "an attack on all of us, not just India".|$|E
60|$|For my part, after {{weighing}} {{this theory}} carefully, and after admitting {{the whole of}} its indictment of bourgeois capitalism, I find myself definitely and strongly opposed to it. The Third International is an organization which exists to promote the class-war and to hasten the advent of revolution everywhere. My objection is not that capitalism is less bad than the Bolsheviks believe, but that Socialism is less good, not in its best form, but in the only form {{which is likely to}} be brought about by war. The evils of war, especially of civil war, are certain and very great; the gains to be achieved by victory are problematical. In the course of a desperate struggle, the heritage of civilization is likely to be lost, while hatred, suspicion, and cruelty become normal in the relations of human beings. In order to succeed in war, a concentration of power is necessary, and from concentration of power the very same evils flow as from the capitalist concentration of wealth. For these reasons chiefly, I cannot support any movement which aims at world revolution. The damage to civilization done by revolution in one country may be repaired by the influence of another in which there has been no revolution; but in a universal cataclysm civilization might go under for a thousand years. But while I cannot advocate world revolution, I cannot escape from the conclusion that the Governments of the leading capitalist countries <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> to bring it about. Abuse of our power against Germany, Russia, and India (to say nothing of any other countries) may well bring about our downfall, and produce those very evils which the enemies of Bolshevism most dread.|$|E

6000|$|It seems {{therefore}} that we {{must begin}} by holding the right to an income as sacred and equal, just as we now begin by holding {{the right to life}} as sacred and equal. Indeed the one right is only a restatement of the other. To hang me for cutting a dock laborer's throat after making much of me for leaving him to starve when I do not happen to have a ship for him to unload is idiotic; for as he does far less mischief with his throat cut than when he is starving, a rational society would esteem the cutthroat more highly than the capitalist. The thing has become so obvious, and the evil so unendurable, that if our attempt at civilization is not to perish like all the previous ones, we shall have to organize our society {{in such a way as}} to be able to say to every person in the land, [...] "Take no thought, saying What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" [...] We shall then no longer have a race of men whose hearts are in their pockets and safes and at their bankers. As Jesus said, where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. That was why he recommended that money should cease to be a treasure, and that we should take steps to make ourselves utterly reckless of it, setting our minds free for higher uses. In other words, that we should all be gentlemen and take care of our country because our country takes care of us, instead of the commercialized cads we <b>are,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> and anything for money, and selling our souls and bodies by the pound and the inch after wasting half the day haggling over the price. Decidedly, whether you think Jesus was God or not, you must admit that he was a first-rate political economist.|$|E
