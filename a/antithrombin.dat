5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, {{but it was not}} until the 1950s that the serpins <b>antithrombin</b> and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is <b>antithrombin,</b> which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, <b>antithrombin</b> undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of <b>antithrombin</b> is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and <b>antithrombin</b> is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment for most thrombophilias, but recurrent episodes of thrombosis {{may be an}} indication for long-term preventative anticoagulation. The first major form of thrombophilia, <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency, was identified in 1965, while the most common abnormalities (including factor V Leiden) were described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In North American and European populations, around 4–8% {{of people}} have a thrombophilia, most {{commonly}} factor V leiden and prothrombin G20210A. For populations in China, Japan, and Thailand, deficiences in protein S, protein C, and <b>antithrombin</b> predominate. Non-O blood type is present in around 50% {{of the general population}} and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE. Altogether, global data is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating <b>antithrombin.</b> Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased <b>antithrombin.</b> This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (<b>antithrombin),</b> the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked <b>antithrombin</b> variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of <b>antithrombin,</b> heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by <b>antithrombin,</b> PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which {{increases the risk of}} bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. <b>Antithrombin</b> deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), <b>antithrombin</b> (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of <b>antithrombin),</b> the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in <b>antithrombin,</b> protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon <b>antithrombin</b> and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E
25|$|The 3-dimensional {{structure}} of native <b>antithrombin</b> was first determined in 1994. Unexpectedly the protein crystallized as a heterodimer composed of one molecule of native <b>antithrombin</b> and one molecule of latent <b>antithrombin.</b> Latent <b>antithrombin</b> on formation immediately links to a molecule of native <b>antithrombin</b> {{to form the}} heterodimer, {{and it is not}} until the concentration of latent <b>antithrombin</b> exceeds 50% of the total <b>antithrombin</b> that it can be detected analytically. Not only is the latent form of <b>antithrombin</b> inactive against its target coagulation proteases, but its dimerisation with an otherwise active native <b>antithrombin</b> molecule also results in the native molecules inactivation. The physiological impact of the loss of <b>antithrombin</b> activity either through latent <b>antithrombin</b> formation or through subsequent dimer formation is exacerbated by the preference for dimerisation to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and latent <b>antithrombin</b> as opposed to α-antithrombin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> is also termed <b>Antithrombin</b> III (AT III). The designations <b>Antithrombin</b> I {{through to}} <b>Antithrombin</b> IV {{originate}} in early studies {{carried out in}} the 1950s by Seegers, Johnson and Fell.|$|E
25|$|Type II <b>antithrombin</b> {{deficiency}} is characterised by normal <b>antithrombin</b> levels but reduced <b>antithrombin</b> {{activity in}} the blood of affected individuals. Originally it was proposed that type II deficiency be further divided into three subgroups IIa, IIb and IIc depending upon which <b>antithrombin</b> functional activity is reduced or retained.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of inherited <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency {{has been estimated}} at between 1:2000 and 1:5000 in the normal population, with the first family suffering from inherited <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency being described in 1965. Subsequently, it was proposed that the classification of inherited <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency be designated as either type I or type II, based upon functional and immunochemical <b>antithrombin</b> analyses. Maintenance of an adequate level of <b>antithrombin</b> activity, which is at least 70% that of a normal functional level is essential to ensure effective inhibition of blood coagulation proteases. Typically {{as a result of}} type I or type II <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency, functional <b>antithrombin</b> levels are reduced to below 50% of normal.|$|E
25|$|A form of <b>antithrombin</b> {{that is an}} {{intermediate}} in the conversion between native and latent forms of <b>antithrombin</b> has also been isolated {{and this has been}} termed prelatent <b>antithrombin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> (AT) {{is a small}} protein {{molecule}} that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system. <b>Antithrombin</b> is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and consists of 432 amino acids. It contains three disulfide bonds {{and a total of}} four possible glycosylation sites. α-Antithrombin is the dominant form of <b>antithrombin</b> found in blood plasma and has an oligosaccharide occupying each of its four glycosylation sites. A single glycosylation site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of <b>antithrombin,</b> β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the anticoagulant drug heparin, which enhances the binding of <b>antithrombin</b> to factor IIa (Thrombin) and factor Xa.|$|E
25|$|Type I <b>antithrombin</b> {{deficiency}} is characterised by {{a decrease}} in both <b>antithrombin</b> activity and <b>antithrombin</b> concentration {{in the blood of}} affected individuals. Type I deficiency was originally further divided into two subgroups, Ia and Ib, based upon heparin affinity. The <b>antithrombin</b> of subgroup Ia individuals showed a normal affinity for heparin while the <b>antithrombin</b> of subgroup Ib individuals showed a reduced affinity for heparin. Subsequent functional analysis of a group of 1b cases found them not only to have reduced heparin affinity but multiple or 'pleiotrophic' abnormalities affecting the reactive site, the heparin binding site and <b>antithrombin</b> blood concentration. In a revised system of classification adopted by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type Ib cases are now designated as type II PE, Pleiotrophic effect.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for the {{important}} role <b>antithrombin</b> plays in regulating normal blood coagulation is demonstrated by the correlation between inherited or acquired <b>antithrombin</b> deficiencies and {{an increased risk of}} any affected individual developing thrombotic disease. <b>Antithrombin</b> deficiency generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.|$|E
25|$|Native <b>antithrombin</b> can be {{converted}} to latent <b>antithrombin</b> (L-antithrombin) by heating alone or heating in the presence of citrate. However, without extreme heating and at 37°C (body temperature) 10% of all <b>antithrombin</b> circulating in the blood is converted to the L-antithrombin over a 24-hour period. The structure of L-antithrombin is shown in Figure 6.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> is {{approved}} by the FDA as an anticoagulant {{for the prevention of}} clots before, during, or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Protease {{inactivation}} {{results as}} a consequence of trapping the protease in an equimolar complex with <b>antithrombin</b> in which the active site of the protease enzyme is inaccessible to its usual substrate. The formation of an antithrombin-protease complex involves an interaction between the protease and a specific reactive peptide bond within <b>antithrombin.</b> In human <b>antithrombin</b> this bond is between arginine (arg) 393 and serine (ser) 394 (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|In the {{structures}} shown in Figure 5 the C-terminal portion (P' side) of the reactive site loop {{is in an}} extended conformation when compared with other un-activated or heparin activated <b>antithrombin</b> structures. The P' region of <b>antithrombin</b> is unusually long relative to the P' region of other serpins and in un-activated or heparin activated <b>antithrombin</b> structures forms a tightly hydrogen bonded β-turn. P' elongation occurs through the breaking of all hydrogen bonds involved in the β-turn.|$|E
25|$|They {{all have}} four {{potential}} N-glycosylation sites. These occur at asparagine (Asn) amino acid numbers 96, 135, 155, and 192 in humans and at similar amino acid numbers in other species. All these sites are occupied by covalently attached oligosaccharide side-chains in the predominant form of human <b>antithrombin,</b> α-antithrombin, {{resulting in a}} molecular weight for this form of <b>antithrombin</b> of 58,200. The potential glycosylation site at asparagine 135 is not occupied in a minor form (around 10%) of <b>antithrombin,</b> β-antithrombin (see Figure 1).|$|E
25|$|Presently it is {{relatively}} easy to characterise a specific <b>antithrombin</b> genetic mutation. However prior to the use of modern characterisation techniques investigators named mutations for the town or city where the individual suffering from the deficiency resided i.e. the <b>antithrombin</b> mutation was designated a toponym. Modern mutational characterisation has since shown that many individual <b>antithrombin</b> toponyms are actually the result of the same genetic mutation, for example Antithrombin-Toyama, is equivalent to Antihrombin-Kumamoto, -Amien, -Tours, -Paris-1, -Paris-2, -Alger, -Padua-2 and -Barcelona.|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{may affect}} mRNA {{processing}} of the <b>antithrombin</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the {{serine protease}}s: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased {{by the presence}} of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of <b>antithrombin</b> (inborn or acquired, e.g., in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the revised}} system of {{classification}} again {{adopted by the}} Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type II <b>antithrombin</b> deficiency remains subdivided into three subgroups: the already mentioned type II PE, along with type II RS, where mutations effect the reactive site and type II HBS, where mutations effect the <b>antithrombin</b> heparin binding site. For the purposes of an <b>antithrombin</b> mutational database compiled {{by members of the}} Plasma Coagulation Inhibitors Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type IIa cases are now classified as type II PE, type IIb cases as type II RS and type IIc cases as type II HBS.|$|E
25|$|Minor insertions or deletions {{may lead}} to frame shift {{mutations}} and premature termination of the <b>antithrombin</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{protease}} enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes {{as a consequence of}} their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the <b>antithrombin</b> reactive bond causes <b>antithrombin</b> to become activated and trap the enzyme at an intermediate stage of the proteolytic process. Given time, thrombin is able to cleave the reactive bond within <b>antithrombin</b> and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However bonds P3-P4 and P1'-P2' can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the bacterial enzyme thermolysin respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit thrombin activity.|$|E
25|$|The normal <b>antithrombin</b> {{concentration}} in human blood plasma is high at approximately 0.12mg/ml, which {{is equivalent to}} a molar concentration of 2.3 μM.|$|E
25|$|Increased Factor IXa and Xa {{inhibition}} {{requires the}} minimal heparin pentasaccharide sequence. The conformational {{changes that occur}} within <b>antithrombin</b> in response to pentasaccharide binding are well documented.|$|E
25|$|The hinge {{region of}} <b>antithrombin</b> in the Figure 5 complex {{could not be}} {{modelled}} due to its conformational flexibility, and amino acids P9-P14 are not seen in this structure. This conformational flexibility indicates an equilibrium may exist within the complex between a P14 P15 reactive site loop inserted <b>antithrombin</b> conformation and a P14 P15 reactive site loop expelled conformation. In support of this, analysis of the positioning of P15 Gly in the Figure 5 complex (labelled in model B) shows it to be inserted into beta sheet A (see model C).|$|E
