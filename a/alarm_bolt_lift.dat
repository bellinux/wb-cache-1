50|$|The Weatherby Mark V {{action has}} {{remained}} virtually unchanged {{from the original}} design of Fred Jennie and Roy Weatherby which {{is a testament to}} the longevity of the design. Nevertheless, some refinement to the design has occurred over time. The Mark V action is a front locking, push feed, bolt action repeater. The lug arrangement allows for 54° <b>bolt</b> <b>lift.</b> This shorter <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> allows for increased clearance between the bolt handle and any accessories such as scopes that may be mounted on the rifle and arguably provides for faster cycling of the action. This compares favorably with the Mauser style rifles which have a 90° <b>bolt</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{safe working}} load (SWL) should, {{according}} to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on {{the configuration of the}} equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye <b>bolts,</b> <b>lifting</b> magnets and lifting beams should also be marked. [...] The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely. Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.|$|R
50|$|Weatherby's first {{break with}} Mauser actions came in 1956 when he {{commissioned}} the Danish firm of Schultz & Larsen to build 378 Weatherby Magnums utilizing their Model 54 bolt action. This action was very stout and featured four rear locking lugs. Many of its features (such as the low <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> and triple gas escape ports in the bolt) would {{find their way}} into Weatherby's proprietary bolt action, which would make its debut two years later.|$|R
60|$|Edgar ran up {{a narrow}} flight of stone stairs, {{at the top}} of which was a trap-door. He forced back the <b>bolts</b> and <b>lifted</b> it.|$|R
60|$|He roared with laughter, startling the colt, which {{tried to}} <b>bolt</b> and <b>lifted</b> him half {{off the ground}} by his grip on its frightened nose and neck.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Mauser, the <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> arc on the Mosin-Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee-Enfield. The Mauser {{bolt handle}} {{is at the}} rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear {{receiver}} ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the Mannlicher: It is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to Mauser's [...] "third" [...] or [...] "safety" [...] lug.|$|R
60|$|And again, {{struggling}} frantically as the tightening collar {{shut off}} his wind, Ben <b>Bolt</b> was slowly <b>lifted</b> into the air. So wildly did he struggle that, ere his hind feet {{were off the}} floor, he pranced back and forth, {{so that when he}} was heaved clear his body swung like a huge pendulum. Over the chair, he was dropped, and for {{a fraction of a second}} the posture was his of a man sitting in a chair. Then he uttered a terrible cry and sprang.|$|R
50|$|All products, men and supplies, {{as well as}} {{recoverable}} ore, travels up {{and down}} the shaft in a cage. When the hemp rope or chains broke, the cage would plummet uncontrolled {{to the bottom of the}} shaft, killing its occupants or destroying its load. Cages were open to the front and rear, with I-beams on both sides to support the floor. The outside of the I-beams slid through wooden guides {{up and down the}} shaft, top to bottom. Spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage, one each attached to the I-beams through <b>bolts</b> and <b>lifted</b> in the center. The outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous, round head at the end, notched with teeth molded into the rods. The weight of the cage being lifted, lifted the rods, released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.|$|R
50|$|The NEGEV is striker-fired, {{where the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} {{acts as the}} striker, and fires from an open bolt position. A lever-type fire control selector switch is provided (“A”— for fully automatic fire and “R”— for semi-automatic fire), installed {{on the left side}} of the pistol grip, which doubles as a manual safety against accidental firing. The safe “S” position disables the sear mechanism (which makes it impossible to cock the <b>bolt</b> carrier), by <b>lifting</b> the lever responsible for holding the bolt carrier in the forward position and disconnects the trigger mechanism from the sear. The weapon can be secured safe regardless of the position of the bolt carrier group. The cocking handle is equipped with a ratcheting mechanism that immobilizes the partially cocked bolt carrier.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington 788 has two {{distinguishing}} design features. The {{first is}} the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the <b>bolt</b> handle <b>lifts</b> only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The bolt pictured is a pre-1975 locking model from a [...]308 Winchester caliber rifle. The locking bolt requires the safety {{to be in the}} [...] "fire" [...] or [...] "off" [...] position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged. The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt-action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening {{in the bottom of the}} receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.|$|R
50|$|In 1761, the {{experiment}} was expanded, and the 32-gun frigate HMS Alarm was ordered to have her entire bottom coppered, {{in response to the}} terrible condition in which she had returned from service in the West Indies. HMS Alarm was chosen because, in 1761, a letter had been sent regarding the ships condition, saying that the worms from the waters had taken a significant toll on the ship’s wooden hull. Before the copper plates were applied, the hull was covered with Soft stuff, which was simply hair, yarn and brown paper. The copper performed very well, both in protecting the hull from worm invasion and in preventing weed growth for, when in contact with water, the copper produced a poisonous film, composed mainly of copper oxychloride, that deterred these marine organisms. Furthermore, as this film was slightly soluble, it gradually washed away, leaving no way in which marine life could attach itself to the ship. However, it was soon discovered by the Admiralty that the copper bolts used to hold the plates to the hull had reacted with the iron bolts used {{in the construction of the}} ship, rendering many bolts nearly useless. In 1766, because of the poor condition of the iron <b>bolts,</b> <b>Alarms</b> copper was removed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process for}} quickly developing information that is useful for skills training. The process is called job training analysis (JTA). Its main use is to structure skills training at the jobsite. JTA supports structured skills training by identifying the job duties, tasks, and steps and the reasons why those job components are important. The outcome of the JTA process is a worksheet - a training outline based on the knowledge and expertise of experienced workers. Time invested in developing a JTA will result in significantly more time saved when it is used appropriately by skilled trainers. Like a roadmap, JTA saves time and energy. Experimental work at several mine sites helped document, refine, and validate the JTA process. JTAs for two mining jobs - roof <b>bolting</b> and <b>lift</b> truck operation - at two different mine sites are used to illustrate some of the concepts and the specific JTA process described in this report. The work at these two sites was influenced by cooperative work between the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at several other mine sites and prior collaborative work with the U. S. Navy. The mining JTA process is grounded within the military research {{on the design of}} instructional systems. MSHA and NIOSH worked to simplify and apply the military training development model for mining industry use through collaborative work at several mine sites. The JTA process involves three activities: (1) planning, (2) a 1 - to 3 -day workshop where the JTA is developed using facilitated work with subject-matter experts, and (3) followup. Guidelines and considerations for each of these activities are included. Results indicate that the JTA process has been well received and valued by mining industry participants. It blends aspects of health and safety, production, maintenance, and crew coordination. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 2003093...|$|R
5000|$|In 1932-33 some {{substantial}} changes were made. The action {{was changed to}} cock as the <b>bolt</b> handle was <b>lifted,</b> and the trigger was altered to a short, single-stage pull. The Enfield-type cock-on-closing feature used until that time had been carried over from the original P14 and M1917 rifles, and was originally intended to facilitate rapid fire as the action heated up. However, this was unnecessary on a sporting rifle and the Mauser M98 and M1903 Springfield type cock-on-opening bolt was preferred by American sportsmen, so the action was changed accordingly. Other changes for 1932 were that the designations changed for the Model 30A (ex-M30), the Model 30R (carbine) was added, and a floating barrel was introduced instead of the earlier bedding system where the barrel contacted {{the front end of}} the stock. By 1939 all receivers were drilled and tapped to accept a receiver sight. Production stopped in 1940 with the introduction of the Model 720. [...] The 720 was the final improvement of the original Enfield action by Remington, and was only produced for a few years. It was replaced in 1948 by the much-simplified Model 721 and 722 rifles, which were developed eventually into the widely used Model 700 rifles that are still in production today.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} {{enter into the}} detail of my preparations. It was not very easy to arrange, but it was done very well, with a really convincing effect. The sham police invaded the restaurant, whose {{shutters}} were immediately put up. The surprise was perfect. Most of the Hermione Street party {{were found in the}} second cellar, enlarging the hole communicating with the vaults of the great public building. At the first <b>alarm,</b> several comrades <b>bolted</b> through impulsively into the aforesaid vault, where, of course, had this been a genuine raid, they would have been hopelessly trapped. We did not bother about them for the moment. They were harmless enough. The top floor caused considerable anxiety to Horne and myself. There, surrounded by tins of Stone's Dried Soup, a comrade, nick-named the Professor (he was an ex-science student) was engaged in perfecting some new detonators. He was an abstracted, self-confident, sallow little man, armed with large round spectacles, and we were afraid that under a mistaken impression he would blow himself up and wreck the house about our ears. I rushed upstairs and found him already at the door, on the alert, listening, as he said, to 'suspicious noises down below.' Before I had quite finished explaining to him what was going on he shrugged his shoulders disdainfully and turned away to his balances and test-tubes. His was the true spirit of an extreme revolutionist. Explosives were his faith, his hope, his weapon, and his shield. He perished a couple of years afterwards in a secret laboratory through the premature explosion of one of his improved detonators.|$|R
