5|$|During the Battle of Masan in August 1950, Thompson {{was part}} of a unit {{conducting}} an offensive along the Pusan Perimeter. When North Korean troops attacked his company and caused many men to panic <b>and</b> <b>scatter,</b> Thompson stood his ground, refusing orders to evacuate despite being wounded, and covering the retreat of his platoon until he was killed by a grenade. For his actions, Thompson was awarded the Medal of Honor, one of only two African Americans to be so honored in the war.|$|E

As they left the {{forensic}} installations, they covered their faces in front of cameras and did not specify if they had plans {{to carry out a}} funeral for Moreno González. His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E

5|$|Potiorek {{planned to}} launch a {{converging}} attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial transportation hub for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> the Serbian Army.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had walked on the Moon to die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|During the Ming Dynasty (13681644), the Mongols {{enrolled}} in military service were either originally {{prisoners of war}} or they were those who voluntarily submitted to the Ming and settled in China. Others fled their homeland on the northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts, seeking refuge in China where Mongol families found lodging and hospitality. Some Mongols became distinguished military officers, were granted noble ranks, and on rarer occasions became ministers in the state bureaucracy. Mongols of noble lineage socialized with Chinese literati of the two capitals (Nanjing and Beijing) while they also had their sons educated in the Chinese classic texts. Nonetheless, Mongols in the Ming Empire were often held in suspicion by Chinese Ming authorities. Mongols of lower social stature were often accused by Chinese officials of being prone to violence, banditry, and becoming beggars and even prostitutes. Ming officials used the excuse of military campaigns to relocate <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> Mongol troops and families throughout China {{so that they would}} not be concentrated in North China (which neighbored the enemy territory of the Mongol heartland). Wu Tingyun argues that there was a noticeable shift in Ming court policies after the 1449 Tumu Crisis in dealing with the Mongols; he stated that beforehand the Ming court actively encouraged Mongol immigration, and afterwards merely managed those who had already sided with the Ming.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is involved}} in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of pigmentary colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will not be affected (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars).|$|E

Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent cuvette and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E

25|$|All {{aerosols}} both absorb <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> {{solar and}} terrestrial radiation. This is quantified in the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), {{the ratio of}} scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing {{that it is a}} major atmospheric aerosol absorber.|$|E

40|$|E cient interprocessor {{communication}} {{is crucial to}} increasing the performance of parallel computers. In this paper, a special framework is developed on the generalized hypercube, a network that is currently receiving considerable attention. Using this framework as the basic tool, a number of spanning graphs with special properties to t various communication needs, are constructed on the network. The importance of these spanning graphs is demonstrated {{with the development of}} optimal algorithms for four fundamen-tal communication problems, namely, the single node and multinode broadcasting and the single node <b>and</b> multinode <b>scattering,</b> on the generalized hypercube network. Broadcasting is the distribution of the same group of messages from a source processor to all other processors, <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> is the distribution of distinct groups of messages from a source processor to each other processor. We consider broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> from a single processor of the network (single node broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering)</b> <b>and</b> simultaneously from all processors of the network (multinode broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering).</b> For the multinode broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> algorithms a special technique is developed on the generalized hypercube so that messages origi-nating at individual nodes are interleaved in such a manner that no two messages contend for the same edge at any given time. The communication problems are studied under the all-port communication assumption...|$|R
5000|$|The RTE is a {{differential}} equation describing radiance [...] It {{can be derived}} via conservation of energy.

Coherence, polarization and non-linearity are neglected.
