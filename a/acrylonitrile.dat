5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to <b>acrylonitrile</b> as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, <b>acrylonitrile</b> is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of <b>acrylonitrile</b> generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (<b>acrylonitrile</b> butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Most {{butadiene}} is polymerized {{to produce}} synthetic rubber. While polybutadiene {{itself is a}} very soft, almost liquid material, copolymers prepared from mixtures of butadiene with styrene and/or <b>acrylonitrile,</b> such as <b>acrylonitrile</b> butadiene styrene (ABS), <b>acrylonitrile</b> butadiene (NBR) and styrene-butadiene (SBR) are tough and/or elastic. SBR is the material most commonly used {{for the production of}} automobile tires.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{copolymers}} {{are also}} used with styrene. <b>Acrylonitrile</b> butadiene styrene or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a copolymer of <b>acrylonitrile</b> and styrene, toughened with polybutadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a copolymer of styrene with <b>acrylonitrile,</b> and SMA one with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene {{can be used for}} cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis.|$|E
40|$|Under {{conditions}} of the phase transfer catalysis, acylation of (thio) phosphorylacetonitriles by (het) aroyl chlorides affords the Zenol forms of Cacylation products in high yields. Their configurations were studied by IR spectroscopy, dipole moment measurements, and ab initio quantumchemical calculations [B 3 LYP/ 631 G(d) ]. The C=C double bond and the phospho ryl or thiophosphoryl group have an scis arrangement. The possibility of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these conformers is the governing factor responsible for the threedimen sional structures of the compounds under investigation.

Although many tyrosinase inhibitors have been identified, from both natural and synthetic sources, there remains a considerable demand for novel tyrosinase inhibitors that are safer and more effective. Methods: (E) - 2 -Benzoyl- 3 -(substituted phenyl) <b>acrylonitriles</b> (BPA analogs) with a linear β-phenyl-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold were designed and synthesized as potential tyrosinase inhibitors. We evaluated their effects on cellular tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis in murine B 16 F 10 melanoma cells and their ability to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity. Results: BPA analogs exhibited inhibitory activity against mushroom tyrosinase. In particular, BPA 13 significantly suppressed melanin biosynthesis and inhibited cellular tyrosinase activity in B 16 F 10 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A docking study revealed that BPA 13 had higher binding affinity for tyrosinase than kojic acid. Conclusion: BPA 13, which possesses a linear β-phenyl-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold, is a potential candidate skin-whitening agent and treatment for diseases associated with hyperpigmentation.

50|$|Nucleophilic {{conjugate}} addition {{is a type}} {{of organic}} reaction. Ordinary nucleophilic additions or 1,2-nucleophilic additions deal mostly with additions to carbonyl compounds. Simple alkene compounds do not show 1,2 reactivity due to lack of polarity, unless the alkene is activated with special substituents. With α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds such as cyclohexenone it can be deduced from resonance structures that the β position is an electrophilic site which can react with a nucleophile. The negative charge in these structures is stored as an alkoxide anion. Such a nucleophilic addition is called a nucleophilic conjugate addition or 1,4-nucleophilic addition. The most important active alkenes are the aforementioned conjugated carbonyls and <b>acrylonitriles.</b>|$|R
