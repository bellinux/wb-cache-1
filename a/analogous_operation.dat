40|$|Computer {{graphics}} applications require efficient {{tools to}} model geometric objects. The traditional approach based on compute-intensive matrix calculations is error-prone {{due to a}} lack of integration between geometric reasoning and matrix-based algorithms. Clifford algebra offers a solution to these issues since it permits specification of geometry at a coordinate-free level. The best way to exploit the symbolic computing power of geometric (Clifford) algebra is supporting its data types and operators directly in hardware. This paper outlines the architecture of S-CliffoSor (Sliced Clifford coprocessor), a parallelizable embedded coprocessor that executes native Clifford algebra operations. S-CliffoSor is a sliced coprocessor that can be replicated for parallel execution of concurrent Clifford operations. A single slice has been designed, implemented and tested on the Celoxica Inc. RC 1000 board.

One approach for querying Chinese characters involve referencing their dictionary component called radicals. This is advantageous since users would not need to know their pronunciation nor their stroke-order, a requirement in other querying approaches. Currently though, sketching a character’s radical for querying is an unsupported capability in existing systems. Using the geometric-based LADDER sketching language combined with the Sezgin low-level recognizer, we were able to construct an application which can first recognize handwritten sketches of Chinese radical, and then output candidate Chinese characters which contain that radical. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that a geometric-based sketch recognition approach can be used to easily build applications for recognizing symbols related to Chinese characters while having reasonable recognition rates. Unlike current image-based recognition systems, our system also maintains stroke order information of characters. Since stroke order is important in written Chinese, our system can be easily expanded for use in Chinese language education by providing visual feedback to students on correct stroke order...|$|E
40|$|The urge for {{providing}} a better, more physiological method of reconstructing the thoracic oesophagus is very actively felt in paediatric surgery. For in paediatric surgery small defects in the thoracic oesophagus e. g. oesophageal atresia, peptic or caustic strictures, are bypassed with colon or stomach with considerable morbidity {{as a result}} (Otherson et al. 1967, Rehbein and Schweder 1971). In these cases large or small segments of viable oesophagus are resected or bypassed, often inclusive of the lower oesophageal sphincter. In oesophagoplasty for benign disease {{the aim of the}} surgical reconstruction should be threefold: to save as much oesophagus as possible; to preserve the sphincter; to provide the best functional substitute. Some efforts have been made to meet these objectives. Waterston (1964) introduced a technique that preserved the lower oesophageal sphincter, 12, using a pedicled colonsegment. This technique however, brings along the morbidity inherent in colonic substitutes. Pichlmaier (1973) interposed a pedicled segment of jejunum in {{the lower part of the}} oesophagus preserving the lower oesophageal sphincter. This method still has the disadvantage of a vulnerable vascular pedicle and is therefore limited to the lower part of the oesophagus.

Stochastically, this occurs in the following two situations: The first situation concerns a sequence of two-valued bivariate functions, a natural example of which may be found in bivariate branching processes. The second situation, considered in this research, concerns a sequence of single-valued bivariate functions, referred to here as bivariate CDF iterations of the form F(,n) (x,y) = (lamda) (2 ̆ 7 (n)) (G(x),H(y),F(x,y)) = (lamda) (G(,n- 1) (x),H(,n- 1) (y),F(,n- 1) (x,y)), where G(,n) (x) and H(,n) (y), the marginals of F(,n) (x,y), can be expressed, respectively, in terms of suitable functions (phi) (, 1) and (phi) (, 2) as G(,n) (x) = (phi) (, 1) (G(,n- 1) (x)) and H(,n) (y) = (phi) (, 2) (H(,n- 1) (y)). A natural example of this type of CDF iteration occurs in terms of the joint CDF 2 ̆ 7 s of the values of a certain pair of correlated games of perfect information, with iid terminal payoffs having the common cdf F; this is referred to as bivariate 2 ̆ 2 maximin 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 minimax 2 ̆ 2 CDF iteration. An <b>analogous</b> <b>operation,</b> bivariate 2 ̆ 2 maximum 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 minimum 2 ̆ 2 iteration, occurs also in bivariate extremes, on geometric subsequences of the integers. Given the marginal limit laws, the issues of weak convergence and asymptotic independence are studied for both bivariate maximin or minimax CDF iteration and bivariate extremes, with the latter restricted to the case of essentially bounded iid bivariate random vectors;In both cases, the upper Frechet bound (i. e., UFB) appears to play a dominant role in establishing stochastic dependence. In the first case, the UFB provides essentially the only instance of dependence, while, in the latter case, any mixture involving the UFB provides such an instance. In the first case, asymptotic independence holds, essentially, unless the UFB is achieved at a certain critical point, while, in the latter case, asymptotic independence is established for the case when F(x,y) (LESSTHEQ) G(x) H(y) at (x,y) values near a certain critical point...|$|E
