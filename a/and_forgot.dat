5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{stories about the}} origin of the Yellamma cult. The most {{prevalent}} one says that Renuka was the daughter of a Brahmin, married to sage Jamadagni and was the mother of five sons. She used to bring water from the river Malaprabha for the sage's worship and rituals. One day while she was at the river, she saw a group of youths engaged themselves in water sports <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> to return home in time which made Jamadagni to suspect her chastity. He ordered his sons one by one to punish their mother but four of them refused on one pretext or the other. The sage cursed them to become eunuchs and got her beheaded by his fifth son, Parashuram. To everybody's astonishment, Renuka's head multiplied by tens and hundreds and moved to different regions. This miracle made her four eunuch sons and others to become her followers, and worship her head.|$|E

[...] In April 2008, as Bernier hurriedly departed Couillard's home, he left behind confidential, NATO-related briefing notes; they were from the 2008 Bucharest summit. He asked Couillard to destroy them. Couillard, on the other hand, put the notes aside <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> about them until May when she returned the notes to a foreign affairs office.

500|$|The {{death of}} Admiral Horatio D'Ascoyne was {{inspired}} by the collision between HMS Victoria and HMS Camperdown off Tripoli in 1893 because of an order given by Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon. He chose to go down with his ship, saying [...] "It was all my fault"; Victoria was sunk, losing over 350 men. While filming the scene Hamer asked Guinness if he could hold his pose—a salute, facing the camera while the water rose around him—so that the water went over his head; Hamer wanted to show the admiral's cap floating on the surface. Guinness agreed, telling Hamer that as he practiced yoga, he could hold his breath for four minutes. Guinness was attached to the deck by wires to keep him steady and the shot was taken; when Hamer called [...] "cut", the crew began packing up <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> to release Guinness until four minutes after the scene ended.|$|E

The soldiers quickly responded with, [...] "Vive L'Empereur!" [...] Ney, who had boasted to the restored Bourbon king, Louis XVIII, that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, affectionately kissed his former emperor <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> his oath of allegiance to the Bourbon monarch. The two then marched together towards Paris with a growing army. The unpopular Louis XVIII fled to Belgium after realizing he had little political support. On 13 March, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw. Four days later, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia each pledged to put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule.|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{was born}} at Buckingham Palace. She was the fifth {{daughter}} and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later The Prince Consort). The birth caused controversy {{when it was announced}} that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities. Queen Victoria was undeterred and used [...] "that blessed chloroform" [...] for her last pregnancy. A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, [...] "I was amply rewarded <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> all I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!'" [...] Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore: Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of King George III of the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen's older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit. And take your hands off me." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Rabbi Nehemiah, {{this is how}} the {{exchange}} went: Moses asked Aaron why he had not eaten the sacrifice. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood of the sacrifice had entered the innermost sanctuary, but Aaron answered that its blood had not entered into the inner sanctuary. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood had passed outside the sanctuary courtyard, but Aaron replied that it had not. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the priests had offered it in bereavement, and thus disqualified the offering, but Aaron replied that his sons had not offered it, Aaron had. Thereupon Moses exclaimed that Aaron should certainly have eaten it, as Moses had commanded in [...] that they should eat it in their bereavement. Aaron replied with [...] and argued that perhaps what Moses had heard was that it was allowable for those in mourning to eat the special sacrifices for the Inauguration of the Tabernacle, but not the regular ongoing sacrifices. For if [...] instructs that the tithe, which is of lesser holiness, cannot be eaten in mourning, how much more should that prohibition apply to sacrifices like the sin-offering that are more holy. When Moses heard that argument, he replied with [...] that it was pleasing to him, and he admitted his error. Moses did not seek to excuse himself by saying that he had not heard the law from God, but admitted that he had heard it <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor {{played by}} Tom Baker (1974–81) is often {{regarded}} as {{the most popular of}} the Doctors. In polls conducted by Doctor Who Magazine, Baker has lost the [...] "Best Doctor" [...] category only three times: once to Sylvester McCoy in 1990, and twice to David Tennant in 2006 and 2009. Many of the stories from his era are considered to be classics of the series, including The Ark in Space, Genesis of the Daleks, The Brain of Morbius, The Deadly Assassin and The Robots of Death. However, the violent tone of the stories produced by Letts' successor, Philip Hinchcliffe, saw the series come under heavy criticism at home from morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Concerns over violence during this early period led to a lightening of the tone and an erratic decline in both the popularity and quality of the series. Baker has described Hinchcliffe as [...] "amazing" [...] and identified that as his favourite period of his time on the series. He described Hinchcliffe's successor, Graham Williams, as [...] "absolutely devoted" [...] but lacking Hinchcliffe's flair. He has acknowledged that his final producer on the series, John Nathan-Turner, made changes he didn't agree with and they [...] "did not see eye-to-eye really about very much". He said they became good friends afterwards <b>and</b> <b>forgot</b> their disagreements. Baker suggested that he may have stayed in the role for one series too many.|$|E
