25|$|The Chifley Cave, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of Ben Chifley, the recently-retired Federal local member of parliament and former Prime Minister. This cave {{was the first of}} the caves to be lit with electric light, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). Steam cleaning was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{opened with}} a musical number which parodied the song [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] from Mamma Mia! The Movie. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. Awardees received a gold spray-painted raspberry worth $4.97. The Love Guru received three awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay. Worst Picture was the last award given out at the ceremony. John Wilson {{did not agree with}} the voters' determination on The Love Guru, and after viewing the film again in preparation for the ceremony, said to the Associated Press: [...] "A couple of things he did got me to laugh, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> two laughs in a comedy is a high ratio." [...] "The main thing wrong with it is no one said to Myers that it wasn't funny. He managed to offend the entire Indian population and his investors," [...] said Wilson in a statement in The Guardian. Wilson shredded a copy of The Love Guru at the awards ceremony.|$|E

500|$|St. John and {{the writers}} {{received}} {{praise for the}} recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show's canvas. Soap Opera Weekly stated, [...] "They said it couldn't be done. One Life to Live's Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, One Life to Live may just have done it". The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd's identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints {{that he might be}} Todd. [...] By the time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. Soap Opera Weekly called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, [...] "one of those great (<b>and,</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> rare) must-see moments". [...] Soap Opera Digest said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, [...] "St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who's really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker". The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: [...] "We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker's gaze was always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret". The article also credited St. John with maintaining [...] "the [...] relationship of Todd and Starr" [...] and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful.|$|E
500|$|Criminal {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Andy Gill of The Independent called {{it one of}} the highlights of Femme Fatale, along with [...] "Till the World Ends". Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural, commenting that [...] "indeed, such is the shock when the final track, 'Criminal', opens with a little folksong-style flute and guitar figure that one's immediate reaction is that a Midlake soundfile has been accidentally appended to Britney's running-order." [...] Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that [...] "Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy. Seriously, few pop stars can pull off a flute and Brit does it with ease." [...] Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro said that [...] "the verses, chorus and bridge all work perfectly for Ms. Spears, showing that she still has it from all those years ago." [...] Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly called it her best vocal performance of the album, and added that [...] "it has a spark and a mischievous sass to it – <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> anytime Britney shows even just a bit of her old liveliness and independence, we like it." [...] Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commented the song [...] "isn't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monáe , but damn if it’s not catchy and interesting." [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski claimed that the album [...] "s not all dance-floor narcotics", adding that [...] "Inside Out", [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Criminal" [...] "add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the production of Femme Fatale is [...] "polished, intriguing and – best of all – fun", exemplifying [...] "Inside Out", the piano breakdown in [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] and the flute in [...] "Criminal".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian lauded Shakira's originality, opining that [...] "In {{an age of}} personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious {{eccentricity}} {{makes her}} a true star," [...] and commented that [...] "Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric {{that it could be}} the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart" [...] and [...] "The music on Laundry Service gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap." [...] Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs [...] "displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier" [...] and that [...] "no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art," [...] he concluded that [...] "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. <b>And</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from corking to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Structural {{material}} that resembles ordinary, [...] "dicot" [...] or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics {{is produced by}} a number of monocot plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right <b>and,</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produces {{material that}} often is called wood are the palms. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and Cordyline. With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.|$|E

And there is nothing further from my character: in love and in war, I am all for the forward movement; <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of waiting made my purgatory. It is a fact that I loved her a great deal better at the end of them, for love comes, like bread, from a {{perpetual}} rehandling. And besides, I was fallen into a panic of fear. How, if she came no more, how was I to continue to endure my empty days? how was I to fall back and find my interest in the major’s lessons, the lieutenant’s chess, in a twopenny sale in the market, or a halfpenny addition to the prison fare? ...|$|E
60|$|Bernard {{returned}} to the subject another time--he had plenty of opportunities. He spent a portion of {{every day in the}} company of these dear women; <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> were the happiest of his life. The autumn weather was warm and soothing, the quartier was still deserted, and the uproar of the great city, which seemed a hundred miles away, reached them through the dense October air with a softened and muffled sound. The evenings, however, were growing cool, and before long they lighted the first fire of the season in Mrs. Vivian's heavily draped little chimney-piece. On this occasion Bernard sat there with Angela, watching the bright crackle of the wood and feeling that the charm of winter nights had begun. These two young persons were alone together in the gathering dusk; it was the hour before dinner, before the lamp had been lighted.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the mean}} time the peace between Bartley and Marcia {{continued}} unbroken, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of waiting, of suffering, of hoping and dreading, were the happiest of their lives. He {{did his best}} to be patient with her caprices and fretfulness, and he was at least manfully comforting and helpful, and instant in atonement for every failure. She said a thousand times that she should die without him; and when her time came, he thought {{that she was going to}} die before he could tell her of his sorrow for all that he had ever done to grieve her. He did not tell her, though she lived to give him the chance; but he took her and her baby both into his arms, with tears of as much fondness as ever a man shed. He even began his confession; but she said, [...] "Hush! you never did a wrong thing yet that I didn't drive you to." [...] Pale and faint, she smiled joyfully upon him, and put her hand on his head when he hid his face against hers on the pillow, and put her lips against his cheek. His heart was full; he was grateful for the mercy that had spared him; he was so strong in his silent repentance that he felt like a good man.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} a mistake to let the story of the Confessions carry us into exaggerations. The {{brutality}} of his master and the harshness of his life led him to nothing very criminal, but only to wrong acts which are despicable by their meanness, rather than in any sense atrocious. He told lies as readily as the truth. He pilfered things to eat. He cunningly found a means of opening his master's private cabinet, and of using his master's best instruments by stealth. He wasted his time in idle and capricious tasks. When the man, with all the ravity of an adult moralist, describes these misdeeds of the boy, they assume a certain ugliness of mien, and excites a strong disgust which, when the misdeeds themselves are before us in actual life, we experience in a far more considerate form. The effect of calm, retrospective avowal is to create a kind of feeling which is essentially unlike our feeling at what is actually avowed. Still it is clear that his unlucky career as apprentice brought out in Rousseau slyness, greediness, slovenliness, untruthfulness, and the whole ragged regiment of the squalider vices. The evil of his temperament now and always was of the dull smouldering kind, seldom breaking out into active flame. There is a certain sordidness in the scene. You may complain that the details which Rousseau gives of his youthful days are insipid. Yet such things are the web and stuff of life, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of transition from childhood to full manhood in every case mark a crisis. These insipidities test the education of home and family, and they presage definitely what is to come. The roots of character, good or bad, are shown for this short space, and they remain unchanged, though most people learn from their fellows the decent and useful art of covering them over with a little dust, in the shape of accepted phrases and routine customs and a silence which is not oblivion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't bear to have Walter go," [...] she wrote. [...] "I love Jem ever so {{much but}} Walter means {{more to me}} than anyone in the world and I would die if he had to go. He seems so changed these days. He hardly ever talks to me. I suppose he wants to go, too, and feels badly because he can't. He doesn't go about with Jem and Jerry at all. I shall never forget Susan's face when Jem came home in his khaki. It worked and twisted as if she were going to cry, but all she said was, 'You look almost like a man in that, Jem.' Jem laughed. He never minds because Susan thinks him just a child still. Everybody seems busy but me. I wish there was {{something}} I could do but there doesn't seem to be anything. Mother and Nan and Di are busy all the time and I just wander about like a lonely ghost. What hurts me terribly, though, is that mother's smiles, and Nan's, just seem put on from the outside. Mother's eyes never laugh now. It makes me feel that I shouldn't laugh either--that it's wicked to feel laughy. And it's so hard for me to keep from laughing, even if Jem {{is going to be a}} soldier. But when I laugh I don't enjoy it either, as I used to do. There's something behind it all that keeps hurting me--especially when I wake up in the night. Then I cry because I am afraid that Kitchener of Khartoum is right and the war will last for years and Jem may be--but no, I won't write it. It would make me feel as if it were really going to happen. The other day Nan said, 'Nothing can ever be quite the same for any of us again.' It made me feel rebellious. Why shouldn't things be the same again--when everything is over and Jem and Jerry are back? We'll all be happy and jolly again <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> will seem just like a bad dream.|$|E

6000|$|I am in {{receipt of}} endless bounties {{from you and}} {{dazzling}} revelations about you: item: 1st: the grapes of Paradise that arrived yesterday in a bloom of purple and a burst of sweetness that made me--while they cast their Tyrian glamour about--ask more ruefully than ever what porridge poor non-convalescent John Keats mustn't have had: 2d: your exquisite appeal and approach to the good--the really admirable Skinner, who has now wrung tears of emotion from my eyes by bringing them to my knowledge: 3d: your gentle [...] "holograph" [...] letter, just to hand--which treats my stupid reflections on your own patience with such heavenly gentleness. When one is still sickish and shaky (though that, thank goodness, is steadily ebbing) one tumbles wrong--even when one has {{wanted to make the}} most delicate geste in life. But the great thing is that we always tumble together--more and more never apart; and that for that happy exercise and sweet coincidence of agility we may trust ourselves and each other to the end of time. So I gratefully grovel for everything--and for your beautiful and generous inquiry of Skinner ... more than even anything else. The purple clusters are, none the less, of a prime magnificence and of an inexpressible relevance to my state. This is steadily bettering--thanks above all to three successive morning motor-rides that Skinner has taken me, of {{an hour and a half}} each (to-day in fact nearly two hours), while he goes his rounds in a fairly far circuit over the country-side. I sit at cottage and farmhouse doors while he warns and comforts and commands within, <b>and,</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> having been mild and grey and convenient, the effect has been of the last benignity. I am thus exceedingly sustained. And also by the knowledge that you are not being wrenched from your hard-bought foyer and your neighbourhood to your best of brothers. Cramponnez-vous-y. I don't ask you about poor great Paris--I make out as I can by Morton's playing flashlight. And I read Walkley on Chantecler--which sounds rather like a glittering void. I have now dealt with Alfred and Aimée--unprofitable pair. What a strange and compromising French document--in this sense that it affects one as giving so many people and things away, by the simple fact of springing so characteristically and almost squalidly out of them. The letter in which Alf. arranges for her to come into his dirty bedroom at 8 a.m., while his mother and brother and others unknowingly grouillent on the other side of the cloison that shall make their nid d'amour, and la façon dont elle y vole react back even upon dear old George rather fatally--àpropos of dirty bedrooms, thin cloisons and the usual state of things, one surmises, at that hour. What an Aimée and what a Paul and what a Mme Jaubert and what an everything! ...|$|E
