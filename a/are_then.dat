50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be excavated. The bucket <b>is</b> <b>then</b> lowered and the dragrope <b>is</b> <b>then</b> drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The bucket <b>is</b> <b>then</b> lifted by using the hoist rope. A swing operation <b>is</b> <b>then</b> performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope <b>is</b> <b>then</b> released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|R
50|$|The Ghost <b>was</b> <b>then</b> {{defeated}} by Sunturion, but escaped and <b>was</b> <b>then</b> {{defeated by}} Ultron.|$|R

5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that <b>are</b> <b>then</b> externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to identify migration intensity {{makes use of}} upward pointing microphones to record the nocturnal contact calls of flocks flying overhead. These <b>are</b> <b>then</b> analyzed in a laboratory to measure time, frequency and species.|$|E

5|$|Collected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing sand is {{purified}} by spiral concentrators {{to remove}} lighter materials, which <b>are</b> <b>then</b> {{returned to the}} water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements.

5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves <b>are</b> <b>then</b> selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals <b>are</b> <b>then</b> related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 32 of Hákonar saga Góða, Haakon I of Norway {{is given}} a pagan burial, which is {{described}} as sending {{him on his way}} to Valhalla. Verses from Hákonarmál <b>are</b> <b>then</b> quoted in support, themselves containing references to Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|In most situations, revenue-maximizing {{prices are}} not profit-maximizing prices. For example, if {{variable}} costs per unit are nonzero (which they almost always <b>are),</b> <b>then</b> {{a more complex}} computation of a similar kind yields prices that generate optimal profits.|$|E
50|$|A {{model of}} the inner bell <b>is</b> <b>then</b> {{constructed}} of stone and coated with fireproof cement. It <b>is</b> <b>then</b> smoothed to remove any irregularities.|$|R
50|$|Alberto-Culver <b>was</b> <b>then</b> {{bought by}} Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch {{multinational}} consumer goods company. The product line <b>was</b> <b>then</b> further developed as more products were added.|$|R
50|$|In scotch-tape-based microcleavage, phosphorene is {{mechanically}} exfoliated from a bulk {{of black}} phosphorus crystal using scotch-tape. Phosphorene <b>is</b> <b>then</b> transferred on a Si/SiO2 substrate, where it <b>is</b> <b>then</b> cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol and methanol {{to remove any}} scotch tape residue. The sample <b>is</b> <b>then</b> heated to 180 °C to remove solvent residue.|$|R
5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants <b>are</b> <b>then</b> given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia is a {{federation}} of 13 states and three federal territories. These are divided between two regions, with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia {{and the other}} two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia. Each state is divided into districts, which <b>are</b> <b>then</b> divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions.|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes <b>are</b> <b>then</b> pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{starts with}} 100 g graphite and 50 g of sodium nitrate in sulfuric acid at 66 °C which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> cooled to 0 °C. 300 g of potassium permanganate <b>is</b> <b>then</b> {{added to the}} solution and stirred. Water <b>is</b> <b>then</b> added in increments until the solution is approximately 32 liters.|$|R
50|$|The process {{involved}} the melting of pig iron in an oxidising atmosphere. The metal <b>was</b> <b>then</b> allowed to cool, broken up by stamping, and washed. The granulated iron <b>was</b> <b>then</b> heated in pots in a reverberatory furnace. The resultant bloom <b>was</b> <b>then</b> drawn out under a forge hammer {{in the usual}} way.|$|R

5|$|Niobium {{is used in}} {{arc welding}} rods for some {{stabilized}} grades of stainless steel and in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which <b>are</b> <b>then</b> usually plated with platinum.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} reading, the {{minister}} responsible for moving the bill usually makes a speech explaining the objects and reasons behind the bill. The general merits {{and principles of}} the bill <b>are</b> <b>then</b> debated.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses {{replicate}} their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies {{from their}} RNA; these DNA copies <b>are</b> <b>then</b> transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another, and telomerase contains an RNA {{that is used}} as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|The water-jet-cut {{aluminum}} exoskeleton <b>is</b> <b>then</b> matted to a micro winding using 90% less fine copper wire. A low impedance/high impedance pickup <b>is</b> <b>then</b> created.|$|R
50|$|The meat {{is first}} finely ground and mixed with water. The mixture <b>is</b> <b>then</b> {{used in a}} {{centrifuge}} or with an emulsifier to separate the fats and myoglobin from the muscle. The product <b>is</b> <b>then</b> allowed to settle into three layers: meat, excess water, and fat. The remaining liquefied meat <b>is</b> <b>then</b> flash-frozen and packaged.|$|R
50|$|Purine {{degradation}} {{takes place}} {{mainly in the}} liver of humans and requires an assortment of enzymes to degrade purines to uric acid. First, the nucleotide will lose its phosphate through 5'-nucleotidase. The nucleoside, adenosine, <b>is</b> <b>then</b> deaminated and hydrolyzed to form hypoxanthine via adenosine deaminase and nucleosidase respectively. Hypoxanthine <b>is</b> <b>then</b> oxidized to form xanthine and then uric acid through the action of xanthine oxidase. The other purine nucleoside, guanosine, is cleaved to form guanine. Guanine <b>is</b> <b>then</b> deaminated via guanine deaminase to form xanthine which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> converted to uric acid. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the degradation of both purines. Uric acid <b>is</b> <b>then</b> excreted from the body in different forms depending on the animal.|$|R
