5|$|An ironclad is a steam-propelled warship {{protected}} by iron or steel armor plates {{used in the}} early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge of}} murder {{as a crime}} against {{humanity}} was made by the prosecutor in relation to multiple attacks {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the election.

Additionally the prosecutor alleges that network members attacked the Huruma, Kiambaa, Kimumu, Langas and Yamumbi areas of Eldoret, resulting in 70 to 87 deaths. It is alleged that during the attack in Kaimbaa several people took refuge in a church which was locked from outside and then burned down causing between 17 and 35 people to be burned to death. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that the towns of Kapsabet and Nandi Hills town were attacked by network members.|$|E

Each of the 24 regions was administered by 24 officials, who had under their command 240 armies of spirits, composed of 2400 generals, 2400 officers and 240000 soldiers.

30|$|The {{first phase}} (i.e., up to 200 s in the figure) {{represents}} the normal {{behavior of the}} network when all the sensor nodes are active. HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> cell at the center presents a higher average success ratio compared to LBDD <b>and</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> ring at the center during this phase. Because LBDD <b>and</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> ring at the center have to flood the sink queries within the virtual infrastructure (i.e., line strip in LBDD and hexagonal ring in HexDD) to reach the node storing the requested data, the probability of collision is thus higher and the application is less reliable. This is why their obtained average success ratio are slightly lower than HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> cell at the center. In the second phase, which occurs at an instant around 200 s and the nodes start to die, LBDD <b>and</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> ring present a higher average success ratio compared to HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> cell. Since they have a larger virtual infrastructure, the energy consumption of LBDD <b>and</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> ring is distributed over the entire rendezvous area, avoiding thus the hot spot problem {{and the existence of}} critical nodes such as the central nodes of HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> cell at the center. Larger infrastructure introduces more redundancy between nodes, increasing the protocol robustness. This directly impacts the application success ratio which remains higher <b>with</b> LBDD <b>and</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> ring than <b>with</b> HexDD <b>with</b> <b>one</b> central cell.|$|R

Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E
