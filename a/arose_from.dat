50|$|The {{obturator}} artery sometimes <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> {{the main}} stem {{or from the}} posterior trunk of the internal iliac artery, or it may <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the superior gluteal artery; occasionally it <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> the external iliac.|$|R
50|$|Caretaker genes encode {{products}} that stabilize the genome. Fundamentally, mutations in caretaker genes lead to genomic instability. Tumor cells <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> two distinct classes of genomic instability: mutational instability <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> {{changes in the}} nucleotide sequence of DNA and chromosomal instability <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> improper rearrangement of chromosomes.|$|R

5|$|A {{movement}} by women <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt’s book It’s Up to the Women, women pushed for recognition, {{not just as}} housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals Working Woman and The Woman Today, women pushed {{to be seen as}} equal and receive some recognition.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no serious}} {{injuries}} <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> any short-pitched deliveries while a leg theory field was actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling {{between the two}} teams, particularly when Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena.|$|E
5|$|Another account, {{involving}} seafaring, {{holds that}} the name <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> the misfortune of a mariner afloat.

5|$|Decades, and in {{some cases}} centuries, of British rule and {{emigration}} have left their mark on the independent nations that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> the British Empire.

5|$|In part, Political Animals and Animal Politics <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> a {{workshop}} Wissenburg and Schlosberg organised at the 2012 European Consortium for Political Research Joint Sessions conference, {{though not all}} attendees contributed to the volume and not all contributors presented at the workshop.

5|$|No {{subspecies}} or {{varieties of}} Banksia verticillata have been identified; {{it has no}} taxonomic synonyms; and its only nomenclatural synonym is Sirmuellera verticillata (R.Br.)

40|$|Heterotopic {{pancreas}} {{is mostly}} found incidentally, and adenocarcinoma <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> heterotopic pancreas {{appears to be}} extremely rare. A case of a 46 -year-old woman with adenocarcinoma <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> intrahepatic heterotopic pancreas is reported herein. Computed tomography demonstrated a mass located in the bile duct of the left hepatic lobe. Pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> intrahepatic heterotopic pancreas with nerve infiltration.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{three different}} topics. The first {{has to do}} with axiomatizing the universal theory of certain classes of multisorted algebras <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> intersection, union, and other first order operations on relations. The second {{has to do with}} axiomatizing certain classes of actions <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> intersection and union, and axiomatizing certain classes of posets <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> actions <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> intersection. The third has to do with understanding under what conditions morphisms between two structures can be finitely determined...|$|R

5|$|Post-crash {{analysis}} of the crack surfaces showed {{the presence of a}} penetrating fluorescent dye used to detect cracks during maintenance. The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present and should have been detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} vampire bats <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin. Within 4 million years of diverging from other Phyllostomids, vampire bats had evolved all necessary adaptations for blood-feeding, {{making it one}} of the fastest examples of natural selection among mammals.|$|E
5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera. The elevated temperatures of the caldera lake suggest that hydrothermal activity still occurs beneath Incapillo.|$|E
40|$|Nasal polyps are benign prolapsed mucosal lesions which {{commonly}} <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the {{paranasal sinuses}} and lateral {{walls of the}} nose especially the contact areas of osteomeatal complex. Though nasal polyps <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the nasal septum have been reported, those <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> its anterior part are extremely rare and present a diagnostic dilemma.

50|$|Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> {{the soft tissue}} that surrounds nerves. They are a type of sarcoma.

5|$|This {{cladogram}} {{is based}} on Debevic et al, 2012, which used molecular phylogeny {{to demonstrate that the}} bees (Anthophila) <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic. The placement of the Heterogynaidae is uncertain. The small subfamily Mellininae was not included in their analysis.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> the disagreements {{that occurred}} between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began {{during the battle}} and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E
5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversy}} <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> {{the film}} when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams {{of the late}} 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film described how they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|Competition <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> other genres. Players {{turned away}} from RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. Later RPGs would draw influences from action genres, but would face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
