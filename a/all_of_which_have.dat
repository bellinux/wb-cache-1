5|$|Currently, four {{subspecies}} of ringneck are recognised, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> {{been described}} as distinct species in the past: (As of 1993, the twenty-eight and Cloncurry parrot were treated as subspecies of the Port Lincoln parrot and the mallee ringneck, respectively).|$|E

5|$|The {{coronation}} of the British monarch is {{a ceremony}} (specifically, initiation rite) {{in which the}} monarch of the United Kingdom is formally invested with regalia and crowned at Westminster Abbey. It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in other European monarchies, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> seven similar peptide rings. Although they are highly toxic to liver cells, phallotoxins have since {{been found to have}} little input into the {{destroying}} angel's toxicity as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, one phallotoxin, phalloidin, is also found in the edible (and sought-after) blusher (Amanita rubescens).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, {{most of the land}} being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> lava flows; {{the last one}} also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent flows from Licancabur and flows from Sairecabur. Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and {{tend to be more}} basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is an {{extremely}} radioactive element: its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.8seconds. In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth. Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and to be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.|$|E
5|$|Over its 85 million year history, the Hawaii hotspot {{has created}} at least 129 volcanoes, more than 123 {{of which are}} extinct volcanoes, seamounts, and atolls, four of which are active volcanoes, and {{two of which are}} dormant volcanoes. They can be {{organized}} into three general categories: the Hawaiian archipelago, which comprises most of the U.S. state of Hawaii and is the location of all modern volcanic activity; the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which consist of coral atolls, extinct islands, and atoll islands; and the Emperor Seamounts, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> since eroded and subsided to the sea and become seamounts and guyots (flat-topped seamounts).|$|E
50|$|WSLA's offices, transmitter, and tower {{are located}} in Slidell, LA. The station {{experienced}} flooding and some roof damage during Hurricane Katrina, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> since been repaired.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the last}} 14.5million years, the Anahim hotspot has created at least 40volcanoes. They can be {{organized}} into three groupings: the eastern section, which comprises several small cinder cones {{and is the}} location of all modern volcanic activity; the central section, which consists of predominantly shield volcanoes; and the western section, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> since been reduced to remnants of eruptive breccia and high-level plutons and dike swarms. These form {{one of the six}} Neogene-Quaternary volcanic provinces in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Policing is {{provided}} by the Lincolnshire Police, and fire-fighting by the Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service. The police station is on Boston Road, although older premises on Kesteven Street were erected in 1845 and reconstructed in 1912. The fire station is on Church Lane although plans to move it to East Road by 2016 were approved in 2014. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) operates from Kesteven Street. The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides services at three hospitals, Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Grantham and District Hospital, and Lincoln County Hospital, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> 24-hour accident and emergency departments as of January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E

5|$|The Sala das Mangas (the only room in {{the state}} apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (illustrated below). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.|$|E
5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was {{isolated}} in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the death cap's toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin {{is also found in}} the edible (and sought-after) Blusher (Amanita rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other Harry Potter related license holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author. The books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular film adaptations produced by Warner Bros., <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been highly successful in their own right. The films have in turn spawned eight video games and {{have led to the}} licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products. The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25billion.|$|E
