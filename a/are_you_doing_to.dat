500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I do for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

6000|$|Thus Prideaux prattles on, about Admiral Van Tromp, [...] "a drunken greazy Dutchman," [...] whom Speed, of St. John's, conquered in boozing; of the {{disputes}} about races in Port Meadow; of the {{breaking into the}} Mermaid Tavern. [...] "We Christ Church men bear the blame of it, our ticks, as {{the noise of the}} town will have it, amounting to 1,500 pounds." [...] Thus Christ Church had little cause to throw the first stone at Balliol. Prideaux shows little interest in letters, little in the press, though he lived in palmy days of printing, in the time of the Elzevirs; none at all in the educational work of the place. He sneers at the Puritans, and at the controversy on [...] "The Foundations of Hell Torments shaken and removed." [...] He admits that Locke [...] "is a man of very good converse, but is chiefly concerned to spy out the movements of the philosopher, suspected of sedition, and to report them to Ellis in town. About the new buildings, as of the beautiful western gateway, where Great Tom is hung, the work of Wren, Prideaux says little; St. Mary's was suffering restoration, and [...] "the old men," [...] including Wood, we may believe, [...] "exceedingly exclaim against it." [...] That is the way of Oxford, a college is constantly rebuilding amid the protests {{of the rest of the}} University. There is no question more common, or less agreeable than this, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> your tower?" [...] or [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> your hall, library, or chapel?" [...] No one ever knows; but we are always doing something, and working men for ever sit, and drink beer, on the venerable roofs.|$|E
6000|$|So far the {{movement}} towards a world state has lacked any driving power of passion. We have been {{passing through a}} phase of intellectual revision. The idea of a world unity and brotherhood has come back again into the world almost apologetically, deferentially, asking for the kind words of successful politicians and for a gesture of patronage from kings. Yet this demand for one world-empire of righteousness was inherent in the teachings of Buddha, it flashed {{for a little while}} behind the sword of Islam, it is the embodiment in earthly affairs of the spirit of Christ. It is a call to men for service as of right, it is not an appeal to them that they may refuse, not a voice that they may disregard. It is too great a thing to hover for long thus deferentially {{on the outskirts of the}} active world it has come to save. To-day the world state says [...] "Please listen; make way for me." [...] To-morrow it will say: [...] "Make way for me, little people." [...] The day is not remote when disregardful [...] "patriotic" [...] men hectoring in the crowd will be twisted round perforce to the light they refuse to see. First comes the idea and then slowly the full comprehension of the idea, comes realization, and with that realization will come a kindling anger at the vulgarity, the meanness, the greed and baseness and utter stupidity that refuses to attend to this clear voice, this definite demand of our racial necessity. To-day we teach, but as understanding grows we must begin to act. We must put ourselves and our rulers and our fellow men on trial. We must ask: [...] "What have you done, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> help or hinder the peace and order of mankind?" [...] A time will come when a politician who has wilfully made war and promoted international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose than a private homicide. It is not reasonable that those who gamble with men's lives should not stake their own. The service of the world state calls for much more than passive resistance to belligerent authorities, for much more than exemplary martyrdoms. It calls for the greater effort of active interference with mischievous men. [...] "I will believe in the League of Nations," [...] one man has written, [...] "when men will fight for it." [...] For this League of Nations at Geneva, this little corner of Balfourian jobs and gentility, no man would dream of fighting, but for the great state of mankind, men will presently be very ready to fight and, as the thing may go, either to kill or die. Things must come in their order; first the idea, then the kindling of imaginations, then the world wide battle. We who live in the bleak days after a great crisis, need be no more discouraged by the apparent indifference of the present time than are fields that are ploughed and sown by the wet days of February and the cold indifference of the winds of early March. The ploughing has been done, and the seed is in the ground, and the world state stirs in a multitude of germinating minds.|$|E
