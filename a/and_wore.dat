(2) the 201 HTC modified by carbon following the initial mill for oil storage of the micro-groove to be produced, increased the corresponding lubrication performance reduced the friction coefficient <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> rate effectively. (3) the 201 HT- 201 HTC could obtain both better friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> mainly due to the initial process of grinding following the 201 HT plastic deformation occurred in the surface {{and the formation of}} a series of re-melting welding points, whereas the 201 HT material hardness would be similar to the 201 HTC material hardness, which led into the competitive material friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance improvement...|$|R
