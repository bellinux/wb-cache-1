5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask <b>a</b> <b>schoolgirl</b> to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E

5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted the role of <b>a</b> <b>schoolgirl</b> in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E
5|$|At age 7 Coyne {{enrolled}} in the Gene Kelly Studio of Dance in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and developed <b>a</b> <b>schoolgirl</b> crush on him In her twenties she was cast in Best Foot Forward, where she reconnected with Kelly and first met Donen, later moving to Hollywood with them. She and Donen eloped in 1948, but their marriage became strained. They separated in 1950 and divorced in 1951. During their marriage Donen confided to Coyne his frustration with Kelly while making On the Town, {{only to find that}} she immediately took Kelly's side. Coyne worked as Kelly's personal assistant on several films while married to Donen and continued assisting Kelly until her death. Rumors held that Kelly and Coyne were having an affair both during and after Coyne's marriage to Donen, as well as that Donen was in love with Kelly's first wife Betsy Blair. Blair's autobiography makes no mention of an affair between Kelly and Coyne nor of any romantic relationship with Donen. However, she does state that Donen's marriage to Coyne was unhappy and that Donen was very close to both her and Kelly.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an 11-year-old Kylie Minogue was {{established}} as a child actress, appearing as a cameo actress in the TV series The Sullivans and Skyways. Both Minogue and her sister Dannii Minogue were both child stars trying to achieve success in the TV industry of Australia, but Dannii received better opportunities as a TV actress than Kylie. In 1985, Kylie was cast {{as one of the}} lead roles on TV soap The Henderson Kids but her role only lasted one season, and was completed after two seasons. Interested in following a career in music, she made a demo tape for the producers of the weekly music programme Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, <b>a</b> <b>schoolgirl</b> turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan, culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20million British viewers.|$|E

She did not earn much from the job, and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a small part in the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it.
