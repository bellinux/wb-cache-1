5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect the shed and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began {{to take control of}} the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E

Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), building on Pascal's work, {{became one of the}} most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators; he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator, in 1685, and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures.|$|E

However, Lillian Tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round, by looking for the desired prognostication (for example an auspicious marriage day), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> the days on the Liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel ordered German {{armoured}} divisions to the Axis fortress {{positions on}} the Egyptian border but failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk. Rommel had to withdraw from the frontier to Tobruk and achieved some tactical success in costly fighting. The need to preserve his remaining forces from destruction prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> the way back to El Agheila.

25|$|Operation Crusader (4th Indian, 7th Armoured, 1st South African, 2nd New Zealand and 70th British divisions) between 18 November–30 December 1941. The initial {{plan was}} to destroy the Axis {{armoured}} force before advancing its infantry. 7th Armoured were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel's subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the need to preserve his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> the way back to El Agheila.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of I I is done, {{the value of the}} other I I can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|E
25|$|The deflowerment of Lavinia, {{cutting out}} her tongue, {{chopping}} off her hands, and the numerous decapitations which {{occur in the}} original, are wholly omitted, and a play not only presentable but actually attractive is the result. Aaron is elevated into a noble and lofty character; Tamora, the queen of Scythia, is a chaste though decidedly strong-minded female, and her connection with the Moor appears to be of legitimate description; her sons Chiron and Demetrius are dutiful children, obeying the behests of their mother. Thus altered, Mr. Aldridge's conception of the part of Aaron is excellent – gentle and impassioned by turns; now burning with jealousy as he doubts the honour of the Queen; anon, fierce with rage, as he reflects upon the wrongs which have been done him – the murder of Alarbus and the abduction of his son; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> tenderness and emotion in the gentler passages with his infant.|$|E

25|$|Coins {{were one}} of the first objects to bear the image of the reigning {{sovereign}} in what is today Canada. After 1640, French colonists employed the Louis d'or ("Gold Louis", which first bore the effigy of King Louis XIII <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> subsequent French monarchs) until the transfer of New France to the British in 1763. After, British sovereigns and coppers were used, sometimes long {{after the end of the}} reign of the monarch appearing on the coin. The first coins minted specifically for the Province of Canada came in 1858 and had on their obverse the image of Queen Victoria, as did the first coins of the Dominion of Canada. Since then, the reigning sovereign's image has remained on Canadian coins, illustrating the responsibility of the monarch (as personification of the state) to guarantee the value of the medium of exchange. The effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on current Canadian coins was rendered by Susannah Blunt.|$|E
25|$|Each contest has its {{own rules}} {{regarding}} content and contestant judging/scoring. In the International Speech Contest, the contestant selects the subject and type of speech to give, and the speech is judged on the overall presentation using a point system for various categories of skills. In a Humorous Speech Contest the speeches are judged using {{a different set of}} categories, which include how well humor was used. In a Tall Tales Contest, judging is based on speaking skills and use of exaggeration for humorous effect. In an Evaluation Contest (2–3 minutes with 30 seconds overtime grace period), a test speaker gives a speech, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> of the contestants leave the room, returning one at a time to evaluate the same speech. In the Table Topics Contest (1–2 minutes with 30 seconds overtime grace period), contestants are led into the room one at a time and presented with a topic they have not previously been informed of and are judged on how well they respond; each contestant is given the same topic.|$|E
