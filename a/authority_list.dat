50|$|The Llista d’encapçalaments de matèria en català is {{the result}} of the {{translation}} of the Lista de encabezamientos de materia para bibliotecas by Carmen Rovira and Jorge Aguayo, and of the adaptation of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). LEMAC was initially created by the Institut Català de Bibliografia in 1983 and continued later by the National Library of Catalonia. The Lista de encabezamientos de materia para bibliotecas is the Hispanoamerican adaptation of LCSH and was of common use in Spain when the Catalan Government decided to translate it to Catalan language at the late eighties.There are other subject headings lists that are also used or searched to create the LEMAC authority records, such as the Répertoire de vedettes-matière of the Université de Laval (Laval RVM), which is the Canadian accepted rule by the National Library of Canada and, above all, the, inspired on the Canadian version, which is the official subject headings <b>authority</b> <b>list</b> in France.In December 1999, the Llista d’encapçalaments de matèria en català (LEMAC) was codified to machine readable format. In April 2002, it was made available online through the National Library of Catalonia website. LEMAC subject authority records may be viewed in thesaurus format or in MARC21 code.|$|E
40|$|The {{project to}} create an <b>authority</b> <b>list</b> of the ancient Italian states arises {{from the lack of}} such a list in Italy. The {{standardization}} of headings for the ancient states has taken into account all the problems and difficulties arising from the nineteenth-century concept of state - which we refer to. That concept is quite difficult to apply to the Italian states established before that time. The creation of the <b>authority</b> <b>list</b> is mainly based on two sources: the Raccolta di statuti, consuetudini, leggi, decreti, ordini e privilegi dei comuni, delle associazioni e degli enti locali italiani dal Medioevo alla fine del secolo XVIII and the Fondo delle leggi degli antichi Stati italiani, both of which are held in the Senate Library, integrated by the consultation of the OPAC of Servizio bibliotecario nazionale...|$|E

40|$|ACOLIT is an <b>authority</b> <b>list</b> {{of catholic}} authors (persons or {{corporate}} bodies) and of liturgical and religious anonymus works. ACOLIT formulates catalogue entries {{on the basis}} of RICA, but also takes into account the Norme per il catalogo degli stampati of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, the AACR 2 R, the Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung (RAK), the Reglas de catalogación, and the recommendations of IFLA. Three volumes have already been published: Bible, Catholic Church, Roman Curia, Papal State, Vatican, Popes and Antipopes (1997); Catholic religious orders (2000); Liturgical works (2003). The fourth volume is devoted to Fathers of the Church and to Western ecclesiastical Writers (II-XIII centuries).

The principal lemma is the Italian form according to the language of the catalogue. The principal entry is followed by variants.
