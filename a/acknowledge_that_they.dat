5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E

Selene offers to give up {{everything}} – her home, her honour, her life – to be with Sir Ethais. She gives him a ring as a pledge of her love. They {{go back into the}} bower together. Darine has overheard them. She too is wildly in love with Sir Ethais, and is feverishly jealous of Selene. Sir Phyllon enters and tries to court Darine, but she does not return his affection. After Sir Phyllon leaves, Selene re-enters. Sir Ethais has suffered a setback, and she fears he will die. Darine suggests that the only hope is to summon the fairy Lutin's mortal counterpart, who will be able to cure Sir Ethais. Selene is grateful for the suggestion, unaware that Darine intends to woo Sir Ethais for herself, once he is recovered.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} Thursday, Benfica visited Vigo for {{the third}} round of the UEFA Cup. Benfica made club history in the match; at half-time they were already losing 4–0, and three more goals in the second half broke the record for goals conceded, in their worst defeat ever. At their next training session hundreds of fans booed the team, and the club president compelled his players to apologize for their performance. Team captain João Pinto read a statement: [...] "To Benfica, and to their supporters; aware of the abnormality of the result from the match in Vigo; the players, represented by the captain and vice-captain, publicly <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn't perform to club standards. We promise to redouble our commitment, towards dignifying this club. To them and to the millions of fans, we formally apologize."

500|$|The Zimbabwean hockey team's {{victory at}} the 1980 Olympics was widely {{considered}} a great upset. Sports historians have called it a [...] "fairytale" [...] and an [...] "irresistible fairy story". While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of Sports Illustrated, felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, [...] "ruined" [...] the 1980 Olympics. While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in The Sunday Times, that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. [...] "They freely <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{won the gold medal}} without competing against the best in the world", she concludes, [...] "but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance." ...|$|E
500|$|The Superintendency {{has often}} been a {{stepping}} stone to higher prominence in the Army. Four Superintendents became Chief of Staff of the Army: Hugh Lenox Scott, Douglas MacArthur, Maxwell Davenport Taylor, and William Westmoreland. The list of Superintendents includes five Medal of Honor recipients: Oliver Otis Howard, Douglas MacArthur, Albert Leopold Mills, John McAllister Schofield, John Moulder Wilson. Many Superintendents later became Commanding Generals, such as Joseph Gardner Swift. The post is now a terminal assignment in the Army; {{as a condition for}} detail to the position, officers are required by law to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will retire {{at the end of their}} appointment. This formulation was meant to secure the independence of Superintendents from undue command influence; however, in practice the resulting [...] "lame duck" [...] status restricts their power and influence in the Army. There has been discussion about reverting to the previous system or recalling a retired officer to fill the post.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-century, {{there was}} no living memory of the 19th-century evangelicals, and Episcopalians were [...] "reluctant" [...] to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had ever existed.

The evangelical revival in the Episcopal Church {{was part of a}} larger postwar evangelical resurgence known in North America as Neo-Evangelicalism, and it was promoted and supported by Anglicans from England, where evangelical Anglicanism had remained a vibrant tradition throughout the 20th century. The most influential voice from England was John Stott.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{misconception}} about alexithymia is {{that affected}} individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally {{and that they}} may even fail to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as [...] "happy" [...] or [...] "unhappy" [...] when describing these feelings. The core issue is that people with alexithymia have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others. This contributes {{to the sense of}} emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.|$|E

2500|$|Zelaya {{appointed}} {{one of his}} officers, Juan Francisco Zamudio, to lead a mounted {{company to}} face the advancing royalists, who had seized {{the small town of}} Pequereque, {{at the opposite end of}} the ravine. In the meantime, an infantry squadron was deployed in the rearguard along the pass, to prevent any hostile infiltration. The remainder of the regiment was also ordered to march on foot, to mislead the enemy about the real strength of the republicans. The engagement lasted for about five and a half hours, according to the official report sent to General Manuel Belgrano, commander in chief of the army. The royalists eventually gave up, leaving Pequereque in the hands of Zelaya and his men. Three soldiers were killed [...] "...in cold blood after surrender", according to Zelaya's report, and 10 men were injured. He put Olañeta casualties at up to 10 dead and 20 wounded. Royalist sources seem to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffered a number of casualties, without elaborating further. After holding Pequereque during a few hours, Zelaya decided to fall back to Ancacato.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, new {{claims that}} the ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} may not be extinct were released by a research group consisting of members from Auburn University in Alabama and the University of Windsor in Ontario. Dr. Geoffrey E. Hill of Auburn University and Dr. Daniel Mennill of the University of Windsor have revealed a collection of evidence that the birds may still exist in the cypress swamps of the Florida panhandle. Their evidence includes 14 sightings of the birds and 300 recordings of sounds that {{can be attributed to}} the ivory-billed woodpecker, but also includes tell-tale foraging signs and appropriately sized tree nest cavities. This evidence remains inconclusive as it excludes the photographic or DNA evidence that many experts cite as necessary before the presence of the species can be confirmed. While Dr. Hill and Dr. Mennill are themselves convinced of the bird's existence in Florida, they are quick to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have not yet conclusively proven the species' existence. The research team is currently undertaking a more complete survey of the Choctawhatchee River, in hopes of obtaining photographic evidence of the bird's existence.
