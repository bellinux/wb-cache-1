40|$|WSSPC {{recommends}} that each state, province or territory which is considering implementing requirements for installing <b>automatic</b> gas <b>shutoff</b> devices in industrial, commercial and/or residential applications assure that shutoff valves meet {{the provisions of}} the most currently available revision of ANSI/ASCE/SEI Standard 25 (Earthquake-Actuated <b>Automatic</b> Gas <b>Shutoff</b> Devices) and be installed in conformance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. The cost versus benefit of turning gas on after an event or the analysis of false activation is left to the jurisdiction. The policy only advocates that if a decision is made to proceed with earthquake actuated <b>automatic</b> gas <b>shutoff</b> devices that the current state-of-the-art provisions be utilized. Executive Summary Natural gas piping and appliances may be damaged during earthquakes, causing gas leaks. These leaks, if ignited, can result in fires and explosions which may jeopardize personal safety as well as resulting in significant damage to structures. Fires and explosions may be more destructive to buildings than the earthquake itself. The ability to manually shut off a gas valve after an earthquake may be difficult or impossible due to debris or ground movement. Risk of gas related damage is further exacerbated if structures are unoccupied, thus placing the burden of shutting off gas service upon utilities or government agencies. The reliability of <b>automatic</b> gas <b>shutoff</b> valves has been greatly improved with the adoption o...|$|R
50|$|In addition, a stuck or {{malfunctioning}} {{water supply}} valve can deliver large amounts of water, causing extensive water damage if undetected for any period of time. A water alarm, possibly with an <b>automatic</b> water <b>shutoff,</b> can help prevent this malfunction from causing major problems.|$|R
50|$|Other {{protective}} equipment {{includes the}} voltage relay (which trips if the voltage in the high-voltage circuit falls below 2400 V), the dynamotor/compressor overload relay, the heating circuit overload relay, and the <b>automatic</b> control <b>shutoff</b> switch. This last {{shuts off the}} traction motor controls when the air pressure in the brake pipe falls below a preset level, which prevents the train from starting with inoperative brakes.|$|R
50|$|Dover's {{acquisition}} history reaches {{beyond the}} elevator industry. With {{a focus on}} diversification in the 1960s, such as the acquisition of Ohio Pattern Works & Foundry Company in 1961, came notable purchases of companies that {{continue to be a}} significant part of Dover Corporation today. The company was shorthanded to OPW, and in 1949 one of its engineers, Leonard H. Duerr, invented the <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> fuel-dispensing nozzle valve. Today, the basic technology of Duerr's invention continues to exist in <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> nozzles, and OPW is still a part of Dover, specializing in the design and manufacture of commercial and retail-fueling solutions.|$|E

5000|$|For older houses {{where the}} water heater {{is part of the}} space heating boiler, and {{plumbing}} codes allow, some plumbers install an <b>automatic</b> gas <b>shutoff</b> (such as the [...] "Watts 210") in addition to a TPR valve. When the device senses that the temperature reaches , it shuts off the gas supply and prevents further heating. In addition, an expansion tank or exterior pressure relief valve must be installed to prevent pressure buildup in the plumbing from rupturing pipes, valves, or the water heater.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{computer}} and equipment rooms employ an underfloor air distribution to ensure even cooling {{of the room}} with minimal wasted energy. Conditioned air is provided under the floor and dispersed upward into the room through regularly spaced diffuser tiles, blowers or through ducts directed into specific equipment. <b>Automatic</b> fire protection <b>shutoffs</b> may be required for underfloor ventilation, and additional suppression systems may be installed in case of underfloor fires.|$|R

The floor space is then associated with the building code that was in effect during the construction or renovation year, providing a link between existing commercial floor space and its coverage by advanced lighting controls. We make assumptions about demolition, renovation, and compliance rates. We find that mandating full compliance with the current Federal building code would increase commercial floor space with <b>automatic</b> lighting <b>shutoff</b> from 78 % to 90 %...|$|R

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found a gouge in the pipe, probably caused by excavation equipment years earlier; {{in combination with}} brittle pipe material and excessive operating pressures likely led to the rupture. NTSB also found fault {{with the lack of}} <b>automatic</b> or remote-controlled <b>shutoff</b> valves: the manual valves were difficult to reach and close, preventing operators from promptly cutting off gas that fueled the fire. Also, NTSB found that Texas Eastern failed to adequately monitor excavation activity on its right of way.|$|R
50|$|Automatic faucets {{have the}} {{advantage}} of shutting off automatically after hand washing, thereby reducing water waste. When installed in a home, sensor faucets alleviate the need for parents to ensure that children have turned off the faucet. They can also benefit the elderly and those suffering from arthritis or other mobility limiting conditions since there are no handles to twist or pull.

50|$|Of equal {{importance}} was {{the failure}} of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.|$|E

5000|$|On 8 September, BP {{released}} a 193-page report on its web site. The report identified 8 key findings {{with respect to}} the cause of the accident. 1) The day before the accident, cement had been poured to fill the gap between the borehole (the actual hole in the ground) and the casing (the outermost pipe), and this cement failed and oil moved into that space from the reservoir. 2) Oil then entered the production casing (an inner pipe) although two barriers (one made of cement called a [...] "shoe track") were supposed to prevent this. 3) A test was conducted as to whether the well was sealed (a negative pressure test), conducted by temporarily replacing heavy drilling mud with lighter seawater. This is controlled unbalancing of the well. The test was considered successful, although it was not, since oil was actually moving out of the reservoir. The report names the Transocean rig crew and the BP staff on hand as having made this error. 4) When the test was completed, the seawater was replaced with mud, stopping the flow. But later, when preparing to temporarily shut down the well, mud was again replaced with seawater, allowing oil to flow up the riser toward the rig. This flow was detected by pressure sensors on the rig. The report blames the rig crew for missing the increased pressure readings. 5) When the flow was noticed, the crew activated the blowout preventer and diverted the oil to a mud separation system rather than diverting it into the ocean; diverting it into the ocean may have spared much of the damage. 6) The design of the mud separation system allowed the oil to keep coming and gas carried by the oil to be vented onto the rig. 7) The venting system allowed the gas to move into areas of the rig where it would be in contact with electrical equipment. 8) The blowout preventer failed in several ways; controls on the rig were disabled by the explosion; an <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> system within the blowout preventer failed, probably due to failure of two components - a solenoid and battery; when a submersible was able to activate a blind shear within the blowout preventer, the blind shear functioned but failed to seal the well. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed [...] "BP's fatally flawed well design." ...|$|E
50|$|On December 12, {{the second}} attempt {{to launch a}} {{complete}} Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. Their relief at having avoided certain disaster on December 12 was short-lived when the Titan exploded {{almost as soon as}} it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off, as Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile. Testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months. On February 2, 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on February 24, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8 due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting. On July 1, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved—it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.|$|E

40|$|The heating of {{companies}} premises is today functional with electrical heating and heating of fossil fuel. The energy cost for {{these kinds of}} heating in buildings has heavily increased during the last years and the influence on the environment has become more visual. This leads to that enterprises today become more anxious to render energy more effective and find alternative solutions to their ancient heating systems. This is something that Skandinaviska kraftprodukter AB in Halmstad has become aware of. The purpose with this examination is to find the most cost-efficient and environmental measures for the office and workshop premises of SKP AB. Where one of the bigger things is to find a good alternative for their current oil furnace, which was heating the workshop. Another big thing was to take forward suggestions for measures of rendering energy more effective for the buildings. By taking contact with people in the business and by inspecting the premises and the heating system, we got an idea about the measures that could be of current interest. We analysed these measures {{to see if they could}} last financially and environmentally. At the financial analysis we used LCC-method which means that you calculate the cost of the investment during its life. With the heating system this means, among other things, running, maintenance and initial costs. To examine the affect on the environment from the different heating alternatives we chose to make a easier LCA, which we based on the local conditions. In an existing building it is the simple measures of rendering energy that dominates financially, the bigger investments don’t create financial expectations high enough with the energy prices of today. In the workshop it was foremost a number of industrial gates that led to great heating losses, which would best be taken care off by PVC-stripes curtain or <b>automatic</b> <b>shutoff</b> of the heating system when the gates are open. Another alternative would be to invest in aircurtain. This would reduce the heating losses a lot, but because of the large investment cost is this not an option. The most cost-efficient measure is to increase the awareness of the employees, about how their behaviour is affecting the use of energy and to make sure that heat and ventilation doesn’t run unnecessarily. While going through possible heating alternatives for the workshop, three alternatives seemed the most interesting, air-to-air heat pump district heating and pellets. When it came to the financial aspects where there no great difference between the three alternatives, when you looked at a calculation period over 30 years. Environmentally heat pump was the best choice because the electricity of HEM is water produced. The district heating had the highest affect on the environment because it partially comes from waste burning, which leads to large emissions. From comfort and maintenance point of view we think that the district heating is the best alternative for the enterprise, foremost because you don’t have to maintain the system and it can heat the premises even during the coldest days. The downside with pellets is that it brings a curtain amount of maintenance and that pellets storage takes a lot of place. The downside of heat pump is that it doesn’t have enough effect to cope with the coldest days. Our recommendation of heating system is district heating. It is true it has the biggest influence on the environment but because it can handle the need for heat during all parts of the year and that it is free of maintenance ways up for its influence on the environment...|$|E
