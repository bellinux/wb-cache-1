5|$|The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000times larger. Jupiter's magnetic field rotates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed,</b> the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

50|$|Since emitter and {{detector}} {{are traveling}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speeds,</b> Doppler effects cancel out, so the Sagnac effect {{does not involve}} the Doppler effect. In the case of ring laser interferometry, {{it is important to}} be aware of this. When the ring laser setup is rotating, the counterpropagating beams undergo frequency shifts in opposite directions. This frequency shift is not a Doppler shift, but is rather an optical cavity resonance effect, as explained below in Ring lasers.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

25|$|Time is {{sometimes}} used (instead of angle) to express {{position within the}} cycle of an oscillation. A phase difference is analogous to two athletes running around a race track <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since they are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> {{and in the same}} direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the phase difference is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, phase difference between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.|$|E

40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 6 (1) : 43 - 51, 2013. In {{the sport}} of track and field, runners excel not only due to {{physiological}} characteristics but also aspects in running technique. Optimal technique allows runners the perfect the balance between running speed and economy. The ideal movement pattern may vary between events as the goal goes from economy of movement in the long-distance events to speed and power in the sprints. Understanding how each type of runner moves differently will help coaches more effectively train their athletes for each specific running event. This {{study was conducted to}} determine if sprinters, middle-distance, and long-distance runners would exhibit differences in form while running <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speeds.</b> Thirty female Division I collegiate runners participated in this study. Runners were separated into categories based on the events for which they were currently training in: 10 sprinters, 10 middle-distance, and 10 long-distance runners. Participants were asked to run twenty-two steps at five selected speeds. Knee angles, ground contact time, center of mass separation, and stride length were measured using a Vicon Nexus motion analysis system. Data was processed using analysis of variance and a Tukey post hoc analysis. Significant differences (p <. 05) occurred between long-distance runners and the other two groups (middle-distance and sprinters) for knee range, ground contact time, center of mass separation, and stride length at all five <b>speeds.</b> While running <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>speeds,</b> there are specific characteristics of technique that distinguish long-distance runners from middle-distance and sprinters...|$|R
