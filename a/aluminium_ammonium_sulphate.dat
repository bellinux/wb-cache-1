40|$|South African {{coal fly ash}} {{represents}} an untapped secondary resource of aluminium. Continuous research is conducted to develop suitable chemical and/or geometallurgical processes for aluminium extraction, preferably accompanied by minimal silicon extraction. The thermochemical treatment of a South African ultrafine coal fly ash was investigated to test the feasibility of recovering <b>aluminium</b> using <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> a widely available, low-cost, recyclable chemical agent. The optimum processing conditions were determined to be a temperature of 500 °C and a fly ash to <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> weight ratio of 2 : 6 when a reaction time of 1 h was used. Water leaching of the reaction product obtained under these conditions resulted in the selective recovery of 95. 0 % aluminium from the amorphous phase, with b 0. 6 % Si extracted. Mullite was unlikely to have reacted with the extracting agent. Except for Si, the process was not element-selective, but the extraction of iron could be minimized by increasing the treatment temperature to 600 °C without compromising Al extraction.

Results: In order to delay the sporulation different levels of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (10, 12 and 14 %) were added in culture media as nitrogen source for fungus.

40|$|In Japan, {{the amount}} of sulphate-ion applied to fields as an accompaniment of fertilizers, such as <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> calcium {{superphosphate}} and potassium sulphate has remarkably increased in recent years, {{and now we are}} apprehensive of the damage caused by the attack on rice root by free H_ 2 S produced by the reduction of such sulphates, especially in so-called "degradated paddy soils" Thus we made a study of the absorption of sulphate-ion by soils, the state of its leaching by pot experiments and the quantity of sulphate-ion accumulated in field soils by the application of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for long years, and we obtained the results such as follows. [I] Absorption of sulphate-ion: (1) When 10 g. soil with 100 cc of N/ 5 <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution was shaken, and after twenty-four hours the SO_ 4 content of the supernatant clear liquid was analysed, the decrease of SO_ 4 was confirmed, though the general opinion of present days is that the sulphate and chloride ions, unlike phosphate ion, are not adsorbed by soil colloids. Thus, it was known that the original and Na-oxalate-treated soil absorbed SO_ 4 fairly well, but the soil washed with N/ 5 HCl solution to eliminate Ca-ion, absorbed SO_ 1 insignificantly (Fig. 1). (2) When Ca-satulated clay which had been prepared by treating bentonite with calcium chloride solution was treated with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution by the same method as described above, it absorbed a large quantity of SO_ 4. However, Na-clay hardly absorbed it. On the otherhand, the absorption-curves of ammonium ion in these cases were almost the same (Fig. 2). (3) The amount of sulphate ion absorbed increased almost linearly when {{the amount of}} Ca-clay added increased, while it was not so with Na-clay, H-clay and K-clay. (4) It is clear that a part of the sulphate ion is temporarily preserved in soil by combining chemically with calcium, the percentage of preservation being greater in concentrated solution than in dilute solution. From this fact, it may be supposed {{that this is one of}} the factors which cause the preserved amount of sulphate ion to be greater in paddy fields where <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> has an opportunity of solving as comparatively concentrated solution than in ordinary farm fields. [II] Each 1 litre of penetrated water from pots of paddy state, fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> calcium superphosphate and potassium sulphate was analysed weekly as for the contents of sulphate, Ca, Fe, sulphide, free H_ 2 S etc., and the average results of two years (1951 - 1952) were as follows: (1) A greater part of sulphate leached within 45 or 50 days after the plantation of rice plant, and after that the remaining part went out slowly but steadily. The former seems to be a direct outgo from <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and potassium sulphate, whereas the latter is an outgo from Ca superphosphate applied. There was not a great difference between the leaching amounts of sulphate and chloride during the former period of growth. (2) The outgone amount of calcium was almost the same whether it might be added as sulphate or chloride, and in both cases a greater amount of calcium leached as compared with unfertilized plots. (3) The outgo of iron was greatly accelerated by the addition of sulphate, especially in planting plots during the latter period of growth. (4) The leaching amount of sulphide was extremely little as compared with the total amount of sulphates added, and the differences between the plots were not recongnized, except that the penetrating amount of sulphate plot was a little greater. [III] Soils fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for 5 to 57 years and unfertilized soils in the neighborhood were collected from different parts of Japan, and compared by chemical analysis, and the following results were obtained. (1) Soils fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for long years contained more sulphate when compared with unfertilized soils; the average difference being 0. 017 % in surface soil, 0. 012 % in subsoil of paddy soils and 0. 02 % in surface soil, 0. 34 % in subsoil of ordinary field soils. But the increased amount by long years fertilization with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was less than ten percents of total amount of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> fertilized during respective period. (2) Soils fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> had lower Ca content and pH value, larger total acidity and lower degree of base saturation as compared with unfertilized soils and the difference is especially significant in ordinary field soils as it is naturally expected. (3) The free iron content of soils fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was comparatively small, especially in paddy field soils. (4) Humus contents are generally higher in soils fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as compared with unfertilized soils. This is considered to be a result of the fact that the growth of crops was better in the plots fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> than unfertilized plots accordingly the organic matter that remained in soils was greater in the former plots than in the latter ones. If the plots fertilized with N without sulphate were arranged, the humus contents of the plots might be higher like those of plots fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> because the leaching of Ca and Fe might be violent in the latter soils...|$|R

40|$|Gemcitabine, an anticancer agent, is {{currently}} in clinical use {{for the treatment of}} several types of cancer. Unfortunately, gemcitabine is rapidly metabolised with a short plasma half-life and its cytostatic action is strongly exposure-time dependent. In order to achieve the required concentration over sufficient periods of time, repeated application of relatively high doses is required. This, in turn, leads to dose-limiting systemic toxicity. In order to improve both the efficiency and the toxicity profile of gemcitabine the use of liposomes appears promising. In literature, only a few attempts to entrap gemcitabine within liposomes are found, however none of these liposomal formulations has reached clinical practice. In this study, an <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> gradient was tried for active loading of gemcitabine into liposomes. Firstly, unsaturated egg phosphatidyl choline liposome dispersion was prepared with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as hydration medium by the hand shaken method followed by filter extrusions with decreasing filter sizes down to 0. 1 µm. Then, a transmembrane <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> gradient was generated by removing extra-liposomal <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> by size exclusion chromatography. Quantitative determination of the <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> concentration, both outside and inside the liposomes, via electric conductivity measurement revealed that a gradient of external to internal <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> of about 1 : 58 was achieved. Secondly, the liposomes were loaded with gemcitabine by incubation at different conditions. Among the loading conditions tested, a total loading time of 24 hours including heating for 2 hours at 60 ˚C seemed advantageous in achieving efficient loading. A higher starting concentration of gemcitabine resulted in enhanced loading efficiency, calculated on a molar basis. Comparing these results to a VPG passive loading technique, the active loading technique resulted in a gemcitabine:lipid ratio of about 1 : 20 versus 1 : 140 for the vesicular phospholipid gel loaded liposomes. Unfortunately, the actively loaded liposomes revealed poor storage stability with 80 % leakage after 24 hours.
