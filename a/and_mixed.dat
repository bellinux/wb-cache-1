40|$|After a brief {{historical}} {{review of}} ergodicity <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> in dynamics, particularly in quantum dynamics, we introduce definitions of quantum ergodicity <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> using {{the structure of}} the system's energy levels and spacings. Our definitions are consistent with usual understanding of ergodicity <b>and</b> <b>mixing.</b> Two parameters concerning the degeneracy in energy levels and spacings are introduced. They are computed for right triangular billiards and the results indicate a very close relation between quantum ergodicity (<b>mixing)</b> <b>and</b> quantum chaos. At the end, we argue that, besides ergodicity <b>and</b> <b>mixing,</b> there may exist a third class of quantum dynamics which is characterized by a maximized entropy.

40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} is to posit some points {{touching}} the use of Code-switching <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> of English <b>and</b> Arabic. The objectives of this study were to show 1 - whether Arab students at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) code-switch <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> to English in their daily contacts or not, 2 - why Arab students at AMU code switch <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> to English. This investigation was conducted on the 19 th of january, 2015. It investigated 100 Arab students of different educational levels,nationalities and ages, they are at 3 levels of education:Bachelors, Masters, and Ph. D. at AMU. The tool used for data collection in this study was a questionnaire. The result have shown that most of Arab students at AMU do code-switch <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> to English in their conversations. Finally, the findings show that the reasons Arab students at AMU code-switch <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> to English refer to the lack of knowledge in English...|$|R
