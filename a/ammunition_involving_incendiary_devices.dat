5000|$|The KgU's [...] "dumb scheme", {{intending}} to use poison in their struggle, gave the group a [...] "poison problem" [...] that would haunt them. Plans, {{which came out}} at the Kaiser and Burianek trials, <b>involving</b> <b>incendiary</b> <b>devices</b> and suitcase bombs were one thing; but by concentrating {{the attention of the}} court (and of those reporting it) on the possible uses of Kaiser's 25gm of nerve agent, the East German Prosecutor was able to destroy sympathy and trust for the KgU, on account of the resistance tactics they were evidently willing to contemplate, across western public opinion. East German propaganda used these high-profile show trials to criminalize all sorts of opposition: the US Intelligence services were always behind the conspiracies [...] "proven".|$|R
5000|$|Firebombing is a {{technique}} designed to damage a target, generally an urban area, {{through the use of}} fire, caused by <b>incendiary</b> <b>devices,</b> rather than from the blast effect of large bombs.

The high explosive destroys roofs, making it easier for the <b>incendiary</b> <b>devices</b> to penetrate the structures and cause fires. The high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters [...] to douse the fires.|$|R
