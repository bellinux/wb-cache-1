40|$|The {{relationship}} between stress and road safety {{has been studied}} for many years, but the effect of global stress and its joint effect with personality on driving behavior have received little attention in previous studies. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of global stress and various personality traits on driving behavior. 242 drivers completed the Perceived Stress Scale- 10 (PSS- 10), the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI), and several personality trait scales related to anger, sensation seeking, and altruism. The results showed that perceived stress and sensation seeking were significantly correlated with the four subcategories of dangerous driving behavior, namely, negative cognitive/emotional driving (NCED), aggressive driving (AD), risky <b>driving</b> (RD), <b>and</b> drunk <b>driving</b> (DD). Moreover, anger {{was positively correlated with}} negative cognitive/emotional <b>driving,</b> aggressive <b>driving,</b> <b>and</b> risky <b>driving,</b> <b>and</b> altruism was negatively correlated with aggressive <b>driving</b> <b>and</b> drunk <b>driving.</b> Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to analyze the mediating effect of personality traits, and the results showed that anger mediated the {{relationship between}} stress <b>and</b> dangerous <b>driving</b> behavior <b>and</b> that this mediating role was especially strong for negative cognitive/emotional <b>driving</b> <b>and</b> aggressive <b>driving.</b> Collectively, the results showed that stress is an important factor that can affect people&# 39;s driving behavior but that personality traits mediate the effect of stress on driving behavior. The findings from this study regarding the relationship among stress, anger, <b>and</b> dangerous <b>driving</b> behavior could be applied in the development of intervention programs for stress and anger management in order to improve drivers&# 39; ability to manage emotional thoughts and adjust their behavior on the road.

40|$|Sleepy <b>driving</b> <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> are two {{risky driving}} {{behaviours}} that substantially contribute to road crashes. Several studies demonstrate equivalent levels of impairment from both sleepy <b>and</b> drink <b>driving.</b> Yet, drivers perceive sleepy <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> distinctly different, with {{younger and older}} drivers engaging in these two risky driving behaviours at different rates. The current study sought to examine the sleepy <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> behaviours <b>and</b> perceptions {{in a sample of}} 114 younger (17 - 29 years) and 177 older (30 + years) drivers. Compared to older drivers, younger drivers reported more positive attitudes toward sleepy <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> behaviours, as well as more negative views regarding perceived legitimacy of sleepy driving enforcement. Younger drivers {{were also more likely to}} report performing sleepy driving behaviours than older drivers. Younger drivers reported greater likelihood to drive while sleepy, lower perceptions of legitimacy for sleepy <b>driving,</b> <b>and</b> more positive attitudes towards sleepy driving when compared to drink <b>driving</b> <b>and</b> the same pattern was found for older drivers as well. Subsequently, the self-reported likelihood of driving while sleepy was greater than drink driving in both age groups. Overall, the results suggest that sleepy driving is not viewed as equally dangerous as drink driving with younger drivers’ perceptions being more lenient than older drivers’ perceptions. It is likely that change is needed regarding the perceptions of dangerousness of sleepy driving with a particular focus on younger drivers seemingly needed...|$|R
