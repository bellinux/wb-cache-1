5000|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja hyperborea) is {{a species}} of fish in Rajidae family. It lives near the seabed between 140 and 2,500 metres in the Arctic ocean and waters around Canada and Northern and North-West Europe, in {{northern}} Pacific ocean and in waters surrounding Antarctica and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> {{is about}} a metre long and is gray-brown with large dark spots. Its {{underside}} is white with dark patterns. It has thorns in line from back to {{near the end of}} its tail. It is oviparous; its eggs are capsules with hard horns on each corner. It eats all sorts of small animals {{at the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of skates (Rajidae) in the by-catch of trawl and long-line fisheries in the Barents Sea are described. The dominant species captured were thorny skate or starry ray (Amblyraja radi-ate), <b>arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (A. hyperborea) and round skate (Rajella fyllae), whereas blue or big skate (Dipturus batis) and sail ray (D. linteus) were only caught occasionally. Information {{on the size}} distribution and sex ratio are provided. Larger skates were more often caught in long-line fisheries, with the mean and maximum length of fish greater in long-line catches, particularly for the larger-bodied species. Ratio of males to females was close to 1 : 1 in all species except for <b>arctic</b> <b>skate</b> where males dominated in the long-line fishery. Preliminary estimates of skate by-catch in these fisheries indicate that total annual by-catch of skate in the Barents Sea ranges from 723 – 1 891 tons. Thorny skate accounted for 90 – 95 % of the total skate catch...|$|E

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} {{data were}} used to investigate spatial, seasonal and inter-annual patterns of feeding of the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) in the Barents Sea during 1994 – 2000. The diets and food consumption by the thorny skate of different size groups were analyzed and assessed with special reference to the consumption of commercial species of fishes and crustaceans. Less comprehensive data on food composition are presented for other less abundant Barents Sea skates: <b>arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (A. hyperborea), round skate (Rajella fyllae), blue skate (Dipturus batis), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and sail ray (D. linteus) ...|$|E
40|$|Given {{concerns}} {{about climate change}} and exploitation of Arctic marine resources, {{it is critical to}} elucidate the movements of deep-water Arctic marine species. This thesis analysed data from pop-off archival transmitting tags deployed on commercially exploited Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and a bycatch species <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja hyperborea) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut tagged in August 2010 - 2011. Data collected for 40 - 300 days defined the preferred depth and temperature ranges for halibut (800 - 1300 m, 1. 5 - 2. 5 °C) and skates (500 - 1300 m, 1. 5 - 3. 0 °C) and suggested differences in activity levels and behaviour. Greenland halibut were more sedentary compared to more active skates and displayed high site fidelity with no evidence for diel vertical migration, though they undertook seasonal movements to shallow water. The profiles of the active, relatively fast-swimming skates indicated that they may switch between benthic and pelagic foraging modes. Both species overlapped in spatial habitat use. This information will contribute to regional species-specific fisheries management plans...|$|E

40|$|Cartilaginous {{fish are}} very ancient organisms. In the Antarctic sea, the modern chondrichthyan genera are poorly represented, {{with only three}} species of sharks and eight species of skates; the paucity of chondrichthyans is {{probably}} an ecological consequence of unusual trophic or habitat conditions in the Southern Ocean. In the Arctic, there are 26 species belonging to the class Chondrichthyes. Fish in the two polar regions {{have been subjected to}} different regional histories that have influenced the development of diversity: Antarctic marine organisms are highly stenothermal, in response to stable water temperatures, whereas the Arctic communities are exposed to seasonal temperature variations. The structure and function of the oxygen-transport haem protein from the Antarctic skate Bathyraja eatonii and from the <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> Raja hyperborea (both of the subclass Elasmobranchii, order Rajiformes, family Rajidae) is reported in the present paper. These species have a single major haemoglobin (Hb 1; over 80 % of the total). The Bohr-proton and the organophosphate-binding sites are absent. Thus the haemoglobins of northern and southern polar skates appear functionally similar, whereas differences were observed with several temperate elasmobranchs. Such evidence suggests that, in temperate and polar habitats, physiological adaptations have evolved along distinct pathways, whereas, in this case, the effect of the differences characterizing the two polar environments is negligible...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five skate species- thorny (Amblyraja radiata), Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for thorny and Arctic skates were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for smooth skate. Round skate has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate.</b> Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. Thorny skate showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and round skate did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO. Thorny skate appear as dominant predator in NAFO Div. 3 NO...|$|E
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 – 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine {{patterns on the}} South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), <b>Arctic</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
