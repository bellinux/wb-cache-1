For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric blender or food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a serving platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> top.

Then, a Green’s function solution for multilayered solids is obtained by solving a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations using both the boundary conditions for the singularity and the layer interfaces.

At the lowest temperatures the quasiparticle mean free path exceeds 50 micron, a record for a compound superconductor.

At the Fraunhofer IOSB a new measuring system has been developed which allows the application of imaging ellipsometry on curved surfaces.

Several problems arise when interpreting the ellipsometry measurements from the new measurement system, like unknown angle of incidence, few measurements per pixel and often unknown materials.

We also describe how missing boundary points are approximated using band-limited interpolation so that the FFT can be applied.

40|$|Abstract: Residual stress-induced {{deformations}} are a {{major cause}} of tolerance loss in solid freeform fabrication process employing direct metal deposition. In this article, a three-dimensional finite-element (FE) thermo-mechanical model is presented to predict the residual stress-induced deformations with application to processes where material is added using a dis-tributed moving heat source, e. g. gas metal arc welding (GMAW). A sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical analysis is performed simulating buildup of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> a bolted rec-tangular substrate. The material {{used in the present study}} is mild steel, with temperature-dependent material properties and the material modelled as elastic perfectly plastic. The numerical results are compared with experimental data by manufacturing plate-shaped single-layered specimen, using an indigenously developed semi-automatic deposition system. The fusion zone and temperatures predicted by numerical model show good agreement with experimental data, and the deformations of the substrate in bolted and unbolted conditions are also in good agreement. It has been observed that the heat transfer conditions vary during deposition; therefore, any assumption of thermal symmetry is not valid. Thermal cycling during deposition is the main cause of deformations. The effect of bolting is also very important...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{achieved}} {{two types}} of laser emissions from aqueous quantum dots (QDs) using the same high-Q-factor optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) platform. In the first type, 2 μM QDs were in bulk buffer solution that filled the entire OFRR cavity volume. The lasing threshold was 0. 1 μJ/mm 2, over 3 orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. In {{the second type of}} laser, the QDs were immobilized as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> the interface between the OFRR inner wall and buffer solution with a surface density as low as 3 × 109 − 1010 cm− 2. The lasing threshold of 60 μJ/mm 2 was achieved. In both bulk solution and single-layer lasing cases, the laser emission persisted even under 5 − 10 min of uninterrupted pulsed optical excitation that was well above the corresponding lasing threshold, indicative of high photostability of the QD laser. This was in sharp contrast to organic-dye-based lasers, which underwent quick photobleaching during the laser operation under similar pumping conditions. Theoretical analysis is also carried out to elucidate the advantages of QD-based optofluidic lasers over those based on dyes. Our work opens the door to a plethora of applications where optofluidic QD lasers can replace dye-based optofluidic lasers in biosensing and on-chip miniaturized laser development...|$|E

40|$|The endothelial {{cells of}} vessels, the {{interstitial}} matrix {{and the distance}} between the tumor cells and vessels, are the major penetration barriers for intravenously administered anticancer drugs in reaching tumor cells after intravenous injection. The availability of a tumor tissue-mimicking model that includes both the endothelial cell layer and the extracellular matrix would be beneficial to assess drug penetration in early stages of drug development. Here, we propose a novel in vitro model for studying the above mentioned barriers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> a collagen type-I coated permeable cell culture insert. After culturing for five days, the insert was superimposed on collagen type-I gel containing cancer cells. The system was evaluated for assessing penetration-enhancement by ultrasound triggered microbubble cavitation. Our model allowed visualization of the penetration distance of a model drug (fluorescein isothiocyanate - Dextran 500000 -conjugated, FD 500) from the endothelial cell layer into the cancer cell containing collagen matrix upon different sonication treatments. Initial results showed that the model allows the visualization of drug penetration and that the endothelial cell layer is affecting this. The presented in vitro model aims to mimic vessels and stromal tissue in cancer, and thus can aid in the assessment of drug penetration in the case of tumor-targeted drug delivery, and in the reduction and refinement of animal studies.
