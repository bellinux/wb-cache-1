5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> is costly to trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E

50|$|In {{the upper}} {{middle of the}} shield, below the row of krises, are the colours of the Federated Malay States (red, black, white <b>and</b> <b>yellow)</b> {{arranged}} from left to right. The permutations of the colours red, black, white <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> make up the colours of these states' flags. Red, black <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> are for Negeri Sembilan; black and white for Pahang; black, white <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> for Perak; <b>and</b> red <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> for Selangor.|$|R

5|$|The {{chemical}} analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles {{has rarely been}} conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected {{it is impossible to}} determine which of several indigo-bearing plants was used. Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
25|$|The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as {{the first}} green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest as she waited in happy {{anticipation}} for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not {{come back to the}} land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and listless, she wandered through the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is an oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring 170 by 141cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a Divisionist style, with pointillist dots of color. The work {{is dominated by}} a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of earth tones that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds <b>and</b> <b>yellows),</b> nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any {{of which could be}} mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted {{around the edge of the}} canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in a bottle green <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> whiskers livery with red cowcatchers. Beginning c. 1960, a Gulf Red <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> whiskers livery gradually replaced the green <b>and</b> <b>yellow.</b>|$|R

25|$|Clothes Peg Figures: {{were named}} by Walsh after their {{resemblance}} to old wooden clothes pegs, {{but they are}} also referred to as Straight Part Figures by Welch. These figures are depicted in a stationary pose and painted with red pigment. Segments of their bodies are missing, such as their waists, arms and feet, the result of different colour pigments, such as whites <b>and</b> <b>yellows,</b> fading over time. The material culture depicted with these figures includes multi-barbed spears, spear-throwers, and woven bags. This is the most recent style. The anatomical detail common in the earlier styles is missing, and many of the images are shown in aggressive stances. At least one panel shows a battle with opponents arrayed in ranks opposite each other.|$|E
500|$|Dyes {{that create}} reds <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> can also yield oranges. Navajo dyers create orange dyes from [...] one-seeded juniper, Juniperus monosperma, Navajo tea, Thelesperma gracile, or alder bark.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, Edinburgh Corporation, LRT and Lothian Buses had a livery of madder (a dark red) {{and white}} or cream, with {{matching}} madder leatherette seating. Some coach-seated Alexander RH bodied Leyland Olympians and Alexander Royale bodied Volvo Olympians were painted with red {{in place of}} the madder. When low floor disabled access vehicles were introduced in the late 1990s, they were given their own distinguishing [...] "harlequin" [...] livery. A tartan pattern was used on seat upholstry at this time, and the insides of the buses were coloured in bright blues <b>and</b> <b>yellows.</b> The last high step bus was removed from service by Lothian in the late 2000s, making the distinction irrelevant.|$|E

500|$|Potter {{declared}} the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures {{are some of}} the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the profusions of flowers in the doorways and garden plots. [...] The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|E
500|$|The Apostle {{garden is}} aligned {{on the front}} door in the East front of the house and a {{building}} which {{has been described as a}} water tower, built by the Jenners in imitation of the dovecote at Avebury Manor, which was wrongly identified as a Dovecote by English Heritage. The garden is a severe, formal approach, flanked by topiarised yews, and is [...] "deliberately low-key and simple so as not to distract from the beauty of the building". The main border is [...] long and at its best in midsummer. The flowers grade from blues <b>and</b> <b>yellows,</b> through creams and apricots to pinks, mauves and reds. There is a restful White Garden beyond for contrast.|$|E
500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} June olives with their blue-green color and coolness of tone, the vibrant oranges <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> in Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun (F710) evoke the fall season. [...] Novelist Warren Keith Wright visited this {{painting}} at the Minneapolis Institute of Art over a 15-year period, {{transfixed by the}} painting, but unsure why. [...] He {{came to realize that}} the fascination was that the painting represented two periods of time. [...] The late-afternoon sun lies due west above the mountains. [...] The shadows, though, slant from the left, or the southwest, where they would fall in autumn. [...] Not only is the painting out of sync with time, it is also out of sync with the season. [...] It [...] "predicts its own future, reverts to its own past." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the {{ultramarine}} blues <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italy’s Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He {{had always wanted to}} walk in the steps of the masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. He gave it to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked him to show it to Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco. Bredius examined the forgery in September 1937 and he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it highly.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the palace received no less attention to detail and design than the exterior. French artisans were employed to decorate the rooms, {{many of which are}} small, their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and historical scenes. Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors, for a [...] appearance as well as coolness in hot weather. The many tall pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms. A predominant feature of the interiors is the azulejos: polychrome glazed tiles, often in a chinoiserie style with tones of blues <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> contrasting with muted reds. Materials for use on the interior included stone imported from Genoa and woods from Brazil, Denmark and Sweden, while coloured marbles were imported from Italy. Many of the palace's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934, and much was lost.|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though his palette was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this story out of where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y looks that didn’t feel right", before settling on tracksuits with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange tracksuits include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E

5000|$|Red, <b>yellow,</b> <b>and</b> blue are {{the primary}} colors of the {{standard}} color [...] "wheel". The secondary colors, violet (or purple), orange, and green (VOG) make up another triad, formed by mixing equal amounts of red and blue, red <b>and</b> <b>yellow,</b> <b>and</b> blue <b>and</b> <b>yellow,</b> respectively.|$|R

2500|$|The {{turquoise}} {{occurs as}} vein or seam fillings, and as compact nuggets; these are mostly small in size. While quite fine material is sometimes found—rivalling Iranian material in both colour and durability—most American turquoise is {{of a low}} grade (called [...] "chalk turquoise"); high iron levels mean greens <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> predominate, and a typically friable consistency in the turquoise's untreated state precludes use in jewellery.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the series}} was painted on 18 October 1937, and is oil on canvas, 55 {{centimetres}} by 46 centimetres. While the painting in the Tate is in bright reds, blues <b>and</b> <b>yellows,</b> the 18 October work {{has been described as}} [...] "an unsettling combination of acid greens and vibrant mauves exaggerated by thick black outlines". This is the painting that was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1985 for [...]|$|E
2500|$|During a {{campaign}} speech in 2017, Moore decried racial divisions plaguing the United States, and stating: [...] "Now we have {{blacks and whites}} fighting, reds <b>and</b> <b>yellows</b> fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What’s going to unite us? What’s going to bring us back together? Apresident? A Congress? No. It's going to be God." [...] Moore's reference to [...] "reds" [...] and [...] "yellows" [...] was criticized as racially insensitive. Moore's campaign responded by stating that Moore's statement was a paraphrase of the children's Sunday School song [...] "Jesus Loves the Little Children" [...] and was an appeal for racial healing.|$|E
