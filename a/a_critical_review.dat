40|$|This paper {{explains}} the legal <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> in the <b>critical</b> {{context of the}} logic of scholarship. The paper asks what makes <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> effective in research. It suggests that <b>critical</b> literature <b>reviews</b> are effective in research when they more easily allow the identification of research gaps, in the specified context. The methodology employs cumulative synthesis from the relevant materials, following Bentham’s ideas on synthesis, that analysis opposes both generalization and synthesis. The paper begins its argument by outlining the nature of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review.</b> Then, it proceeds with a review of key terms required by the writer. Following this essential background, the paper discusses literature gaps and literature search methodologies. Then it moves on to the ideal format of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review.</b> Finally, argument deals {{with the purpose of}} <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> and techniques for writing the <b>critical</b> literature <b>review.</b> <b>A</b> legal <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> will be maximally effective when it sets a correct context for research, identifies fallacies in the scholarship in order to discover research gaps, and then forms this outcome into a central research question...|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> {{of ancient}} DNA {{literature}} {{through the development}} of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years. A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results. The dinosaur DNA was later revealed to be human Y-chromosome, while the DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination. A 2007 study also suggests that these bacterial DNA samples may not have survived from ancient times, but may instead be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.|$|E

25|$|In 1838 Parker {{published}} {{his first major}} article, <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of an orthodox work written by his former professor John Gorham Palfrey. In it Parker broke {{for the first time}} with supernatural realism, as he also increasingly did in his sermons. To him, Christianity was natural rather than miraculous. More and more, he praised social reform movements such as those for temperance, peace, and the abolition of slavery. In 1840 he described such movements as divinely inspired, though he added that they did not fully address the spiritual and intellectual ills of society. Controversy mounted regarding these and other Transcendentalist elements in his work. So did criticism, which often saddened and distressed him.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, Pantazi Ghica joined Dimitrie Bolintineanu in editing {{the journal}} Dâmboviţa, but, {{just a year}} later, his {{articles}} were {{the subject of a}} scandal, and he was arrested for allegedly breaking the ethics of journalism. He shared a cell with his colleague, N. T. Orăşanu, a noted adversary of Carol's rule. He was also an associate of the writer Alexandru Odobescu, and, after 1861, collaborated on his monthly literary magazine Revista Română. It was here that he published <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of Ciocoii vechi şi noi, a novel by his friend Nicolae Filimon, which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured). For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, Păcală (named in honor of the eponymous folk hero) and Scrânciobul.|$|E
25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an action learning orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E

In <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> for The Observer Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality. In a review for Empire magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded; he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough. In Time Out London David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship. <b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> by Noah Sanders of The Stranger concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized. The St. Paul Pioneer Press criticized the film's length, which was echoed by The Washington Post, the Deseret News, The Herald and the New York Daily News. In a review for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech. Mike Pinksy of DVD Verdict concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved {{by the beginning of the}} documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.|$|E
