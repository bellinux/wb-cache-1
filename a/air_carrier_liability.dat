40|$|This Note {{examines}} recent {{attempts to}} resolve over sixty years {{of criticism of}} the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s liability limits. Part I discusses the Warsaw Convention, the international community 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to expand the liability provisions of the Warsaw Convention, and judicial treatment of the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s liability limits in the United States. Part II describes recent proposals {{to resolve the issue}} of liability limits, including the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the DOT 2 ̆ 7 s proposed conditions to the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the EC Proposal on <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability,</b> and the ICAO 2 ̆ 7 s draft of a new international convention. Part III argues that the IATA Intercarrier Agreement does not eliminate the need to amend the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s liability provisions because contractual agreements such as the IATA Intercarrier Agreement cannot achieve the dual goals of uniform liability limits and systematic legal procedures foreseen by the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s drafters. This Note concludes that global adoption of a new international convention is the best means of regulating <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> given the complexities of the worldwide aviation industry today...|$|E

40|$|The Matter of <b>Air</b> <b>Carrier’s</b> <b>Liability</b> Insurance {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems in Air Transportation in Indonesia, because the <b>air</b> <b>carrier’s</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is in relation with <b>liability</b> of the <b>carrier.</b> <b>Liability</b> is clearly a risk, that is to say a financial risk. The risk is being under the legal obligation to pay compensation to others for damages suffered as a consequence of our acts. For that, in Indonesia, the obligation of the <b>carrier</b> for his <b>liability</b> insurances is regulated in Article 179 and Article 180 of Law Number 1 Year 2009 concerning Aviation (“Law No. 1 / 2009 ”), which is subsequently implemented in Article 16 and Article 17 of Regulation of Minister of Transportation Number 77 Year 2011 concerning <b>Air</b> <b>Carrier’s</b> <b>Liability</b> (“PM No. 77 / 2011 ”). Sanction for Air Transportation Company that does not insure its liability is provided in Article 26 and Article 27 PM No. 77 / 2011. However, until the date of this paper, the Standard Operating procedure (SOP) of PM No. 77 / 2011 is not available yet, so that Article 179 of Law No. 1 / 2009 is not applicable yet...|$|R

40|$|This {{abstract}} {{is written}} on the 11 th of September 2006 [...] -the fifth anniversary of the 9 / 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda. These attacks are taken to be {{a turning point in}} the relationship between Islam and the West. For the author, these attacks, the overwhelming counter-attacks by some of the western states on some Islamic states, as well as the endless Palestinian-Israeli disputes, are the result of misunderstanding and misconceptions that Islam and the West have of each other. While politics and politicians are destroying means of communication amongst these nations by the creation of such a state of war, scholars should exert their best efforts to build bridges of understanding and tolerance. This thesis is but a single brick in the much needed bridge of communication and understanding between the great civilisations of west and east. It seeks to show how the world's various legal traditions can benefit from each other. It attempts to do so by introducing the Islamic system of diyah and showing how it can interplay with and impact on the interpretation of international law. The example chosen is the existing set of <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> conventions. 9 / 11 reminds us that attacks on air transport have been a chosen means of sowing conflict. Yet peaceful use of air transport is among the most practical ties that bind the world together. <b>Air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> conventions render international air transport possible. The thesis shows how Islamic diyah can productively interact with these conventions. It can act as a median point at which the two extremes of the Warsaw System prescribing limited liability and the Montreal Convention prescribing unlimited liability can meet. The thesis shows as well how diyah can provide a useful methodology for integrating air carrier contractual and extra-contractual liability regimes. To assist the reader unfamiliar with Islamic-fiqh, the thesis it is divided into two parts. The first is devoted to an introduction to Islamic-fiqh, and the second treats the interaction of diyah with the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> conventions...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{hitherto}} unsettled {{political and}} legal status of Taiwan, air transportation between Taiwan and Mainland China has experienced tremendous growth since 1987. To date, this air transport has been effected {{through the use of}} an intermediate stop station in Hong Kong, in order that both States may avoid the recognition of the other as the legitimate "Chinese Government". However, Hong Kong will revert to the PRC in 1997. As a result, the issue of nonstop flights between Taiwan and the Mainland takes on an added urgency. This issue is not merely political. In terms of <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability,</b> Taiwan is party to the Warsaw Convention and the Warsaw Convention as Amended by the Hague Protocol, only through its tenuous link with Mainland China. Is the Convention applicable to Taiwan in this case? A number of arguments favoring applicability of the Convention are discussed and found to be wanting. In the alternative, the principle of conflict of laws is proposed as an applicable solution. Since Taiwan and the PRC have a civil law system while Hong Kong has a common law system, the respective legal regulations governing damage compensation in aviation cases differ. The case of liability following a hijacking is used to demonstrate how regulations of the three jurisdictions differ significantly. This leads to a serious problem, namely, "forum shopping". The fact that judicial assistance is not yet practiced between the three jurisdictions creates a further problem in that decisions coming from the different courts cannot be recognized and enforced in the other jurisdictions. In light of all of the foregoing, the existing legal systems cannot adequately address the legal problems of <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> in this region. As a result of these inadequacies, an alternative mechanism for resolving the issue of air carriers' liability is suggested. This suggested pragmatic approach may also be found applicable for updating existing air transport legal systems elsewhere in the world...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wave}} of growing {{consumer}} demand for global air travel, one can observe how domestic and international regulation of certain market aspects of aviation has not always developed {{in the same direction}} or at the same speed; this purports to challenge orderly progress of international law. Different legal frameworks, legal and political ideologies and respective realities have influenced the development of, for instance, multi-level regulation of aspects of civil aviation vis-à-vis consumer protection and limited liability regimes. Such developments are reflected in the most recent progress at the international level, following the adoption by the International Civil Aviation Organization of core principles on consumer protection for air passengers. This article provides an exposé on the increasingly contentious area of divergent approaches for the development of consumer protection initiatives, focusing on what are air passenger rights and how the impetus to provide them uniformly has risen up the agenda of the international aviation community. The article considers existing international law on <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability,</b> and the EU and US air passenger rights regimes, before locating the new core principles, to determine alignment of the existing systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis deals {{primarily}} with the <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> {{in the case}} of passenger death or bodily injury under Warsaw System. It analyzes the problems of today and tries to offer solutions for the present crisis of the Warsaw System for the future. The first chapter concentrates on an brief introduction of the development of the Warsaw System from the original Warsaw Convention, to the 1996 ICAO new draft instrument. The chapter gives the trend of development and explains the different characteristics of each Warsaw instrument. The second chapter analyses the shortcomings of the original Warsaw Convention by comparing the rationales of the <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> limited <b>liability</b> in 1929 and the requirements of today. In this way, this thesis seeks to present the limited <b>liability</b> of <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> as unreasonable and out of date. In order to offer the suggestions and possible solutions for the future, the third chapter analyses the merits and shortcomings of the Warsaw Instruments, unilateral or group action, the ECAC recommendation, the IATA Intercarrier Agreement and its implementing Agreement, and the ICAO new draft instrument. Finally, for the integrity of the <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability,</b> this thesis also briefly criticizes the shortcomings of baggage liability under the present Warsaw System and offers a better solution for baggage liability in the future. In the last chapter, the author introduces the related legal regime of the Republic of China, compares it with the Warsaw System and attempts to develop a method to link the Republic of China with the rest of world in the field of private air law...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} topical issues of {{international}} air law, namely international regulation of <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> in carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. The first multilateral treaty to consider and unify this topic was the Warsaw Convention in 1929. It prescribed the main {{requirements of the}} documents of carriage, i. e. the passenger ticket, the baggage check and the air waybill. In particular, the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> is liable for personal injury or death of passengers, loss or damage of baggage or cargo and for damage resulting from delay. The key points of the liability regime governed by the Warsaw Convention are presumptive liability and the maximum liability limits expressed in French Gold Francs. Due to the subsequent development of air transport these rules had to be modernized. The Warsaw Convention was amended with several Protocols and a Supplementary Convention, which together create the so-called "Warsaw system". The purpose of these documents was, amongst other things, to tighten up the liability regime while trying to establish strict liability and raise the liability limits. In 1999 a further unification of <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> took place {{with the creation of}} the Montreal Convention. Although it adopted some key liability provisions from previous documents, it stipulated [...] ...|$|R

40|$|At present {{there are}} several {{instruments}} that regulate air carrier's liability in international transportation. These international treaties are collectively known as the Warsaw System. Unfortunately, not all States are parties to the same instruments. In this thesis, four possibilities will be introduced for amendment of the System. These possibilities are as follows: ratification of the Guatemala City Protocol through the Montreal Protocol No. 3, an international treaty instrument, meant to update and amend the whole Warsaw System; the Italian solution, a national "remedy" taken without international consultations; the Japanese action, Japanese air carriers have waived entirely the Warsaw System's limits of liability; and finally, a recommendation to the EC Commission on a regional remedy {{in the form of}} a multilateral agreement where carriers raise the liability limits but otherwise the Warsaw provisions apply. Each possibility will be thoroughly examined in order to determine whether it is the best solution to the present crisis that the System is facing. At the end of this thesis one solution will be recommended for Iceland and other States to update the System. Other solutions are available but will not be discussed since they are not considered desirable for the aim of unification of air carrier's liability in international air carriage. What must be kept in mind when the four possibilities are being examined is that the aim of this thesis is to find a solution that unifies the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> regime and sometimes, in order to reach a uniform solution, a compromise must be reached.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of air passenger rights regimes around the globe, {{at least half}} of which were introduced in the past seven years, presents a real challenge for many stakeholders in air transport. On the one hand, national rules often vary from state to state; they overlap and are often complex or conflicting, which can be seen as creating rather ambiguous liability for the air transport sector, in particular for airlines and airports. On the other hand, the inherent nature of air transport is that it is international. A passenger holding a common itinerary may have rights under one or more air passenger rights regimes during his or her journey. If the travel does not go exactly as planned, attempts by the affected passenger to acquire information about, understand and enforce his or her consumer rights may prove onerous. National authorities could also fail to provide adequate complaint handling and compliance checking procedures. What results ultimately {{flies in the face of}} the purported aims of national and regional regimes, which surely is to provide consumer protection. This comment identifies recent developments at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency, within the sphere of consumer protection for air transport. The current state of affairs is considered alongside discussion on certain aspects of the current air passenger rights in the European Union (EU) and the limited <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>liability</b> regime of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (‘Montreal Convention’) 1999, and the issues that arise with respect to interpretation and application of the law. The following reveals the significance of the intersection of consumer protection for passengers at national and regional levels, and limited liability for airlines at international law, that has given rise to a recent call for global order vis-à-vis core principles on air passenger rights at international law...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} those issues in {{regulation}} of international air carriage, {{which are in}} the centre of interest of passengers. Author focuses on two key legal instruments establishing different regimes of <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability.</b> The first one is the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, {{also known as the}} Montreal Convention. The second is European regulation no. 261 / 2004, also known as the Air Passengers' Rights Regulation. The key question is whether these liability regimes are completely separate or they overlap. After introductory chapter, Chapter 2 follows, dealing with historical development of legal regulation in the field of air carriage liability. Evolution of the so called Warsaw system is described and the Montreal Convention and {{some of the most important}} European regulations are presented. Next chapter focuses on theoretical aspects of <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> in the light of Czech civil law jurisprudence. These findings are applied both to the Montreal Convention and to the regulation no. 261 / 2004. Provisions of the Montreal Convention are examined in Chapter 4.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the legal aspects of aviation {{insurance and reinsurance}} regarding passenger liability, in particular in Europe. The paper identifies and describes four main trends currently affecting the aviation insurance industry: the globalization of aviation insurance and reinsurance undertakings, increased competition in aviation insurance sector, the liberalization of the European insurance market, {{and the evolution of}} the international and European <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>liability</b> regime. The implications of these trends for premium rates, and for insurance and reinsurance activities in general, are then assessed. This analysis indicates that the liberalization of the European insurance and reinsurance markets remains incomplete, given that certain essential aspects linked to the activities of insurance undertakings are not harmonized. This lack of consistency within the European regulatory regime is found {{to be a source of}} invisible barriers which hamper the effective application of the European freedoms of establishment and of providing services as established in the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the author identifies a potential for growing friction between the different international regulatory regimes governing <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>liability.</b> Looking to the future, the expected effects of the single European currency and the expansion of the WTO services disciplines is also examined. The author concludes that the effectiveness of traditional structures and organizations of insurance and reinsurance markets are being challenged by profound structural changes in the industry. In this context, the European liberalization could serve as a model for adapting to this changing environment on a regional level so as to benefit from the opportunities provided by competition and globalization...|$|R
40|$|The {{regime of}} {{liability}} governing international carriage by air has undergone {{the most radical}} transformation since the Warsaw Convention was adopted in 1929. One of the factors which contributed to the above measures was the perception in may quarters that the limits of liability under the Warsaw Convention were too low and that, with {{the failure of the}} United States Senate to ratify Montreal Protocol 3, the entire Warsaw Convention was vulnerable to demunciation by the United States government. Such denunciation would effectively abolish part of the framework which carries and their insurers have relied on to resolve claims arising in international transportation.

40|$|The Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air {{was adopted}} when {{aviation}} {{was in its}} developing stage. In order to protect this infant industry, the Convention limited the <b>liability</b> of the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> in international <b>air</b> transportation to certain specified amounts. As time went by the Warsaw Convention was amended by several instruments. The end result {{is that there are}} several instruments to regulate the <b>liability</b> of <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> engaged in international air transportation and most of these instruments provide only limited recovery to passengers. Often, passengers try to break the limits prescribed by the Convention alleging willful misconduct {{on the part of the}} carrier, his servants or agents or by bringing suits against potentially liable third parties like the aircraft manufacturer or by proving that the documents of carriage were faulty. In the mean time, Italy and Japan took matters into their own hands and raised the limits unilaterally. While Italy raised the limits to 100, 000 SDR, Japan waived entirely the Warsaw systems limits of liability. In this thesis, the development of air law till the adoption of the Warsaw Convention and the various amendments carried out to the Convention over the years will be discussed in the first two chapters. The third chapter mainly concentrates on the rationales for ratifying the Guatemala City Protocol through Montreal Protocol No. 3. While arriving at a conclusion as to why the Montreal Protocols have to be ratified for the successful unification of <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>liability</b> in international <b>air</b> transport, the Italian and Japanese "solutions" will be evaluated and conclude why those solutions are to be rejected outright.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005 In the South African law of {{carriage}} by air, {{different rules}} apply {{according to whether}} the carriage is (1) international carriage to which the Carriage by Air Act 17 of 1946 applies, or (2) either international carriage to which that Act does not apply, or purely domestic carriage, that is performed wholly within {{the borders of the}} Republic. International carriage not falling under (1) above, and purely domestic carriage, are governed by the common law except {{to the extent that the}} rule of the common law have been modified by agreement by the conditions of carriage of the individual carrier concerned. However, international carriage under (1) above is governed partly by the rules of certain international conventions which have been incorporated by legislation into our domestic law, and partly by agreements between intentional <b>air</b> <b>carriers.</b> The following international instruments and agreements have a bearing on this class of international carriage: (a) the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, dating form 1929, which firmly established and elaborated, as one of its major tenets, the principle of the <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> for damage caused to passengers, baggage and goods, and also for damage caused by delay; (b) the Hague Protocol of 1955. It was added to the Warsaw Convention with the aim of adapting it to the demands of modem transport; (c) the Guadalajara Convention of 1961 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person Other than the Contracting Carrier. This amendment took the form of a Supplementary Convention because it was concluded to deal with an entirely new subject-matter, namely chartering; (d) the Montreal Agreement, an agreement subscribed to by a number of international <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> whereby the participating carriers voluntarily undertake to assume a more extensive liability for passenger death or injury occurring on international journeys to, from, or via the United States of America, than that which they would have been subject under the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol. As seen above, the Warsaw Convention became the first international legal instrument to establish the principles of liability related to carriage by air. However, the Warsaw Convention has proved insufficient for the requirements of rapid-developing air transport and travel, and as aviation began expanding on a large scale, the Warsaw Convention had to be amended. These amendments however, present problems since some States are only a member to the Warsaw Convention and others are members to both the Warsaw Convention and all its amendments. This in effect means that the unamended and amended conventions co-exist. As a result, the amount of limited liability or compensation for damages caused by aircraft accidents in the Warsaw is controversial and questionable, and no longer provides a uniform body of legal rules. The answer to the inherent flaws of the Warsaw regime is the Montreal Convention of 1999. This Convention evolved from the original Warsaw Convention, but is now no longer a convention for carriers. It is a convention for consumers/passengers. The Montreal Convention aims to modernise the liability regime, to consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments, to ensure orderly development of international air transport operations, and to, once again, ensure uniformity and universality. The Montreal Convention however, will only come into force after 30 countries have ratified it. Since only one country has currently ratified the Convention, it can still take a few years before uniformity is restored. This however does not stop South Africa from following in the footsteps of the European Union by the promulgation of legislation which would give the Montreal Convention immediate effect in South Africa as soon as the Convention came into force.

The definition of delay was made under Hamburg Rules, also the losses caused from <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> for delay is recoverable. When it comes to English Law, the recoverability of the losses caused from delay is a matter of remoteness-foreseeability. The <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> for delay is regulated under Norwegian and Turkish law expressly. Also In Rotterdam Rules <b>carrier's</b> <b>liability</b> for delay expressly regulated, but it is recoverable under the Convention as long as the time of delivery was decided in the contract of carriage. As the previous conventions, Rotterdam Rules does not give an answer how the economic losses will be recoverable. Rotterdam Rules deals with liability for delay expressly, however there are some gaps, which seems like they are left to possible practices in the future.
