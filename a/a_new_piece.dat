5|$|During {{the rest}} of 1932 Gielgud played in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece,</b> Musical Chairs by Ronald Mackenzie, and {{directed}} one new and one classic play, Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West End, and The Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the watchful}} eye of police detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events tells the story of Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence from the agency to investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

25|$|In {{the close}} season {{prior to the}} 2012-13 season, the MyFootballClub Society {{membership}} stood at roughly 1300. A significant drop from the 32,000 peak, but the community remained active in supporting the club both financially {{and in terms of}} time.

25|$|In 1959 Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, moving {{eventually}} {{into a large}} hillside villa at Kapuzinerstraße 9, {{which was}} his main residence {{for the rest of}} his life. Robert Piencikowski suggests a number of reasons for the move to Germany: excellent rehearsal conditions with the South-West German Radio orchestra, with which he had an arrangement to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts; an electronic studio where he could work on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> (Poésie pour pouvoir); but also disenchantment with the cultural and political climate in France under de Gaulle at the time of the Algerian war.|$|E
25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E
25|$|Hertog Jan, a Dutch {{brand of}} beer, {{released}} Stratego Tournament, a promotional version of Stratego with variant rules. It includes substantially fewer pieces, including only one Bomb and no Miners. Since each side has only about 18 pieces, {{the pieces are}} far more mobile. The scout in this version is allowed to move three squares in any combination of directions (including L-shapes) and there is <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> called the Archer, which is defeated by anything, but can defeat any piece other than the Bomb by shooting it from a two-square distance, in direct orthogonal, or straight, directions only. If one player is unable to move any more {{of his or her}} pieces, the game results in a tie because neither player's Flag was captured.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Since traits {{come from}} the genes in a cell, putting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of DNA into a cell can produce a new trait. This is how genetic {{engineering}} works. For example, rice can be given genes from a maize and a soil bacteria so the rice produces beta-carotene, which the body converts to Vitamin A. This can help children suffering from Vitamin A deficiency. Another gene being put into some crops comes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis; the gene makes a protein that is an insecticide. The insecticide kills insects that eat the plants, but is harmless to people. In these plants, the new genes are put into the plant before it is grown, so the genes are {{in every part of}} the plant, including its seeds. The plant's offspring inherit the new genes, which has led to concern about the spread of new traits into wild plants.|$|E
25|$|The Moray Minstrels were an {{informal}} gathering of notable members of London {{society and the}} arts, including painters, actors and writers (all male), who were mostly amateur musicians. They would meet for musical evenings at Moray Lodge, in Kensington, the home of Arthur James Lewis (18241901), a haberdasher and silk merchant (of the firm Lewis & Allenby), who married the actress Kate Terry in 1867. The Minstrels would discuss the arts, smoke and sing part-songs and other popular music at monthly gatherings of more than 150 lovers of the arts; their conductor was John Foster. Foster, {{as well as the}} dramatist F. C. Burnand and many other members were friendly with young Arthur Sullivan, who joined the group. On one occasion in early 1865, they heard a performance of Offenbach's short two-man operetta Les deux aveugles ("The Two Blind Men"). After seeing another operetta at Moray Lodge the following winter, Burnand asked Sullivan to collaborate on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> to be performed for the Minstrels.|$|E

25|$|Theatres had proliferated {{during the}} 1790s, but when Napoleon took power, he {{simplified}} matters by effectively {{reducing the number}} of Parisian opera houses to three. These were the Opéra (for serious operas with recitative not dialogue); the Opéra-Comique (for works with spoken dialogue in French); and the Théâtre-Italien (for imported Italian operas). All three would play a leading role over the next half-century or so. At the Opéra, Gaspare Spontini upheld the serious Gluckian tradition with La Vestale (1807) and Fernand Cortez (1809). Nevertheless, the lighter new opéra-comiques of Boieldieu and Isouard were a bigger hit with French audiences, who also flocked to the Théâtre-Italien to see traditional opera buffa and works in the newly fashionable bel canto style, especially those by Rossini, whose fame was sweeping across Europe. Rossini's influence began to pervade French opéra comique. Its presence is felt in Boieldieu's greatest success, La dame blanche (1825) as well as later works by Auber (Fra Diavolo, 1830; Le domino noir, 1837), Hérold (Zampa, 1831) and Adolphe Adam (Le postillon de Longjumeau, 1836). In 1823, the Théâtre-Italien scored an immense coup when it persuaded Rossini himself to come to Paris and take up the post of manager of the opera house. Rossini arrived to welcome worthy of a modern media celebrity. Not only did he revive the flagging fortunes of the Théâtre-Italien, but he also {{turned his attention to the}} Opéra, giving it French versions of his Italian operas and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece,</b> Guillaume Tell (1829). This proved to be Rossini's final work for the stage. Ground down by the excessive workload of running a theatre and disillusioned by the failure of Tell, Rossini retired as an opera composer.|$|E

Over time, some of the works which have been displayed have been changed to accommodate either a new artist or <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of art.|$|E
500|$|The remake was {{announced}} in February 2012 by Famitsu. For the packaging, Kaneko was asked to design <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of key art.

Game Informer included the game on its list of [...] "RPGs Released Late In The PSP's Life Cycle", games that were likely never to see a release due to the flagging western PSP market. In response to {{the decision not to}} localize the remake, the original version was released on PlayStation Network in 2013. As part of the announcement, PlayStation Blog released a guide showing which characters had received name changes in the original localization. Intended to be playable on PSP, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, a fault at release meant only the PS3 version was playable, which was fixed after players complained about it.|$|E
