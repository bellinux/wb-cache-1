40|$|In the <b>Auto-Oil</b> <b>Programme,</b> the European Commission {{looks for}} {{emission}} limits for cars {{such that the}} urban air quality targets are reached at minimum cost. This optimisation problem was solved by Degraeve et al. (1998). In this paper we deal with two methodological problems in this cost efficiency approach. We study first {{what is known as}} the overachievement problem in cost-effectiveness analysis. In a pure cost-efficiency approach, there is a tendency to understate the merits of federal regulatory measures: because these measures are uniform they will always do more than required in some regions. We prove this and show how this problem can be solved using minimum information on the benefits of environmental improvements. The second problem we study is the implementation problem of local measures. From a European wide perspective, it may be cost-efficient that some regions take local measures but this is not necessary in the interest of these regions when there is transfrontier pollution. When this behavioural constraint is taken into account, the cost efficient bundle will change. We show how these two considerations affect the selection of optimal emission standards for cars in Europe. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{fuel prices}} {{increased}} in 2000, there were {{concerns about the}} impact on the transport sector. Therefore, it was considered worthwhile to simulate the effects of a significant and durable change in oil prices on transport cost, transport demand, and transport externalities. Using TREMOVE, the partial equilibrium model on the transport sector, which was developed {{in the context of the}} European <b>Auto-Oil</b> II <b>Programme,</b> this paper simulates what could happen to transport costs, transport demand and transport emissions if the low oil price or the high oil price were maintained in the long run. This work is the first use of TREMOVE in the European Commission outside its initial purpose, which was to provide cost-effectiveness analysis for the measures defined in the <b>Auto-Oil</b> II <b>Programme.</b> As the model is currently being reviewed, both the outcomes of the simulation and the problems or limits encountered, constitute valuable input for the definition of an improved version of the model. transport sector, fuel prices, taxation, Delsalle...|$|R
40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{approach of}} sensitivity analysis is applied on the solution vector of an Air Quality Model. In particular, the photochemical CAMx code is augmented with derivatives utilising the automatic differentiation software ADIFOR. The enhanced with derivatives {{version of the}} model is then adopted {{in a study of}} the effect of perturbations at the boundary conditions on the predicted ozone concentrations. The calculated derivative matrix provides valuable information e. g., on the ordering of the infl uential factors or the localisation of highly affected regions. Two fundamentally different domains of the <b>Auto-Oil</b> II <b>programme</b> were used as test cases for the simulations, namely Athens and Milan. The results suggest that ozone concentration be highly affected by its own boundary conditions and subsequently, with an order of magnitude less, by the boundary conditions of NOX and VOC...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to chart the {{petroleum}} lobby in the EU, and how oil and gas companies organise themselves in Brussels in order to influence EU policy. I also investigate how {{the relationship between the}} industry and the European Union has changed in recent years. The research question is as follows: Who are the actors representing {{the oil and gas industry}} in the European Union, how do they work and how has the introduction of the internal energy market affected them? I have found that the petroleum industry has a wide set of associations and informal channels that provide these resourceful actors with good access to the EU-institutions. As the industry is concentrated, most companies have multiple memberships. The oil and gas industry controls technical expertise in demand in the Commission in particular, and which gives them access. My findings indicate that there are strong behavioural norms in place in the EU policy-making system. There are informal expectations to behaviour as well as scepticism towards the petroleum industry in the public and within the EU-institutions. These norms discipline the large multinational petroleum companies, turning them into Gentle Giants, which nevertheless have much influence given that they act in accordance with those norms. Additionally, the internal gas market has led to a profound change in how the European gas industry is organised on the European level. The gas companies have become affected parties through the gas directives, something that has made them more legitimate partners for the EU in policy-making. At the same time, the oil associations remain the same, but as the large oil companies are gas companies as well, they may enjoy an enhanced legitimacy overall. After charting the associations of the petroleum industry and their other channels of influence, I use three concrete policy-making processes to illustrate how they are used. First, the <b>Auto-oil</b> I <b>programme</b> will serve to illustrate how important it is to play by the rules, and not to underestimate one of the EU institutions. The Commission tried to create environmental policy with the car manufacturers and the oil industry. The European Parliament did not like to be left out and reacted. The organisation of the oil refineries responded in a way that would only make things worse. In the second example, the emissions trading directive serves to show how acting early can frame an issue. It also illustrates how important it is to present oneself as a constructive player and part of the solution rather than the problem. The third example illustrates how the second gas directive opened up a new playing field, and I will look at how a group of business association quickly and efficiently set up a system to make sure they maintained control over part of the implementation of the directive...|$|R
