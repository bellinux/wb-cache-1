5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both {{males and females}} prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} {{from the beginning of}} Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, differs from that of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor more than in the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion the water displays vortex flow - the water {{at the center of}} the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and the water at the perimeter spins more slowly. The water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper at the perimeter and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more shallow at the center, and the surface of the water is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within the water the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where the water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper, than near the center. The water pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater where the water speed <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower, and the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R

5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less clear; {{molecular}} {{data indicate that}} {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African fish eagle and the Madagascar fish eagle), while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E
5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer}} to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.|$|E

5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{butterfly}} may produce offspring with new mutations. The {{majority of these}} mutations will have no effect; but one might change the color {{of one of the}} butterfly's offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If this color change is advantageous, the chance of this butterfly's surviving and producing its own offspring <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population.|$|E
25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to read everything about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E
25|$|The tide {{components}} with {{a period}} near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) that <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more than twice}} the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.|$|E

25|$|The Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa {{also offers}} a co-op option for some of their {{programs}} including: accounting, commerce, e-business, finance, management, marketing, and few other interconnected programs. With the exception of accounting which starts during the summer before a student’s fourth year, all programs start the summer before a student’s third year of study. Finally as a last category, several co-op graduate programs are offered as well: computer science, economics, globalization and international development, history, information studies, and public and international affairs. The entry requirements for graduate students <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different from those for undergraduate co-operative education programs. In the graduate level, one of {{the requirements of the}} co-op program is that it is crucial that students begin their study in the fall semester because of the co-op program’s placement cycle.|$|E
