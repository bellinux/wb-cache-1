2500|$|Alfred Deakin {{took over}} from Barton as Prime Minister {{and leader of}} the Protectionists. At the 1903 election, the Free Trade Party won 24 seats, with the Labour vote {{increasing}} mainly {{at the expense of the}} Protectionists. In August 1904, when the Watson government resigned, [...] Reid became Prime Minister. He was the first former state premier to become Prime Minister (the only other to date being Joseph Lyons). Reid did not have a majority in either House, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be only a matter of time before the Protectionists patched up their differences with Labour, so he enjoyed himself in office while he could. In July 1905 the other two parties duly voted him out, and he left office with good grace.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 interview, Borges said, [...] "Perón was a humbug, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> and {{everybody}} knew it. But Perón {{could be very}} cruel. I mean, he had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute." [...] When Perón returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for National Geographic, he said [...] "Damn, the snobs {{are back in the}} saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost my sight. Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well." [...] After being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, [...] "I resented Perón's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world... as in 1951, when he announced control over thermonuclear fusion, which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Steinberg says of Bismarck's {{achievements}} to this point: The {{scale of}} Bismarck's triumph cannot be exaggerated. He alone had {{brought about a}} complete transformation of the European international order. He had told those who would listen what he intended to do, how he intended to do it, and he did it. He achieved this incredible feat without commanding an army, and without the ability to give an order to the humblest common soldier, without control of a large party, without public support, indeed, {{in the face of}} almost universal hostility, without a majority in parliament, without control of his cabinet, and without a loyal following in the bureaucracy. He no longer had the support of the powerful conservative interest groups who had helped him achieve power. The most senior diplomats in the foreign service ... were sworn enemies <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> The Queen and the Royal Family hated him and the King, emotional and unreliable, would soon have his 70th birthday. ...

6000|$|... "It's the old game, {{the white}} man's game," [...] Dick laughed. [...] "She's {{not afraid of}} him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> She outgames him, out-savages him, teaches him what savagery is in its {{intimate}} mood and tense." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you, sir!" [...] {{said the}} lad, blushing all the while, as one honestly conscience-stricken; for Tom had spoken the exact truth, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well;--but I had, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> As for the future, of course, {{the thing is}} over. But you have done {{everything}} for the borough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just it. Laying-to now ain't {{going to}} save anybody's life, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> <b>He's</b> doin' it for show, just for a clean record in the log, and to satisfy you people here, who'd kick up a row if he didn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, it's {{all very}} well to say go to bed when a man makes an {{argument}} which another man can't answer. Dan don't never stand any chance in an argument with me. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> too. What should you say, Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} mystery," [...] said Joan, with quiet confidence; [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> {{but no other}} but God. When I see him I will tell him a secret that will drive away his trouble, then he will hold up his head again." ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{pressing}} {{his arm to}} her, she talked of flowers instead, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was done {{that he might not}} feel she came because of her dead lover.|$|E
60|$|Mose {{could not}} explain that for Mary's sake he was {{avoiding}} all danger. There was risk in the contest <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> and he couldn't afford to take it.|$|E

6000|$|... 'He {{could not}} tell you so, Clara, for it is not wrong, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is not. <b>He</b> will thank you by-and-by for not {{attending}} to him, now that <b>he</b> does not <b>know</b> what <b>he</b> says.

6000|$|... 'I {{mean that}} I care more for his little finger {{than for the}} whole world.

60|$|Good, patient, long-enduring John Adams {{began to}} draw {{towards the end}} of his strange, unique, and glorious career. For him to live had been Christ, to die was gain. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was Bertie’s great opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> His {{mother was}} {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} she would look rather ridiculous if the story got about. She was willing to pay hush-money.|$|E

6000|$|I frowned, for I do {{not approve}} of Good's frivolities, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> I turned the {{conversation}} to more serious subjects.

60|$|But in Hide-and-Seek {{he would}} have a better chance. He had always liked that game ever since he had known how to play anything. He was a good little fellow for hiding, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Without waiting another second, Whitefoot scampered away. And {{how he did}} {{hope that}} his scent would have {{disappeared}} by the time Shadow returned. If it hadn't, {{there would be little}} hope for him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An Immortal {{knows when}} a Quickening happens nearby <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> which Immortal is dead, as {{demonstrated}} by Duncan MacLeod in Highlander: The Series.
