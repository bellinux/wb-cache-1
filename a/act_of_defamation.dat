5000|$|Barb Johnson -- Barb Johnson, a litigator {{and member}} of the fathers' right movement, unsuccessfully ran for {{governor}} of Massachusetts in 2002 on a platform of court reform, the need for judicial accountability - particularly in the family-law courts and the abolition of judicial and quasi-judicial immunity. She was later disbarred for what she described as political reasons and for educating fathers about the improper assessment of guardian ad litem fees by Massachusetts family court judges. She attempted to create judicial accountability and abolish judicial immunity through her lawsuit against the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers et al. for <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> and intentional interference with prospective advantageous business relationships associated with her disbarment.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of social interaction}} mediated through the Internet across the globe within {{the past two decades}} has altered the very way in which cultures form and interact. New cultures are evolving devoid of place and physical, face-to-face interaction, generating and flourishing through interaction limited to social media and online chat rooms. One such cultural group, Anonymous, a collective of computer hackers, has evolved out of the Internet to produce <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> and resistance against those it opposes in an in-your-face manner, capturing international headlines and the attention of governments and revolutionaries alike. Through a literature review of Anonymous and computer hacker culture, as well as an ethnographic analysis of Anonymous’ Twitter and Facebook feeds, it is evident that the means by which Anonymous communicates and engages in direct, daily actions of resistance or sabotage against its targets can be understood through the application and adaptation of anthropologist Clifford Geertz’s concept of deep play. The hacks carried out by Anonymous pose high stakes for players in that the individual is on the line, much {{in the same way as}} Geertz’s Balinese cock-fighters risk their livelihood and social position by engaging in illegal cockfighting. Just as the cockfight enables the Balinese to symbolically engage in societal critique and competition, the hacking executed by Anonymous functions to provide the same type of engagement while simultaneously extending this critique to directly challenge status hierarchies and the inequalities embedded within both global and local social matrices...|$|R

50|$|Grant v Torstar Corp, , is a 2009 Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} on the defences to the tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation.</b> The Supreme Court ruled that the law <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> should {{give way to the}} rights of a party to speak on matters of public interest, provided the party exercises a certain level of responsibility in verifying the potentially defamatory facts.

40|$|When {{comparing}} the seminal Supreme Court <b>of</b> Canada <b>defamation</b> decisions <b>of</b> the 1990 s and 2000 s, {{it is apparent}} that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s view on the importance of protecting reputation has changed. Recent decisions hail the importance of using freedom of expression as a countervailing interest against the oft-criticized strictures of the common law <b>of</b> <b>defamation.</b> Fundamental alterations in the nature of mass and interactive media and in the nature of reputation are two phenomena informing this change. Increased attention to the theorizing of 2 ̆ 2 reputation, 2 ̆ 2 the interest whose protection animates the entire tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation,</b> reveals that reputation is itself a highly constructed, contextual, and malleable artifact. This article proposes recasting the tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> into two different tracks: one for public figures, who pose the highest risk of abusing the tort, and one for private plaintiffs, whose reputational interest is akin to traditional notions of reputation...|$|R

40|$|The American legal {{doctrine}} of actual malice in tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation,</b> {{developed by the}} U. S. Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan and its progeny, {{is one of the}} hallmarks of the exceptionally speech-protective First Amendment jurisprudence, which departs from most of other western democracies. That much is well-known. What is little known in comparative law literature is that an Asian new democracy, Taiwan, has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in the past decade to transplant the {{doctrine of}} actual malice in its laws <b>of</b> <b>defamation.</b> In this article, I analyze how the actual malice doctrine was transplanted in Taiwan and how it underwent extraordinary twists and turns in Taiwan’s criminal and tort defamation laws in the past decade. I argue that Taiwan’s severe political polarization since 2000 first led to its rise in tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation,</b> and also to its eventual downfall. It was followed then by the eventual divergence of criminal and tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> in terms <b>of</b> fault degree, with criminal defamation leaning consistently toward actual malice and tort <b>of</b> <b>defamation</b> back to negligence. The divergence was a sensible response to the wildly irresponsible culture of exposé in Taiwan’s public sphere that developed since 2005. By investigating Taiwan’s extraordinary experiment, I argue that actual malice presumes a thick layer of social consensus on what counts as irresponsible speech. When political polarization and political distrust destroys the social consensus, the “reckless disregard of truth and falsity” prong of actual malice collapses along with it, {{as is the case with}} Taiwan’s criminal libel during the height of political conflict...|$|R
