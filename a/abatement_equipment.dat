All S&M Program activities during fiscal year (FY) 1997 were accomplished safely, with no health and safety incidents, no lost work days, and no environmental noncompliances. In addition, all activities were performed within schedule thresholds and under budget. Many remedial action (RA) sites and decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) facilities are inspected and maintained by the S&M Program. RA sites encompass approximately 650 acres and 33 D&D facilities, including 4 inactive reactors. During FY 1997, routine, preventative, and emergency maintenance activities were performed as needed at these sites and facilities. Stabilization activities were also performed to reduce risks and reduce future S&M costs. Major activities at the RA sites during FY 1997 included maintaining proper liquid levels in surface impoundments and inactive -liquid low-level waste storage tanks as well as installing a new cover at the tumulus pads in Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 6, planting trees in the First Creek Riparian Corridor, and performing over 900 well inspections. Postremediation monitoring was conducted at the 3001 Canal, Core Hole 8, the WAG 6 Resource Conservation and Recovery caps, and WAG 5 Seeps C and D; groundwater monitoring was performed in WAGs 4, 5, and 6 and at the 3001 Canal Well.

40|$|The {{unilateral}} {{introduction of}} an emissions price can induce firms {{to relocate to}} other countries with less stringent environmental regulation. However, firms {{may be able to}} reduce the emissions costs in their home country by investing into low-carbon technologies or <b>equipment</b> (<b>abatement</b> capital). Using a two-period model with asymmetric information, we study the optimal design of contracts offered by a regulator who seeks to avert the relocation of a polluting firm to another country. The transfers are contingent on the firm's emissions that are observable to the regulator, and terminate if the firm relocates. We show that under limited commitment, the regulator implements more stringent policies in the first period to induce higher abatement capital investments. This creates a `lock-in effect' that prevents relocation {{even in the absence of}} transfers in period 2. We also show that types are not separated if relocation is sufficiently attractive. In practice, the transfers may be implemented via a free allocation of permits if the emissions price arises within an emissions trading scheme...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} of New Caledonia has evolved strategies, technologies and policies {{to maintain the}} balance between environmental conservation measures and mining industry. The new legislation has ensured enforcement of installing pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment</b> followed by re-plantation of vegetation after mine is exploited, and technological improvements for efficient economic extraction concomitant with environmental friendly pollution control measures. The government regulations have been effectively adopted by mine inspectors and through environmental impact assessments since 1992, even though regulations have been existence for 15 years prior to that. Apart from introducing new techniques, other measures adopted for environmental abatement are: 14 zones covering 19430 ha have been declared protected areas from prospecting or mining, construction of sedimentation barriers, catchment area treatment, creation of settlement basin and terraces to reduce silt flow into streams and rivers, minimum road building activity {{in the area of}} mining, creation of a vegetation barrier along roads and {{in the vicinity of the}} mines, adopt satellite remote sensing techniques for mapping and locating mining areas which would avoid road building for the purpose and completely re-vegetate the closed or fully extracted mines. In addition, a monitoring team of inspectors of mines is also instituted to check and ensure that pollution abatement measures are fully implemented. In 1994, a mining centre was set up at Nepoui-Kopeto not only to increase productivity levels by adopting modern mining methods but also to develop pollution control capabilities at mining sites.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{environmental}} consciousness on firms ’ adoption decisions toward a pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment.</b> The impact of environmental awareness takes a form of cost reduction, which turns the interaction among firms into a coordination game with multiple equilibria: either both firms adopt or no one adopts. This {{is contrary to the}} various facts of partially coordination on pollution control. Moreover, two prominent criteria for equilibrium selection suggest that the equilib-rium with no adoption should be chosen. We provide a solution by proving the existence of collusion outcomes in subgames following asymmetric adop-tion decisions. Such a subgame outcome, in turn, supports the asymmetric adoptions (partially coordination) as part of a subgame perfect equilibrium. JEL classification: Q 28, H 21, C 61, C 79...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the long-term investment decisions of firms that are regulated by an emissions tax and that perceive {{a degree of}} market power in their respective output markets. Firms invest in <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment</b> that is fixed over the medium term (e. g., buying a new generator). This paper focuses on environmental regulation with and without commitment.

In the no-commitment case, the regulator announces a tax level and is free to modify it once firms have invested. This paper considers differentiated product goods and determines whether no-commitment regulation leads to more lenient or more stringent regulation than regulation with commitment.

We use original firm-level data on both air emissions and investments in <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment.</b> We deal with endogeneity issues by exploiting some regional heterogeneity in the performance standards imposed to the firms. Carrying out estimations on an unbalanced panel of 1463 observations over the period 1995 - 1999, {{we find that the}} abatement marginal cost for sulfur dioxides exceeds several times the French current tax rate. This suggests that, for this pollutant, the level of emissions is currently much more determined by the performance standards than by the tax.

40|$|The Motorola Exhaust Optimization Program strives toward {{identifying}} the optimum exhaust requirements for gas panel enclosures to help conserve energy and provide future exhaust capacity for new tools.

This is equivalent to over 35 million kWh per a year for a typical Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (SPS) fab. These obtained studies have prompted Motorola to focus on a broad range of energy conservation projects. This paper will focus on exhaust optimization through tracer gas testing. Testing has resulted in exhaust and make-up air reductions of as high as 70 % of manufacturer's specifications per gas enclosure.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the timing and}} interdependence between innovation and environmental policy in a model {{of research and development}} (R&D). On a first-best path the environmental tax is set at the Pigouvian level, independent of innovation policy. With infinite patent lifetime, the R&D subsidy should be constant and independent {{of the state of the}} environment. However, with finite patent lifetime, optimal innovation policy depends on the stage of the environmental problem. In the early stages of an environmental problem, abatement research should be subsidized at a high level and this subsidy should fall monotonically over time to stimulate initial R&D investments. Alternatively, with a constant R&D subsidy, patents ’ length should initially have a very long life-time but this should be gradually shortened. In a second-best situation with no deployment subsidy for <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment,</b> we find that the environmental tax should be high compared to the Pigouvian levels when an abatement industry is developing, but the relative difference falls over time.

30|$|Pollution {{abatement}} {{investments are}} {{not statistically significant}} {{for any of the}} types of inefficiency scores that are examined. This result indicates that a large quantity of pollution abatement investment decreases capital productivity in manufacturing sectors. One of the reasons for this effect may be that legal considerations involving environmental regulations caused many factories to purchase a large quantity of pollution treatment equipment. However, due to the weakness of regulation implementation in China, these factories only use the <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment</b> during certain specific moments known as a “show”. This practice allows the factories in question to reduce their operational costs of running the equipment. Another reason for the lack of a significant relationship between pollution abatement investments and inefficiency scores may be that our data only reflect the quantity of investments that were devoted to end-of-pipe treatments. Although end-of-pipe treatment equipment directly affects pollution reduction, it does not directly affect the total amount of pollution emissions. This result suggests that environmental regulations and the monitoring of pollutant emissions should be more strictly implemented in China.|$|E
40|$|Debt swaps as an {{instrument}} of international cooperation in environmental field were conceived and first applied in the 1980 s. They were once thought of as "win-win" arrangements solving environmental and economic problems at the same time. In the 1990 s it became clear, however, that (1) debt-for-environment swaps attracted as little as 1 - 2 percent of debt swap schemes (with debt-for-equity swaps taking almost all the rest), and (2) the effectiveness and efficiency of those carried out was sometimes problematic. The paper addresses the question of why [...] despite high expectations [...] debt-for-environment swaps have not emerged as a major international environmental policy tool.

40|$|Using patent {{data from}} the United States, Japan, and Germany, this paper {{examines}} both the innovation and diffusion of air pollution control equipment. Whereas the United States was an early adopter of stringent sulfur dioxide (SO 2) standards, both Japan and Germany introduced stringent nitrogen dioxide (NOX) standards much earlier than the US. Nonetheless, in both cases, tightened standards in the U. S. led to more domestic patenting, but not more foreign patenting. Overall, the data suggest that inventors respond to environmental regulatory pressure in their own country, but not to foreign environmental regulations. Moreover, any technology transfer that occurs appears to be indirect. Domestic innovation occurs even for technologies that have already experienced significant innovative activity abroad. Moreover, utilities in countries that adopt regulations later nonetheless purchase pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>equipment</b> from domestic firms. However, patent citation {{data from the}} U. S. show that earlier foreign patents are an important building block for NOX pollution control innovations in the U. S., suggesting that American inventors build on technological advances made in countries that adopted stringent regulation earlier. ...|$|E
