5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the reign}} of Edward II was {{initially}} harmonious, he soon met with opposition from several of his earls and prelates. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the discontent was the king's relationship with the young Gascon knight Piers Gaveston, who had been exiled by Edward I, but was recalled immediately upon Edward II's accession. Edward's favouritism towards the upstart Gaveston was an offence to the established nobility, and his elevation to the earldom of Cornwall was particularly offensive to the established nobility. A group of magnates led by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, forced Gaveston into exile in 1308. By 1309, however, Edward had reconciled himself with the opposition, and Gaveston was allowed to return.|$|E

5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser {{human beings who}} benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>source,</b> supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E

25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified energy fields. Taking light as an example, receptors in our eyes turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in our eye is triggered our brain energy field merges with the energy field of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> and at the receiver are happening at the same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional energy field remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>source.</b> It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|E
