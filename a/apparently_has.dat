5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

25|$|The {{quotation}} {{above is}} from a 1997 article proposing a relaxed global serializability solution (see Relaxing global serializability below), and referencing Commitment ordering (CO) articles. The CO solution supports effectively both full ACID properties and full local autonomy, as well as meeting the other requirements posed above in the Problem statement section, and <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> been misunderstood.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people may}} have coined the same new term from these roots independently. Hercules Florence, a French painter and {{inventor}} living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French form of the word, photographie, in private notes which a Brazilian historian believes were written in 1834. This claim is widely reported but <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> never been independently confirmed as beyond reasonable doubt.|$|E
25|$|Pine resin (sap) {{has been}} used by various tribes to {{waterproof}} baskets, pails, and boats. The Chippewa also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds. This is because pine resin <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.|$|E

25|$|Lon Cohen — of the New York Gazette, Archie's {{pipeline}} to breaking crime news. Lon <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> no official title at the Gazette but occupies a room just {{two doors down}} from the publisher's corner office. Archie frequently asks Lon for background information on current or prospective clients, and returns those favors by providing Lon exclusives, and occasional photos, concerning Wolfe's cases. Lon {{is also one of}} Archie's poker-playing pals.|$|E
25|$|The book {{left the}} {{impression}} that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth in my daughter's case. The list <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> developed a life of its own and for Today to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother Jerry can.|$|E
25|$|Pacific {{coast of}} South America. This species <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> no close living relatives. It has a highly apomorphic colour pattern: naked red base of bill, red feet, {{and a white}} neck spot, and it is crestless. It seems to be {{convergent}} in some aspects with the punctatus superspecies. What seems sure is that this species must {{be placed in a}} distinct monotypic genus Poikilocarbo in almost any case, if any species are split from Phalacrocorax at all.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} series, S.Baldrick has lost almost all {{intelligence}} and <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> {{no desire to}} rise in social standing and claims in the first episode that his goal in life is the acquisition of turnips. Ironically, in the same episode, Baldrick is appointed to the House of Lords by Prince George and thus becomes upper class, {{one of the greatest}} achievements of the Baldrick family. He also haggles for a priceless turnip (£400,000). Baldrick's turnip is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.|$|E
25|$|Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, a mid-level bureaucrat with {{a strong}} love of her home town of Pawnee, who has not let {{politics}} dampen her sense of optimism (which <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> lasted six years in her job); her {{ultimate goal is to}} become President of the United States. Poehler departed from the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, where she was a cast member for nearly seven years, to star in Parks and Recreation. It was only after she was cast that Daniels and Schur established the general concept of the show and the script for the pilot was written.|$|E
25|$|A {{third group}} that <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> his special {{interest}} are the terrestrial operculates, {{formerly known as}} ‘Prosobranchia’, a heterogeneous assemblage of gastropods with an operculum and separate males and females (in contrast to the hermaphrodite pulmonate land snails). Operculate gastropods appear to be particularly poorly represented in subsaharan Africa in comparison to other continents, especially tropical Asia. Since the early 1980s Dolf has taken it on him to revise the African representatives of this group, especially the families Maizaniidae and Cyclophoridae. This study resulted {{in the description of}} three new subgenera and ten new species (thereby doubling the number of African taxa known), and a series of papers with careful descriptions, keys and biogeographic analyses of the ‘prosobranch’ fauna in Africa and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{features}} are sparse or unresolved {{in this part}} of Mercury. The Kuiper quadrangle <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> none of the scarps that occur elsewhere on the planet that have been interpreted as high-angle reverse faults. The most prominent structures are the rings associated with some large craters or basins, faults that transect crater floors, and lobate scarps and ridges in the plains materials. Most of the faults and scarps that transect crater floors clearly delineate crater-filling materials standing at different levels, and in at least two craters (19° S., 31°; 16° N., 30°), the traces of the faults on the crater walls indicate that the faults have normal displacements. A few faults cut intercrater areas and trend generally northwest or northeast (Scott and others, 1976).|$|E
25|$|Gulls are monogamous {{and colonial}} breeders that display mate {{fidelity}} that usually lasts {{for the life}} of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a 5-m radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Fight Lab" [...] {{section of}} the game, Lee Chaolan, {{under the guise of}} Violet is working on a new version of Combot. As soon as Combot is complete, Violet begins its {{simulation}} test. After the simulation test, the Combot explodes and destroys the lab. Violet decides to use the other functioning Combot to complete the tests. After Combot completes five tests, Violet kidnaps Jin, Kazuya and Heihachi for Combot's final test. Combot <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> the upper hand, but Jin transforms into his Devil form and destroys it. Violet blows up the Combot, presumably taking the Mishima bloodline with it, and says, [...] "Excellent!".|$|E

500|$|The {{cause of}} Terri Schiavo's {{collapse}} {{was determined to}} be cardiac arrest. Her medical chart contained a note that [...] "she <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of iced tea." [...] Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from hypokalemia (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, Pressman and St. Martin's Press had {{received}} approximately two dozen letters from Erhard's attorney Walter Maksym, though Erhard's representatives {{had yet to}} see the book itself. Maksym told the San Francisco Daily Journal in March 1993 {{that he wanted to}} [...] "fact check the book", because he believed that [...] "this is a first-time unknown author who <b>apparently</b> <b>has</b> interviewed only people who have negative things to say", and stated [...] "We have cautioned the publisher that they are responsible for the accuracy of the book." [...] Charlie Spicer, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, described the actions of Erhard's representatives with regard to the book as [...] "a desperate campaign by someone with something to hide". The author himself made specific reference to his legal support, mentioning [...] "the potential legal rapids that confront authors writing these days about controversial subjects".|$|E
