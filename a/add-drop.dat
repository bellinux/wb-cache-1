5000|$|SDH <b>Add-Drop</b> Multiplexer [...] - [...] The SDH <b>Add-Drop</b> Multiplexer (ADM) can add {{or remove}} any {{multiplexed}} frame down to 1.544Mb. Below this level, standard TDM can be performed.

50|$|An optical <b>add-drop</b> {{multiplexer}} (OADM) can {{be viewed}} as a special case of an OXC, where to node degree is two.|$|E
50|$|An {{emerging}} {{variety of}} ADMs that is becoming popular as the carriers continue {{to invest in}} metro optical networks are reconfigurable optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers (ROADMs).|$|E
50|$|In fiber optics, a {{reconfigurable}} optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer (ROADM) {{is a form}} {{of optical}} <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer that adds the ability to remotely switch traffic from a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system at the wavelength layer. This is achieved {{through the use of a}} wavelength selective switching module. This allows individual or multiple wavelengths carrying data channels to be added and/or dropped from a transport fiber without the need to convert the signals on all of the WDM channels to electronic signals and back again to optical signals.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>add-drop</b> {{multiplexer}} (ADM) is {{an important}} element of an optical fiber network. A multiplexer combines, or multiplexes, several lower-bandwidth streams of data into a single beam of light. An <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer also has the capability to add one or more lower-bandwidth signals to an existing high-bandwidth data stream, {{and at the same time}} can extract or drop other low-bandwidth signals, removing them from the stream and redirecting them to some other network path. This is used as a local [...] "on-ramp" [...] and [...] "off-ramp" [...] to the high-speed network.|$|E

50|$|Optical {{switching}} technology {{is driven by}} the need to provide flexibility in optical network connectivity.

5000|$|Converting the {{optically}} carried {{signals to}} electrical signals, using an <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer to divide and recombine the signals on the desired paths, the reconverting back to optically carried signals. This signal conversion and multiplexing equipment will require power.|$|E
50|$|In optical communications, typical {{roles for}} optical {{performance}} monitoring include ensuring correct switching in reconfigurable optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers, setting levels for dynamic equalization of the gain of optical amplifiers, and providing system alarms and error warning for lost {{or out of}} specification optical channels.|$|E
50|$|The {{switching}} products {{include a}} family of high-speed crosspoint switches capable of switching traffic within network switching equipment. Typical equipment applications for switching products include OTN systems, <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers, high-density IP switches and storage-area routers. In addition, crosspoint switches are used for broadcast video routing and production switching applications.|$|E
5000|$|ADMs can be {{used both}} in {{long-haul}} core networks and in shorter-distance [...] "metro" [...] networks, although the former are much more expensive due {{to the difficulty of}} scaling the technology to the high data rates and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) used for long-haul communications. The main optical filtering technology used in <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers is the Fabry-Pérot etalon.|$|E
50|$|Tunable lasers are {{sometimes}} used {{to allow a}} module to support various forms of network-based optical switching such as needed in certain cases by an optical mesh networks or a Reconfigurable optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer (ROADM). In these, the transmit laser can be tuned to a different optical frequency/wavelength. Similarly the receiver is able to receive different optical frequencies.|$|E
50|$|At the PoP, the customer's {{aggregated}} {{information is}} typically directed into an <b>Add-drop</b> multiplexer or an MSPP (multiservice provisioning platform), which {{are complex and}} expensive devices that sit between customers and the core network.

5000|$|As the {{transport}} networks gradually developed from digital cross connect system (DCS)-based mesh networks, to SONET ring networks, and to optical mesh networks over the years, {{so did the}} recovery architecture used therein. The recovery architectures used for the different transport networks are: DCS-based mesh networks restoration of DS3 facilities, <b>Add-Drop</b> Multiplexer (ADM)-based ring protection of SONET ring networks, and finally Optical Cross Connect (OXC)-based mixed protection and restoration of optical mesh networks ...|$|E
50|$|The BBG Submarine Communications Cable build by Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks is a three fibre pair cable, with {{submerged}} Repeaters, submarine branching {{units and}} reconfigurable optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers {{and is based}} on 100G dense wavelength division multiplexing Coherent Technology, utilising wavelength add/drop branching units along the route with an overall design capacity of 10 Tbit/s per fibre pair, underpinning the continued bandwidth growth of new broadband applications and services in the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and the Far East.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{transport}} networks {{are made of}} optical fiber-based links between telecommunications offices, where multiple wavelengths are multiplexed to increase {{the capacity of the}} fiber. The wavelengths are terminated on electronic devices called transponders, undergoing an optical-to-electrical conversion for signal Reamplification, Reshaping, and Retiming (3R). Inside a telecommunications office, the signals are then handled to and switched by a transport switch (aka optical cross-connect or optical switch) and either are dropped at that office, or directed to an outgoing fiber link where they are again carried as wavelengths multiplexed into that fiber link towards the next telecommunications office. The act of going through Optical-Electrical-Optical (O-E-O) conversion through a telecommunications office causes the network to be considered opaque. When the incoming wavelengths do not undergo an optical-to-electrical conversion and are switched through a telecommunications office in the optical domain using all-optical switches (also called photonic cross-connect, optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer, or Reconfigurable Optical <b>Add-Drop</b> Multiplexer (ROADM) systems), the network is considered to be transparent. Hybrid schemes that leverage optical bypasses and provide limited O-E-O conversions at key locations across the network, are referred to as translucent networks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Add-drop</b> {{multiplexers}} (ADMs) are {{the most}} common type of network elements. Traditional ADMs were designed to support one of the network architectures, though new generation systems can often support several architectures, sometimes simultaneously. ADMs traditionally have a high-speed side (where the full line rate signal is supported), and a low-speed side, which can consist of electrical as well as optical interfaces. The low-speed side takes in low-speed signals, which are multiplexed by the network element and sent out from the high-speed side, or vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|A unique {{aspect of}} Camp Lohikan is that campers can {{create their own}} {{activity}} schedule each and every day. In the mornings, the campers are assisted to what Camp Lohikan calls, The <b>Add-Drop</b> pavilion. Here, {{they are able to}} sign up for activities at specifically marked-off tables. They receive an index card where they can get each activity written in by the instructor at each table. If campers have trouble getting the activities that they want, there are professional staff and camp directors always available to help.|$|E
50|$|By first mapping {{into one}} or more PDH tributaries such as T1, E1, or DS3, the {{component}} Ethernet contained in separate PDH signals from a central location can be fanned out to multiple locations. EoPoS allows transport of native Ethernet frames over a SONET/SDH network. Then the component PDH can then be separately dropped using a legacy <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer. Finally, the PDH links are resolved back to Ethernet connections by equipment supporting EoPDH. For proper operation each of the {{virtual local area network}} must be individually tagged using IEEE 802.1Q for example.|$|E
5000|$|Telecommunications {{networks}} employing {{wavelength division multiplexing}} have <b>add-drop</b> multiplexers with {{banks of}} miniature tuned fused silica or diamond etalons. These are small iridescent cubes about 2 mm on a side, mounted in small high-precision racks. The materials are chosen to maintain stable mirror-to-mirror distances, and to keep stable frequencies even when the temperature varies. Diamond is preferred because it has greater heat conduction and still has a low coefficient of expansion. In 2005, some telecommunications equipment companies began using solid etalons that are themselves optical fibers. This eliminates most mounting, alignment and cooling difficulties.|$|E
50|$|Optical passive {{products}} - including {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM), amplifier filter WDMs (for network applications, such as splitting wavelengths {{and connecting}} lasers), dense wave division multiplexers (DWDMs), coarse wavelength division multiplexers (CWDM, multiplex ing optical signals of different wavelengths on a single fiber.), compact coarse wavelength division multiplexers (CCWDMs, a package less than 1/4 the size of conventional CWDM modules), add/drop DWDM filters, optical isolators, optical bypass switches, and automatic variable optical attenuators (used in applications of DWDM networks). The Company also offers optical <b>add-drop</b> modules (OADMs), for CWDM networks, adding or dropping from one to fifteen channels.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{application}} of fiber Bragg gratings is in optical communications systems. They are specifically used as notch filters. They {{are also used}} in optical multiplexers and demultiplexers with an optical circulator, or optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer (OADM). Figure 5 shows 4 channels, depicted as 4 colours, impinging onto a FBG via an optical circulator. The FBG is set to reflect one of the channels, here channel 4. The signal is reflected back to the circulator where it is directed down and {{dropped out of the}} system. Since the channel has been dropped, another signal on that channel can be added at the same point in the network.|$|E
5000|$|An optical <b>add-drop</b> {{multiplexer}} (OADM) is {{a device}} used in wavelength-division multiplexing systems for multiplexing and routing different channels of light into {{or out of}} a single mode fiber (SMF). This {{is a type of}} optical node, which is generally used for the formation and the construction of optical telecommunications networks. [...] "Add" [...] and [...] "drop" [...] here refer to the capability of the device to add one or more new wavelength channels to an existing multi-wavelength WDM signal, and/or to drop (remove) one or more channels, passing those signals to another network path. An OADM may be considered to be a specific type of optical cross-connect.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{grooming}} is {{the process}} of grouping many small telecommunications flows into larger units, which can be processed as single entities. For example, in a network using both time-division multiplexing (TDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), two flows which are destined for a common node can be placed on the same wavelength, allowing them to be dropped by a single optical <b>add-drop</b> multiplexer. Often the objective of grooming is minimizing the cost of the network. The cost of line terminating equipment (LTE) (also called add/drop multiplexers or ADMs) is the most dominant component in an optical WDM network's cost. Thus grooming typically involves minimizing the usage of ADMs.|$|E
5000|$|Cerent's {{first product}} was the Cerent 454 (later the Cisco 15454). The Cerent 454 {{was a second}} {{generation}} SONET ADM (<b>Add-Drop</b> Multiplexor) that also supported TCP/IP data switching. When operating as a pure ADM, the 454 could add and drop circuits from OC-192 down to Digital Signal 1 (DS1) -- later it would support Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). Unlike the ADMs that preceded it, a transport signal {{did not have to}} be terminated outside the box to switch or route the TCP/IP packets. [...] "Data cards" [...] could be inserted into the chassis which would terminate the circuits then switch or route the packets between those terminated circuits. This capability meant carriers no longer had to purchase two boxes (e.g. an ADM and a router) just to move TCP/IP packets around its telecom network.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, {{the town}} began to refill its tanks and bring new {{supplies}} online. Campus officials began to {{plan to have}} students back on campus on Sunday. Inevitably, a blame game ensued between town and campus officials, but eventually this settled down as focus shifted on bringing students back. Students were also reimbursed for room and dining commons. Depending on their meal plan, students were reimbursed between $22.89 and $26.76. A plan {{by the president of}} the Student Government Association to charter fifteen busses was turned down. Bathrooms were also cleaned and disinfected to allow for students to come back and an extension of the <b>add-drop</b> deadline was announced. One entrepreneuing student who stayed behind began to hawk “UMass Evacuation” T-shirts, which showed a dripping faucet labeled “Amherst DPW”. All one hundred and sixty-eight shirts were sold within two hours.|$|E
