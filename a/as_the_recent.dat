5|$|While {{the name}} Thuthmose {{had also been}} {{identified}} (but not read) by Young who realized that the first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was {{able to read the}} phonetic spelling of {{the second part of the}} word, and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> ones used the same writing system, and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 2 April, a five-hour meeting of local political leaders took place in Kupres, {{at the request of}} JNA. The purpose of the meeting, attended by members of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Biljana Plavšić and Franjo Boras, was to defuse the situation. While there was an agreement to establish an ethnically balanced police force in Kupres and remove the roadblocks, the opposing sides could not agree {{on the role of the}} JNA. The Bosnian Serbs wanted the JNA to deploy to Kupres itself to ensure their protection, while the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks wanted it to leave. During that same day, the 30th Partisan Division ordered the forces under its command, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> reinforcements, to capture Kupres and Kupreška Vrata and then hold their ground against anticipated Croatian counterattacks. Bosnian Croat authorities ordered the mobilisation of TO units in the nearby towns of Tomislavgrad and Posušje, with an armoured force at their disposal consisting of two T-55 tanks, two M36 tank destroyers, and one BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicle.|$|E
25|$|These Command Vehicles {{are only}} {{deployed}} to strategic locations to provide forward tactical headquarters capability in major incidents or high-risk events, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> IMF-World Bank conference held in Singapore in 2006.|$|E

25|$|French colonial policy {{incorporated}} {{concepts of}} assimilation and association. Based on an {{assumption of the}} superiority of French culture over all others, in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of French language, institutions, laws, and customs to the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed {{the superiority of the}} French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> abolition of the slave trade.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the coming}} of Europeans to the New World, the area which is now Windsor Terrace was {{inhabited}} by the Canarsee Indians. Specifically, the Gowanus and Werpos tribes inhabited the surrounding area. The land, which was then in the far northwestern corner of the Town of Flatbush, was purchased as a farm by John Vanderbilt. Some parts of the land were also maintained by the Martense family, who owned land in the area through 1895. This area was desirable due to its proximity to downtown Brooklyn, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> construction of the Coney Island Plank Road through the area and of the serene Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest.|$|E
25|$|In August 1955, black {{teenager}} Emmett Till {{was brutally}} murdered after reportedly flirting {{with a young}} white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. On November 27, 1955, four days before she would make her stand on the bus, Rosa Parks attended a mass meeting at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery that addressed this case as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> murders of the activists George W. Lee and Lamar Smith. The featured speaker was T. R. M. Howard, a black civil rights leader from Mississippi who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. Howard brought news of the recent acquittal {{of the two men}} who had murdered Till. Parks was deeply saddened and angry at the news, particularly because Till's case had garnered much more attention than any of the cases she and the Montgomery NAACP had worked on—and yet, the two men still walked free.|$|E

25|$|American Motors' major stockholder, Renault, {{was itself}} {{experiencing}} financial trouble in France. The investment in AMC (including {{construction of a}} new Canadian assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass layoffs. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, Georges Besse, continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as Bramalea Assembly, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0L and 2.5L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.|$|E
25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes {{a novel about}} the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{posted a}} number of reviews on its website. Julia Reaside deemed the series a [...] "perfectly cast remake of Swedish-Danish crime hit", and stated that [...] "this {{confirms}} Dillane {{as one of our}} very finest. Such control. Poésy is beautifully chilly, and Joseph Mawle (another cracker) leads an asylum-seeker subplot. It's also really funny." [...] Writing about the finale, Reaside said of Dillane's performance: [...] "If this were on a terrestrial channel, he'd be up for all the awards." [...] On the Karl–Elise partnership, she stated: [...] "I wasn't sure about them as a pairing but was immediately convinced by their uncomfortable chemistry." [...] Having not enjoyed The Bridge, Andrew Anthony called The Tunnel an [...] "attractive proposition", adding that [...] "there's an engaging confidence to the slow revelation of the story. All in all, this looks good." [...] Sam Wollaston was more critical of the series, stating that, while the tone was [...] "atmospheric, intriguing, gripping" [...] and there were strong performances from the lead cast members, The Tunnel was [...] "exactly the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> (<b>recent)</b> original". [...] Wollaston felt that the only [...] "obvious" [...] difference was that, in the original series, there [...] "was a bridge, this is a tunnel. However magnificent an engineering feat the Channel tunnel is, it can't compete as a spectacular location with the Øresund Bridge." ...|$|E
