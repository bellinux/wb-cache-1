50|$|Apart from {{specimens}} that {{he collected}} or received from others both of eggs and birds, Baker also maintained a small menagerie {{for a time}} when he was posted in the North Cachar district. The animals in his collection included civets, bears, deer and crested serpent eagles, <b>Amur</b> <b>falcons,</b> falconets and woodpeckers.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the louse species harboured by Red-footed and <b>Amur</b> <b>Falcons</b> despite the fact that various life-history traits of these hosts make them good model species to study host-parasite interactions. We {{collected}} lice samples from fully grown Amur (n= 20) and Red-footed Falcons (n= 59), and from nestlings of Red-footed Falcons (n= 179) in four countries: Hungary, India, Italy and South Africa. We identified 3 louse species on both host species, namely Degeeriella rufa, Colpocephalum subzerafae and Laembothrion tinnunculi. The latter species has never been found on these hosts. Comparing population parameters of lice between hosts we found significantly higher prevalence levels of D. rufa and C. subzerafae on <b>Amur</b> <b>Falcons.</b> Adult Red-footed Falcons had higher D. rufa prevalence compared to C. subzerafae. For the first time we also show inter-annual shift in prevalence and intensity levels of these species on Red-footed Falcons; in 2012 on adult hosts C. subzerafae had higher intensity levels than D. rufa, however in 2014 D. rufa had significantly higher intensity compared to C. subzerafae. In case of nestlings both louse species had significantly higher preva lence levels than in 2014. The exact causes of such inter-annual shifts are yet to be understood...|$|R
50|$|Some species follow {{variants}} of the route.The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> breeds in northeastern Asia and overwinters in southern Africa, making a round-trip journey of 22000 km. Most of these birds fly {{south along the}} eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and stop in northeastern India and Bangladesh for several months. In late November the falcons cross India and fly in great flocks 3000 km over the Indian Ocean to Somalia and Kenya. They return via the Arabian peninsula, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> was {{formerly}} included herein as a subspecies {{but it is}} nowadays considered distinct. Nonetheless, it is the present species' closest relative; their relationship to other falcons is more enigmatic. They appear morphologically somewhat intermediate between kestrels and hobbies and DNA sequence data {{has been unable to}} further resolve this question, mainly due to lack of comprehensive sampling. They might be closer to the merlin than to most other living falcons, or more generally related to this species and American falcons such as the American kestrel and the aplomado falcon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> feeds mainly late in {{the evening}} or early in the morning {{capturing}} a wide range of insects in the air or on the ground. They capture most of their prey in flight, sometimes by hovering, but will also pick prey by alighting on the ground. The winter diet appears to be almost entirely made up of insects but they take small birds and amphibians to feed their young in their breeding range. The rains in Africa produce swarms of termites, locusts, ants and beetles that provide ample food. Their migration over the Arabian Sea coincides with the timing of the migration of dragonflies (Pantala flavescens) and these are thought to provide food during the most arduous part of their migration route.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. <b>Amur</b> <b>falcons,</b> which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{photography}} has become a crucial tool in the mainstreaming of biodiversity and its conservation. Today, it would be almost impossible to find any conservation outreach or marketing materials that do not include {{at least a few}} photographs. This em-phasis on photographic material is well justified, as there is evidence that photographs can have an important im-pact in our perceptions, attitudes and even behaviour to-wards nature (Kalof, Zammit-Lucia and Kelly 2011; Myers Jr., 2006). Examples of this are the efforts of the Sierra Club to establish some of the world’s first pro-tected areas in the USA; National Geographic’s coverage of the “Megatransect ” trek by ecologist Michael Fay across the Congo basin; or the recent media reports on the large scale killing of <b>Amur</b> <b>Falcons</b> in the of Nagaland...|$|R
50|$|The wide {{breeding}} range and large population {{size of the}} <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> {{have led to the}} species being assessed as being of least concern. The flocking behaviour during migration and the density at which they occur, however, expose them to hunting and other threats. During their migration from their breeding area to the winter quarters, they are plump and are hunted for food in parts of northeastern India as well as in eastern Africa.In 2012, mass trapping and capture of migrating Amur falcons in Nagaland (India) was reported in the media and a successful campaign was begun to prevent their killing. As part of this campaign, three birds were fitted with 5 gm satellite transmitters that allowed them to be tracked during their migration.|$|E
50|$|Wokha's {{agglomeration}} {{consists of}} Wokha town, Longsa village, Wokha village and Vakhosung. It has a combined population of over 80,000. Wokha {{is on the}} main route from Kohima to Mokokchung {{and was one of}} the earliest locations of the Assam Rifles. The Government of Nagaland constructed a tourist lodge in Wokha Town. The annual <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> migration passes Doyang Dam, which is a 2-hour drive away. It also hosts the oldest cricket tournament in North East India, The Winter Cricket Challenge. The nearest railhead is Furkating Railway Station in Golaghat, Assam and the nearest airport is Dimapur Airport (IATA: DMU, ICAO: VEMR). Taxis and buses are available from every district headquarter in Nagaland to Wokha. There is a helicopter service from Dimapur.|$|E
50|$|The {{family has}} a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution across the world, absent only from the densest forest of central Africa, some remote oceanic islands, the high Arctic and Antarctica. Some species have exceptionally wide ranges, particularly the cosmopolitan peregrine falcon, which ranges from Greenland to Fiji and has the widest natural breeding distribution of any bird. Other species have more restricted distributions, particularly island endemics like the Mauritius kestrel. Most habitat types are occupied, from tundra to rainforest and deserts, although they are generally more birds of open country and even forest species tend to prefer broken forest and forest edges. Some species, mostly in the genus Falco, are fully migratory, with some species summering in Eurasia and wintering entirely in Africa, other species may be partly migratory. The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> {{has one of the}} longest migrations, moving from East Asia to southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco amurensis) {{is a small}} raptor of the falcon family. It breeds in {{south-eastern}} Siberia and Northern China before migrating {{in large}} flocks across India and over the Arabian Sea to winter in Southern Africa. It was earlier treated as a subspecies of the red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus) and known as the eastern red-footed falcon. Males are dark grey with reddish brown thighs and undertail coverts; reddish orange eye-ring, cere, and feet. Females are duller above, with dark scaly markings on white underparts, an orange eye ring, cere, and legs. Only a pale wash of rufous is visible on their thighs and undertail coverts. Their diet consists mainly of insects, such as termites; during migration over the sea, they are thought to feed on migrating dragonflies. The route that they take from Africa back to their breeding grounds is as yet unclear.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Amur</b> <b>falcon</b> breeds in east Asia {{from the}} Transbaikalia, Amurland, and {{northern}} Mongolian region {{to parts of}} North Korea. They migrate in a broad front through India and Sri Lanka, sometimes further east over Thailand and Cambodia and then over the Arabian Sea, sometimes in passage on the Maldives and other islands to reach southern Africa. Birds going over India {{are thought to be}} aided by strong winds blowing westward. These winds are strong at an altitude of about 3000m and the birds are thought to fly at a height of above 1000m during migration. The route taken to return to their breeding grounds is not clear, but they avoid the long ocean crossing and possibly take an overland route northward through Africa and {{to the west of the}} Himalayas. Vagrants have been recorded as far west as in Italy, Sweden, St. Helena and the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the earlier}} {{papers on the}} birds of Namdapha was {{published}} in 1990. The park has about 425 bird species with many more to be recorded from work in the higher areas. There are five species of hornbills recorded from the area. Several species of rare wren-babblers have been recorded in Namdapha. Other bird groups include laughing thrushes, parrotbills, fulvettas, shrike babblers and scimitar babblers. The snowythroated babbler is a rare species of babbler found only in the Patkai and Mishmi hills and nearby areas in Northern Myanmar, is found in Namdapha. Other rare, restricted range or globally endangered species include the rufous-necked hornbill, green cochoa, purple cochoa, beautiful nuthatch, Ward's trogon, ruddy kingfisher, blue-eared kingfisher, white-tailed fish eagle, Eurasian hobby, pied falconet, white-winged wood duck, Himalayan wood-owl, rufous-throated hill-partridge, and whitecheeked hill partridge. Several leaf warblers and migrants such as <b>amur</b> <b>falcon</b> and several thrushes can be seen here. The first mid-winter waterfowl census in Namdapha was conducted in 1994 when species such as the white-bellied heron, a critically endangered bird was recorded for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|The twelve {{important}} ornithological sites {{selected in}} Botswana of which seven are wetlands {{and which are}} recognized {{and supported by the}} BirdLife International known for their bird life cover more than 25% of the land surface of the country. These parks are: The Chobe National Park; the Linyanti Swamp along the Chobe River; the Okavango Delta, the Lake Ngami; the Makgadikgadi Pans; the Central Kalahari; the Manyelanong Hill; the Tswapong Hills; the Boka Dam; the Phakalane Sewage Lagoons; the Southeast Botswana; and the Gemsbok National Park. An initiative started by the IBA is of setting up 'Site Support Groups' (SSGs), an organised group of local people with the objective to [...] "sustain biodiversity to sustain livelihoods in rural Botswana"; there are 150 SSGs in important bird areas reported to be functioning throughout Africa. Red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), <b>amur</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco amurensis) and barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) and Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) are some of the birds reported by IBA from the grasslands, wetlands, hills, in areas of Kalahari Highveld, deltas and around lakes created by dams.|$|E
30|$|Avifauna on the {{mountain}} was sparse, with only twelve species recorded during the survey. Apart from raptors and two southern African endemics, these were mostly inconspicuous birds. Three of the raptors – Buteo vulpinus (Steppe Buzzard), Falco amurensis (<b>Amur</b> <b>Falcon)</b> and Milvus migrans (Yellow-billed Kite) – are non-breeding migrants and not confined to mountain regions (Hockey et al. 2005). No evidence (visual or audio) of Chaetops aurantius (Drakensberg Rockjumper) was noted, although the habitat is favourable. As the bird was recorded visually on the higher Koudeveldberge massif (20 km to north) in December 2011 by VRC, {{there is a chance}} that it may occur sporadically on these lower Kamdebooberg mountains. The greatest number of bird species were noted from the surrounding Karoo plains (not included in the Additional file 2 : Appendix 2), most spectacularly an influx of Neotis ludwigii (Lüdwig’s Bustard) feeding on the emergent insects during and after the heavy rains.|$|E
