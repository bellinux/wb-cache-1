50|$|The {{rifled barrel}} is {{fitted with a}} flash suppressor, which {{is also used to}} attach rifle grenades and a bayonet. The iron sights consist of a hooded {{foresight}} that can be corrected in elevation and an adjustable (windage only), rotating rear drum that contains four <b>apertures</b> with <b>settings</b> for firing at: 100, 300, 400 and 500 m. The receiver top surface can be used to mount adapters enabling the use of optics.|$|R
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1969, the FL lens replaced the R mount version, {{which in turn}} was superseded by its FD equivalent. Altogether, two variations (with two different <b>aperture</b> <b>settings)</b> were made in its short production life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>settings</b> {{are on a}} ring {{mounted on}} the left lens, {{apertures}} go from f/3.5 to f/16 with all whole f-stops marked. The shutter speed is set by a ring mounted on the right lens and includes B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100 and 1/200.|$|E
5000|$|Another K-mount lens, the A {{series of}} lenses saw the {{introduction}} of [...] "automatic" [...] <b>aperture</b> <b>settings.</b> The lenses had an aperture ring (unlike the later DA series), and thus the aperture could be set manually, but they also had an [...] "A" [...] mode, which allowed the camera to control the aperture automatically.|$|E

50|$|The sight {{arrangement}} on the Stoner 63/63A differs {{amongst the}} various configurations. On the belt-fed LMGs, the rear sights are {{mounted on the}} top cover. These consist of a folding leaf aperture elevation scale graduated in 100 m increments from 200 to 1,000 m. The rear sight can also be corrected for windage in ¼-mil increments. When the primary sight is folded down, a battle sight aperture with a diameter of 0.09 in is exposed. The Rifle and Carbine versions have simple flip-type <b>apertures</b> with <b>settings</b> for 0-300 and 300-500 m contained between large perforated protective ears. The sights are adjustable in both windage and elevation in 1 MOA increments. All variants share the same front sight assembly—a semi-shrouded round threaded post adjustable for windage and elevation zero (similar to the M16 front sight).|$|R
5000|$|It also {{features}} NightShot and NightFraming which removes the infrared cut-off filter from the CCD thus making the camera [...] "able {{to see in}} the dark" [...] and enabling two infrared LEDs illuminating the scene at short range. <b>Aperture</b> and similar <b>settings</b> are forced to auto and are limited (this might be due to the fact, {{that it was possible to}} photograph through thin clothing with an additional IR passing filter). Because of the limitations it's giving the opportunity to be used in IR photography only partly.|$|R
50|$|Based on Minolta XD-7 {{but with}} Leica {{developed}} exposure metering, mirror box, and newly designed body, the R4 followed the trend setting Olympus OM-1 and was much smaller and lighter than all earlier Leica SLR cameras.

50|$|The View-Master Personal Stereo Camera was a {{35mm film}} camera {{designed}} to take 3D stereo photos for viewing in a View-Master. First released in 1952, the camera took 69 pairs of photos on a 36 exposure roll 35mm film, taking one set while the film was unwound from the canister, and another set while it was rewound. Although focus was fixed, the camera supported both variable <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> and shutter speeds.|$|E

50|$|The {{aperture}} on {{the lens}} is set {{from the body}} by the same stop-down lever found on the original K-mount, but on KA-lenses this lever {{is proportional to the}} area of the aperture opening, rather than the diameter as on previous lenses. This allows the body to easily set a specific aperture, since the relationship to F stops is linear. The lenses add an 'A' setting on the aperture dial, which gives the body control of the <b>aperture.</b> Other, numeric <b>settings</b> are used for manual aperture modes—aperture priority and full manual mode.|$|R
40|$|The BESSY II [1] low {{emittance}} {{storage ring}} {{is based on}} 16 double bend achromats paired in groups of two. There are two sextupole families for chromatic optics corrections. Additional two pairs of two sextupole families are used for the harmonic sextupole correction. To find an optimum field excitation scheme a scanning routine was set up, to vary the field strength of the harmonic sextupoles and to record the corresponding lifetime and transverse beam dimension. The harmonic sextupoles could be readjusted yielding an increase of beam lifetime of about 30 %. We report on the experimental results compared with numerical simulations of the dynamic <b>aperture</b> for different <b>settings</b> of the harmonic sextupoles...|$|R
40|$|The {{hardcopy}} industry {{seeks to}} reproduce preferred representations of pictorial content. It {{is often difficult}} to reproduce the high dynamic range of real world scenes with the relatively low dynamic range of modern display and printing technology. This can lead to poor reproductions due to various limitations in sensing and rendering technology. For uncontrolled environments the automated capture <b>settings</b> (<b>aperture</b> and exposure time) can result in problems such as: under, over, flat, and bi-modal exposures. However, it is possible to design image processing algorithms, which can partially mitigate the effects of these limitations. In this paper, we define the tone correction problem and discuss one solution to produce preferred representations of pictorial content...|$|R
5000|$|The Coronet Twelve-20 - a {{box camera}} taking 6x6 cm format {{pictures}} on 120 film and 620 film.

50|$|The Reflex III of 1961 and Reflex IV of 1964 brought minor {{improvements}} {{with the}} former offering a metering needle visible in the finder, and the latter allowing shutter and <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> to be visible in the finder. The Reflex IV was produced until 1967. From 1968 to 1974 Kodak AG produced an Instamatic Reflex (SLR) based on the Retina Reflex, accepting the S series lenses, but using instamatic 126 film cartridges and instamatic style flash cubes.|$|E

The other Canon FD macro lenses achieve only a 1:2 (half life size) magnification without extension tubes and require the lens {{to be closer to}} the subject; on the other hand, the 200 mm's shallower depth of field at equivalent <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> can be limiting.|$|E
40|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is observable {{especially with}} wide angle lenses. This paper presents {{a study on}} chromatic aberration of two fisheye lenses. Both tested lenses produce images with obvious colour aberration. Four different mathematical models were tested to compensate the aberration of distinct colour channels; shift and scale, affine, projective and polynomial. The model parameters were obtained by registering the red and blue channels to the green one. The performed experiments revealed that shifting and scaling of the colour channels is adequate to compensate most of the chromatic aberration of tested fisheye lenses. It also turned out that same corrections can not be applied to different <b>aperture</b> and focus <b>settings.</b> Registering of the colour channels improved the image quality notably. 1...|$|R
5000|$|A few {{artifacts}} of APEX remain. Canon, Pentax and Leica cameras use 'Av' and 'Tv' to indicate relative aperture and shutter speed {{as well as}} to symbolize aperture priority and shutter priority modes. Some Pentax DSLRs even provide a 'TAv' exposure mode to automatically set the ISO speed depending on the desired <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>settings,</b> and 'Sv' (for sensitivity priority) to pre-set the ISO speed and let the camera choose the other parameters. Some meters, such as Pentax spot meters, directly indicate the exposure value for ISO 100 film speed. For a given film speed, exposure value is directly related to luminance, although the relationship depends on the reflected-light meter calibration constant [...] Most photographic equipment manufacturers specify metering sensitivities in EV at ISO 100 speed (the uppercase 'V' is almost universal).|$|R
2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] {{long sight}} radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains <b>apertures</b> with <b>settings</b> [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with windage and elevation increments of 1.5 mrad or [...] at 300 m. For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|R
50|$|Against this backdrop, the FM2 {{may have}} seemed an anachronism, yet it sold well. It was a reliable, durable {{mechanical}} camera {{in a time of}} ever-increasing electronic automation, and often, less durable construction. The FM2 was not designed for budget-minded snapshooters who would never bother to learn to utilize shutter-speeds and <b>aperture</b> <b>settings,</b> but rather was intended to appeal to serious photographers who demanded a tough, rugged camera. Nippon Kogaku believed that advanced photographers were not interested in every possible automated bell and whistle, but rather in high quality and precision worksmanship.|$|E
50|$|One of {{its main}} selling points is its Carl Zeiss {{photography}} features. It was Nokia's first camera phone to have an 8 megapixel sensor, and features both multiple <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> and a mechanical shutter (uncommon features {{by the standards of}} camera phones), and a Carl Zeiss lens with a wide angle of view (28 mm equivalent). It also has auto focus and a dual LED flash (3rd generation dual-LEDs), and an AF assist light. Video capture resolution is 640 × 480 pixels (VGA) at 30 frames per second.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{aperture}} setting {{switch on the}} camera with two positions indicated by pictorial ideograms: sunny and cloudy, with a nominal value of [...] and , respectively.

The problem is reported as having been fixed in cameras post-2009, providing two working <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> of [...] and , and earlier cameras are modifiable to provide two usable settings. [...] Apertures of [...] and [...] work well for ISO200 speed films, while settings of [...] and [...] tend to suit faster films of around ISO400.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design {{did not have}} an exposure control in the viewfinder. The camera had to be taken away from the eye view, to observe the needle on the light meter. (This in fact wasn't a real disadvantage, because to focus the user also had to take the camera to the same position. In normal lighting conditions, the exposure settings of a manual camera really only have to be changed after ten minutes or so, or when changing location. Nevertheless, an exposure control display in the viewfinder was considered very early at Rollei, but an analog display was discarded for limited space reasons, and light emitting diodes were not available at the time.) So not until summer of 1979 were the Rollei 35 TE and Rollei 35 SE released to the market. As the electronic exposure meter needed more power, a larger battery, of type PX-27 with 5.6 volts, was placed where the former instrument movement was mounted, The electronic circuit was built into the former battery compartment. Unlike the Rollei 35 LED theshutter position and <b>aperture</b> control <b>settings</b> were transferred, without any electrical contact wear and tear, using a differential gear turning a variable density filter in front of the CdS light sensor. The release button activated the light meter, when slightly depressed. Three LEDs in the viewfinder indicate the correct exposure. This system worked perfectly, yet earlier models are more in demand today.|$|R
40|$|Photo {{deblurring}} {{has been}} a major research topic in the past few years. So far, existing methods have focused on removing the blur due to camera shake and object motion. In this paper, we show that the optical system of the camera also generates significant blur, even with professional lenses. We introduce a method to estimate the blur kernel densely over the image and across multiple <b>aperture</b> and zoom <b>settings.</b> Our measures show that the blur kernel can have a non-negligible spread, even with top-of-the-line equipment, and that it varies nontrivially over this domain. In particular, the spatial variations are not radially symmetric and not even left-right symmetric. We develop and compare two models of the optical blur, each of them having its own advantages. We show that our models predict accurate blur kernels {{that can be used to}} restore photos. We demonstrate that we can produce images that are more uniformly sharp unlike those produced with spatially-invariant deblurring techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{digital camera}} {{revolution}} {{has changed the}} world of photography and now most people have access to, and even regularly carry, a digital camera. Often these cameras have been designed with simplicity in mind: they harness a variety of sophisticated technologies in order to automatically {{take care of all}} manner of complex <b>settings</b> (<b>aperture,</b> shutter speed, flash etc.) for point-and-shoot ease, these assistive features are usually incorporated directly into the cameras interface. However, {{there is little or no}} support for the end-user when it comes to helping them to compose or frame a scene. To this end we describe a novel recommendation process which uses a variety of intelligent and assistive interfaces to guide the user in taking relevant compositions given their current location and scene context. This application has been implemented on the Android platform and we describe its core user interaction, recommendation technologies and demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of real-world scenarios. Specifically we report on the results of a live-user trial of the technology in a real-world tourist setting...|$|R
50|$|The CATS flash {{equipment}} {{was for the}} later electronic Canon F1 New (1981) and it allowed <b>aperture</b> <b>settings</b> from the camera to be communicated to the flash unit. It was also possible for the flash unit to select an appropriate camera aperture based on its own photo cell exposure reading, provided that the motor drive was also present. The motor drive {{is necessary for the}} camera to function in shutter priority. TTL Flash was introduced on the Nikon F3 (1981) which was a direct competitor of the F1 New. For many this was considered as a considerable advantage although the ergonomics of the Nikon F3 with its liquid crystal display lacked the clarity of the Canon F1.|$|E
50|$|The Trip 35 was a {{point and}} shoot model with a 40mm f2.8 lens, solar-powered {{selenium}} light meter, and just two shutter speeds. In 'A' mode, the camera operated as a Program automatic, choosing either 1/40th sec or 1/200th sec. The camera could also sync with flash, and had a range of <b>aperture</b> <b>settings,</b> from f2.8 to f22. In flash sync mode the shutter was set at 1/40. Apart from a simple four-position zone focus system, and an ISO setting from 25-400, the camera had no other photographic controls. The camera had a Prontor-Compur sync connector and a hot shoe. Its lens was a coated Zuiko 40mm f/2.8, with four elements in three groups.|$|E
5000|$|The DA lenses were {{designed}} specifically for the Pentax digital cameras incorporating an APS-C digital sensor. As the APS-C sensor has a smaller surface area than 35mm film, these lenses are not {{generally considered to be}} compatible with older cameras. They also lack an aperture ring, limiting their use on cameras that do not support automatic <b>aperture</b> <b>settings.</b> Most of the DA zoom lenses are available in weather resistant (WR) versions to match the weather sealed capabilities of the medium to upper level Pentax DSLR camera bodies. While older models still have the in-body screw drive autofocus system, newer designs marked [...] "DC", [...] "SDM" [...] or [...] "PLM" [...] feature silent, in-lens autofocus motors.|$|E
50|$|The crop {{factor is}} {{used to compare the}} field of view and image quality of {{different}} cameras with the same lens. Multiplying a lens focal length by the crop factor gives the focal length of a lens that would yield the same field of view if used on the reference format. For example, a lens with a 50 mm focal length on an imaging area with a crop factor of 1.6 with respect to the reference format (usually 35 mm) will yield the same field of view that a lens with an 80 mm focal length will yield on the reference format. If it is desired to capture an image with the same field of view and image quality but different cameras, the <b>aperture</b> and ISO <b>settings</b> also need to be adjusted with respect to the crop factor. The focal length of the lens does not change by using a smaller imaging area; the field of view is correspondingly smaller because a smaller area of the image circle cast by the lens is used by the smaller imaging area.|$|R
40|$|Modern hadron {{machines}} with high beam intensity may suffer from material {{damage in the}} case of large beam losses and even beam-intercepting devices, such as collimators, can be harmed. A systematic method to evaluate thresholds of damage owing to the impact of high energy particles is therefore crucial for safe operation and for predicting possible limitations in the overall machine performance. For this, a three-step simulation approach is presented, based on tracking simulations followed by calculations of energy deposited in the impacted material and hydrodynamic simulations to predict the thermomechanical effect of the impact. This approach is applied to metallic collimators at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which in standard operation intercept halo protons, but risk to be damaged {{in the case of}} extraction kicker malfunction. In particular, tertiary collimators protect the <b>aperture</b> bottlenecks, their <b>settings</b> constrain the reach in β* and hence the achievable luminosity at the LHC experiments. Our calculated damage levels provide a very important input on how close to the beam these collimators can be operated without risk of damage. The results of this approach have been used already to push further the performance of the present machine. The risk of damage is even higher in the upgraded high-luminosity LHC with higher beam intensity, for which we quantify existing margins before equipment damage for the proposed baseline settings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Much {{research}} has emphasized stereo disparity {{as a source}} of depth information. To a lesser extent, camera vergence and lens focus have also been investigated for their utility in depth recovery. Each of these visual cues exhibits shortcomings when used individually in the sense that none alone can be used to reconstruct surfaces for real scenes that often cover a wide field of view and a large range of depth. This paper presents an approach to integration of these cues that attempts to exploit their complementary strengths and weaknesses through active control of camera focus and orientations. In addition, the <b>aperture</b> and zoom <b>settings</b> of the cameras are controlled. The result is an active vision system that dynamically and cooperatively interleaves image acquisition with surface estimation. A dense composite map of a single contiguous surface is synthesized by automatically scanning the surface and combining estimates of adjacent, local surface patches. This problem is formulated as one of minimizing a pair of objective functions. The first such function is concerned with the selection of a target for fixation. The second objective function guides the surface estimation process {{in the vicinity of the}} fixation point. Calibration parameters of the cameras are treated as variables during optimization, thus making camera calibration an integral, flexible component of surface estimation. An implementation of this method is described, and a performance evaluation of the system is presented. An average absolute error of less than 0. 15 % in estimated depth was achieved for a large surface having a depth of approximately 2 m.
