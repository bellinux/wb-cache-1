2500|$|Huckabee's media {{exposure}} {{continued to}} grow when he appeared on The Colbert Report on August 16 and the season premiere of Real Time with Bill Maher on August 24. Colbert jokingly attributed Huckabee's success in the Ames Straw Poll to [...] "the Colbert bump" [...] in reference to Huckabee's two prior appearances on the show while Maher remarked, [...] "Rudy Giuliani scares {{the hell out of}} me so I hope you win, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for you, on your birthday, is that this year a Republican dark horse could win." [...] The coverage from Colbert instigated the Who Made Huckabee? mock feud.|$|E
2500|$|Many Synod fathers {{stressed}} the need for the Church to speak in a tone that was positive, clear, simple, and which upheld the ideal family life as one that was obtainable. [...] Irish Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said that [...] "repeating doctrinal formulations alone will not bring the gospel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> of the family into an antagonistic society. We have to find a language which helps our young people to appreciate the newness and the challenge of the gospel." [...] Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge agreed, saying [...] "crude and bleak readings" [...] of modern society [...] "are not what the doctor ordered." ...|$|E

[...] Rather than inviting the devil into one by ignoring his presence in all the unbaptized, the Church proclaims boldly his overthrow (James 4:7), and reminds herself, and all her members, who our enemies truly are: the devil, the world, and, yes, even our own sinful flesh. [...] <b>And,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> that one dies with Christ, and rises to new life in Him with the Water and the Word, brings us comfort in our battles with our defeated enemies (Romans 6:4; 16:20)." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fourniers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> Club {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the school. [...] The club alleged that the school's denial of its {{application}} violated its free speech rights under the First Amendment, {{as well as its}} right to religious freedom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. [...] The club won a preliminary injunction allowing it to conduct its meetings at the school from April 1997 to August 1998. [...] In August 1998, however, the district court ruled against the club, finding that the club's [...] "subject matter is decidedly religious in nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that is otherwise permitted" [...] by the school. [...] Because the school forbade all religious instruction under its policy, the court ruled that it was not engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.|$|E

The toilette, I have reason to believe, was a success. Mr. Rowley dismissed me with a farewell: ‘Crikey! Mr. Anne, but you do look prime!’ Even the stony Bethiah was—how shall I say?—dazzled, but scandalised, by my appearance; and while, of course, she deplored the vanity that led to it, she could not wholly prevent herself from admiring the result.|$|E

Nchama Chamvu was at once sent off with a present of gin and a verbal report of arrival to Nessudikira Nchinu, (King), of Banza Nkaye, whilst we made ready for a night's lodging à la belle étoile.

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--You {{will have}} no letter at all this month and it is really not my fault. I have been saving my hand as much as {{possible}} for Davy Balfour; only this morning I was getting on first rate with him, when about half-past nine there came a prick {{in the middle of the}} ball of my thumb, and I had to take to the left hand and two words a minute. I fear I slightly exaggerate the speed of my left hand; about a word and a half in the minute--which is dispiriting to the last degree. Your last letter with the four excellent reviews <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> about The Wrecker was particularly welcome. I have already written to Charles Baxter about the volume form appearance of The Beach of Falesá. In spite of bad thumbs and other interruptions I hope to send to Baxter by this mail the whole first part (a good deal more than half) of David Balfour ready for press. This is pretty satisfactory, and I think ought to put us beyond the reach of financial catastrophe for the year.|$|E
60|$|Sir John {{being passed}} without the trench, meets Captain Forbes with some prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> of the enemy's retreat. He sends him {{directly}} to the king, who was by this time {{at the head of}} his army, in full battalia, ready to follow his vanguard, expecting a hot day's work of it. Sir John sends messenger after messenger to the king, entreating him to give him orders to advance; but the king would not suffer him, for he was ever upon his guard, and would not venture a surprise; so the army continued on this side the Lech all day and the next night. In the morning the king sent for me, and ordered me to draw out 300 horse, and a colonel with 600 horse, and a colonel with 800 dragoons, and ordered us to enter the wood by three ways, but so as to be able to relieve one another; and then ordered Sir John Hepburn with his brigade to advance {{to the edge of the}} wood to secure our retreat, and at the same time commanded another brigade of foot to pass the bridge, if need were, to second Sir John Hepburn, so warily did this prudent general proceed.|$|E
