5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} Sam sold {{the bar to}} a corporation, the place caters to a more {{up-market}} clientele. Eddie Lebec turns up and is surprised when Carla Tortelli tells him she is pregnant (incorporated by actress Rhea Perlman's real-life pregnancy). Sam Malone then returns to the bar after his attempt to sail around the world failed at the first hurdle when his sailboat ran ashore in the Caribbean. Though Cheers has new management, Woody Boyd and Carla are still employed at the bar, but they're now required to wear uniforms, much to their chagrin. Sam then <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> a job, but the bar already has two bartenders, Woody and a new employee, Wayne. Diane Chambers' attempts at writing her novel {{are said to have}} failed, which led to her leaving Boston to write in Hollywood.|$|E

30|$|We <b>also</b> <b>need</b> the {{following}} concepts.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} fact is <b>also</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The TRIM command <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> {{the support}} of the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E

25|$|Leadership {{development}} {{can build on}} the development of individuals (including followers) to become leaders. In addition, it <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to focus on the interpersonal linkages in the team.|$|E
25|$|Like Canada, Norway <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to use {{satellite}} communications for operations {{north of the}} Arctic Circle, a capability not to be delivered with the first batch of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|MOLAP {{generally}} delivers {{better performance}} due to specialized indexing and storage optimizations. MOLAP <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> less storage space compared to ROLAP because the specialized storage typically includes compression techniques.|$|E

25|$|Role and {{responsibilities}} of the board: The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.|$|E
25|$|GWI {{plans to}} {{rationalize}} its tariff system. Any modification in tariffs {{needs to be}} approved by the Public Utilities Commission. In addition, due to the political sensitivity of water tariffs, any modification de facto <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be approved by}} Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|When the {{practical}} exam is completed by a 17-year-old, {{he or she}} <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> a pass to get their licence. The pass includes {{the name of the}} driver and the name(s) of the supervisors: only the supervisors named on the pass can supervise.|$|E

25|$|The initial scoring {{matrix of}} Smith–Waterman {{algorithm}} enables the alignment of any segment of one sequence to an arbitrary {{position in the}} other sequence. In Needleman–Wunsch algorithm, however, end gap penalty <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be considered in}} order to align the full sequences.|$|E
25|$|A crisis {{assessment}} <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to {{be completed}} which consists of gathering information regarding the individual's crisis state, environment, and interpersonal relationships {{in order to work}} towards resolving the current crisis. This step helps facilitate development of an effective and appropriate treatment plan.|$|E
25|$|Food {{packaging}} {{should no}} longer contain any organic matter (organic matter, if any, needs {{to be placed in}} a biodegradable waste bin or be buried in a garden). Since no trace of biodegradable material is best kept in the packaging before placing it in a trash bag, some packaging <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to be rinsed.|$|E

30|$|Emergency services, such as fire, {{search and}} rescue, hospitals, and {{international}} help organizations will <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to provide much needed assistance to help victims in a catastrophe.

25|$|A {{chronic disease}} {{in which a}} person craves drinks that contain alcohol and is unable to control his or her drinking.

Alcoholism affects physical and mental health, and can cause problems with family, friends, and work.|$|E
25|$|Morocco faces {{challenges}} on human development outcomes despite progress {{over the past}} decade, in particular. Overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity in access to secondary education remain high and the country continues to suffer poor outcomes on infant and maternal mortality. It <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> to diversify its economy, become more competitive, and integrate further {{into the global economy}} if it is to reach higher growth levels.|$|E
25|$|Bäckman admires Vladmir Putin, {{crediting}} all recent {{successes of}} Russia to Putin's personality and health. He has compared Putin to Cold War-era Finnish president Urho Kekkonen, and claimed he wishes Putin would likewise rule Russia for 26 years. He stated that Finland <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> {{organizations such as}} the pro-Kremlin Nashi and Walking Together. According to Bäckman, the freedom of the press in Russia is considerably higher than in Finland, and Estonia is not free at all.|$|E
