5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.|$|E

[...] In these experiments, caged dogs were shocked with electricity in a random way in order to completely break their will to resist. Mitchell believed that Zubaydah must be treated [...] "like a dog in a cage."

25|$|When he was born, {{his parents}} were living with his mother's mother in Isestraße. After her death in October 1925, {{the family moved to}} a rented flat in a new {{building}} in Lattenkamp, in the Winterhude quarter. He attended a kindergarten then, in April 1930, moved to Alsterdorfer Straße School. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> had a new teacher, a National Socialist, who picked on him and punished him without cause. Thus in 1931 he moved to the Meerweinstraße School where his mother taught.|$|E
25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> had quite a collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E

Believing {{that he was}} to be drafted by the US Military and that he would once again face a prison term for refusing, Cancel Miranda {{followed}} the advice of his wife and his sister Zoraida and went into a self exile in Cuba. Cancel Miranda arrived in the city of Santiago using a different identity, Rafael Rodríguez. Cuba at that time was governed by Carlos Prío Socarrás. He moved to Havana where, with the help of Albizu Campos' son, Pedro Albizu Meneses, he found a job with the Public Works Department. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> {{went to work for the}} Raymond Concrete Pipe Co. which was building the Línea Street Tunnel, which connects the two banks of the Almendares River.|$|E

25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar {{if he had not}} promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E
500|$|With {{respect to}} Smith's {{decision}} not to return to film a sequel, Emmerich told Screen Crush that: [...] "In the very beginning, I {{wanted to work with}} him and he was excited to be in it but then <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was tired of sequels, and he did another science fiction film, which was his father-son story After Earth, so he opted out." ...|$|E
500|$|The film premiered in late 1972 at {{the third}} Annual Baltimore Film Festival, held {{on the campus of}} the University of Baltimore, where it sold out tickets for three {{successive}} screenings; the film aroused particular interest among underground cinema fans following the success of Multiple Maniacs, which had begun to be screened in New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Being picked up by the small independent company New Line Cinema, Pink Flamingos was distributed to Ben Barenholtz, the owner of the Elgin Theater in New York City. At the Elgin Theater, Barenholtz had been promoting the midnight movie scene, primarily by screening Alejandro Jodorowsky's acid western film El Topo (1970). Barenholtz felt that being of an avant-garde nature, Pink Flamingos would fit in well with this crowd, screening it at midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. The film soon gained a cult following at the Elgin Theatre. Barenholtz characterized its early fans as primarily being [...] "downtown gay people, more of the hipper set," [...] but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> noted that this group broadened, with the film becoming popular with [...] "working-class kids from New Jersey who would become a little rowdy". Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the film's lines, reciting them at the screenings, a phenomenon which became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his reasons for abandoning his musical career in an {{interview}} in the book accompanying his CD box set (released in 2000), he cited a simple lack of interest, a distaste for touring, and boredom with performing the same songs repeatedly. He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> simply lost interest. Although Lehrer was [...] "a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left", covering its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the New Left's opposition to the Vietnam war, he disliked the aesthetics of 1960s counterculture and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> suggested I come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we {{were out on the}} road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Book of , Sarah, {{the wife}} of Abraham, [...] "died in Kiryat-arba; the same is Hebron {{in the land of}} Canaan". Abraham the Hebrew (Avraham Ha-Ivri) was tending to {{business}} elsewhere when she died, at the age of 127 years, and he [...] "came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her." [...] (Genesis 23:2) <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> stood up and spoke to the [...] "sons of Heth" [...] and requested they give him a possession as a [...] "burying place", and they offered him his [...] "choice" [...] of their sepulchres.

Abraham then requested that Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, give him the cave of Machpelah, in the end of his field, [...] "for as much money as it is worth". (verse 9) After Ephron confirmed that he would give the cave, in verse 11, Abraham further requested that he give him the field for money, in verse 13. Ephron agreed and named a price.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835 Edgar Allan Poe {{published}} a short story, [...] "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall" [...] {{in which a}} flight to the moon in a balloon is described. It has {{an account of the}} launch, the construction of the cabin, descriptions of strata and many more science-like aspects. In addition to Poe's account the story written in 1813 by the Dutch Willem Bilderdijk is remarkable. In his novel Kort verhaal van eene aanmerkelijke luchtreis en nieuwe planeetontdekking (Short account of a remarkable journey into the skies and discovery of a new planet) Bilderdijk tells of a European somewhat stranded in an Arabic country where he boasts he is able to build a balloon that can lift people and let them fly through the air. The gasses used turn out to be far more powerful than expected and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> lands on a planet positioned between earth and moon. The writer uses the story to portray an overview of scientific knowledge concerning the moon in all sorts of aspects the traveller to that place would encounter. Quite a few similarities {{can be found in the}} story Poe published some twenty years later.|$|E
2500|$|Looking at {{the leading}} group, it was {{reasonable}} {{to think that}} Ballan, Le Mével or Popovych was going to attack sooner or later, as Freire is a top-class sprinter and would probably beat them all if {{they went to the}} finish line together. Yaroslav Popovych was the first to attack and immediately the French got disappointed as Christophe Le Mével dropped and never managed to come back. Alessandro Ballan however closed the gap and brought Óscar Freire back in his wheel. It was then Freire's turn to attack, but again Ballan closed the gap and now brought back Popovych. Popovych and Freire both took turns in attacking but Ballan seemed to be the strongest as he closed the gap every time. However, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was also getting tired and could not respond to yet another attack by Popovych. He did not get any help from Freire in closing the gap and so Popovych won the stage. Freire knew he did not deserve the second place and left it to Ballan; however, this could cost him the green jersey in the end. Le Mével finished as fourth and in the peloton it was Tom Boonen who convincingly won the sprint for the fifth place, 4'25" [...] behind Popovych.|$|E
60|$|Rollo found, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> that <b>he</b> did {{not need}} the strapmen; so he let Josie have them both. Josie put his staff through the loops of the straps, and {{took hold of the}} ends of it, while the men walked before him, and pulled him up the rocks.|$|R
