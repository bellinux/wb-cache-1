50|$|The {{reign of}} Edward I is notable for three leading statutes, all {{passed in the}} {{interests}} of the superior lords. The 1279 the Statute of Mortmain was the first of a long series directed against the acquisition of land by religious and charitable corporations. In 1285 the statute De Donis Conditionalibus forbade the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs of his body, which before the statute usually became on the birth of an heir at once alienable, and so the lord lost his escheat. The statute Quia Emptores preserved those rights of the lords which were up to that time subject to be defeated by subinfeudation, by enacting that in any alienation of lands the <b>alienee</b> should hold them of the same lord of the fee as the alienor. Since 1290 it has been impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be held of a mesne lord, or to reserve a rent upon a grant of an estate in fee (unless in the form of a rent-charge), or to create a new manor. The statute, however, does not bind the crown. The practical effect of the statute was to make the transfer of land thenceforward more of a commercial and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of elegit was introduced by the Statute of Westminster II in 1285 as a creditor's remedy over real estate. It has, however, been considerably modified by subsequent legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Special {{provision}} {{is made for}} the collection of duty {{in the cases of}} joint tenants and where the successor is also the predecessor. The duty is a first charge on property, but if the property be parted with before the duty is paid the liability of the successor is transferred to the <b>alienee.</b> It is, therefore, usual in requisitions on title before conveyance, to demand {{for the protection of the}} purchaser the production of receipts for succession duty, as such receipts are an effectual protection notwithstanding any suppression or misstatement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed or any insufficiency of such assessment. The duty is by this act directed to be assessed as follows: on personal property, if the successor takes a limited estate, the duty is assessed on the principal value of the annuity or yearly income estimated according to the period during which he is entitled to receive the annuity or yearly income, and the duty is payable in four yearly instalments free from interest. If the successor takes absolutely he pays in a lump-sum duty on the principal value. On real property the duty is payable in eight half-yearly instalments without interest on the capital value of an annuity equal to the annual value of the property. Various minor changes were made. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 exempted personal estates under 300. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888 charged an additional 1% on successions already paying 1% and an additional 11% on successions paying more than 1%. By the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889, an additional duty of 1% called an [...] "estate duty" [...] was payable on successions over 10,000.|$|E
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether, after {{the transfer of}} a business from an entrepreneur to another, the creditors of bankrupted clients should file claw-back suit against the alienator or the <b>alienee.</b> The article investigates the matter considering both cases in which nothing has been agreed by the parties of the transfer and cases {{in which they have}} established that such obligations should be transferred on the <b>alienee</b> together with the business. Special attention is devoted, {{in the second half of}} the article, to cases involving the transfer of bank branches, as they are the most common in courts and they are regulated by a different set of rules in Italian law...|$|E
