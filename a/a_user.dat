By looking at <b>a</b> <b>users</b> habits and idiosyncrasies we determined the likelihood of <b>a</b> <b>users</b> location within known stay regions which we call habitats. The features used to determine location were extracted from <b>a</b> <b>users</b> interaction with the smart phone. None of the features contained <b>a</b> <b>users</b> locations or <b>a</b> <b>users</b> proximity to objects with known locations. Using a set of structured output support vector learning techniques we found that <b>a</b> <b>users</b> location {{with respect to the}} areas of typical activities is well predictable solely from daily routines and a smart phone usage habits...|$|R
5000|$|Foursquare 8.0 {{uses its}} own {{proprietary}} technology called Pilgrim to detect <b>a</b> <b>user's</b> location.

50|$|Advertisers {{may also}} deliver ads based on <b>a</b> <b>user's</b> {{suspected}} geography through geotargeting. <b>A</b> <b>user's</b> IP address communicates some geographic information (at minimum, the user's country or general region).

For example, with mobile devices, advertisers can sometimes use a phone's GPS receiver or the location of nearby mobile towers.

For example, <b>a</b> <b>user’s</b> gender could be predictive of how they use Twitter and, hence, how valuable their tweets are for social sensing. At the same time, Twitter-intrinsic “demographics” such as the age of the account or the number of followers possibly gives a better signal for how the user uses Twitter.
