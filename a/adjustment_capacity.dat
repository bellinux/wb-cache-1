40|$|AbstractUnder the {{circumstances}} of uncertain fluctuation of market demand, the degree of matching between production capacity and customers demand can affect the cost, the efficiency and the profits of an enterprise. Choosing the appropriate production capacity level is an important task for decision makers. The paper analyzes the characters of the short-term demand variation, the matching between the capacity and the demand, and its influence on the enterprise. Supposing the short-term demand varies seasonally, and the objective is minimum the loss of mismatch between the production capacity and market demand. Then,short-term production capacity decision model has been developed. Based on the model, this paper has probed into the mismatching loss of three strategies: fixed capacity strategy, subsection <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> strategy and dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> strategy,and an optimal capacity strategy is provided. By fixing the capacity-demand mismatching loss and changing the capacity adjustment rate, this paper also studies {{the sensitivity of the}} capacity strategy. The result shows that, firstly, as the capacity adjustment rate is less than a certain numerical value, the dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> is the optimal choice; secondly, as the capacity adjustment rate exceeds a certain numerical value, the optimal one is fixed capacity strategy; finally, as the rate falls in some specific area, the optimal one is subsection <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> strategy.

The analysis starts from {{the comparison of}} intensity of structural changes, as an introductory (quantitative) concept measuring structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity.</b> Besides the intensity of structural changes, the need for developing adequate tools evaluating the qualitative aspects of structural changes has been stressed. The analysis starts from presentation of alternative theoretical concepts of technology change, with special regard to its industry and firm specific aspects. The qualitative criteria of industry structure include: material and immaterial type of inputs, level of technology intensity, market concentration and product differentiation, and skills intensity.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} life goal {{characteristics}} and goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> {{of persons with}} lower limb amputation on admission to rehabilitation, and to examine their efficacy as predictors of psychosocial outcomes 6 months post-discharge. Design: Prospective, descriptive. Setting: Two specialist inpatient rehabilitation facilities in Ireland. Subjects: A consecutive sample of 64 patients with lower limb amputation. Main measures: On admission to rehabilitation, life goal characteristics (goal importance, goal disturbance) were assessed using the Goal Facilitation Index and goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> (goal disengagement, goal re-engagement) were measured using the Goal Adjustment Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales-Revised assessed depressive symptomatology and psychosocial adjustment to amputation at 6 months post-discharge. Results: The highest average importance ratings were assigned to goals associated with interpersonal relationships, independence, and subjective well-being. Goals related to physical limitations and disruptions in daily activities received the highest hindrance ratings. Goal importance (β = - 0. 33) and goal disengagement (β = - 0. 29) on admission significantly predicted depressive symptomatology 6 months post-discharge (p ≤. 05). Goal importance (β = 0. 32), goal disturbance (β = - 0. 26), and goal re-engagement (β = - 0. 21) on admission significantly predicted general adjustment to lower limb amputation at 6 months post-discharge (p ≤. 05), while goal importance (β = - 0. 32) and goal disturbance (β = 0. 30) significantly predicted social adjustment (p ≤. 05).

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{physical}} illness {{can contribute to}} depressive symptoms in the elderly. In turn, depression can also have a detrimental impact on physical health. This reciprocal relationship may produce a downward spiral, characterized by low subjective well-being and subsequent health declines. An important facet contributing to psychological well-being is the attainment of daily- and life-goals. However, the experience of acute physical symptoms (APS) may hinder the pursuit of these goals. In such circumstances, individuals' goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> can help maintain {{a sense of control}} and prevent the experience of negative emotions that stem from the constraints on goal attainment. Specifically, goal disengagement can protect individuals from the negative effect of failure, while goal reengagement can help individuals maintain a sense of purpose in life. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the short-term relations between APS and negative affect in 215 older adults. The experience of APS was expected to contribute to same-day negative affect and to an increase in negative affect across three normal days. No reciprocal impact of negative affect on APS was anticipated. Furthermore, it was expected that goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> would buffer the negative effects of APS on emotional well-being. The results demonstrated that APS predicted both same-day and an increase in negative emotions across days.

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined psychological {{factors that can}} contribute to subjective well-being among 147 individuals who are the primary caregivers of family members with mental illness. It was hypothesized that adaptive personality constructs and the personality profiles they create would predict higher levels of subjective well-being by facilitating coping with caregiving stress. In addition, it was investigated whether caregiving burden would mediate the associations between personality constructs, coping, and well-being, or whether personality would moderate the associations between burden, coping, and well-being. The personality constructs included goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> (goal disengagement and goal reengagement, Wrosch, Scheier, Miller, Schulz, & Carver, 2003), dispositional optimism (Scheier & Carver, 1987), and unmitigated communion (Helgeson & Fritz, 1998). Indicators of well-being included positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and purpose in life. The cross-sectional and longitudinal results indicated that goal disengagement, goal reengagement, and optimism predicted higher levels of several indicators of subjective well-being. Unmitigated communion was associated only with negative affect and depressive symptoms. Caregiver burden was negatively associated with goal disengagement and optimism, but positively with goal reengagement, and explained some {{of the effects of}} these personality constructs. Moreover, goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> predicted improved well-being among highly burden participants, while optimism was associated with higher well-being among their less burdened counterparts. In addition, some personality profiles, created by interactions between the three personality constructs, were meaningfully associated with subjective well-being. Finally, certain coping behaviors were associated with goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> and optimism but not with unmitigated communion. Effective and less useful care-specific coping mediated the effects of goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> and optimism on participants’ subjective well-being. Overall, the study’s findings suggest that different personality constructs can influence the subjective well-being of individuals caring for mentally ill family members. Moreover, many of these effects could be statistically explained by the way individuals cope with caregiving stress. These findings have important implications for theories of personality functioning and adjustment to stressful life circumstances. In addition, they illuminate pathways to subjective well-being, which has important practical implications for helping caregivers manage their difficult life circumstances and improve their quality of life. ...|$|R

The study finds that there is an important case for improving {{the rule of law and}} the quality of public services in general in the fight against very low participation and employment rates in the region, as well as very high unemployment. Wages, with some exceptions in specific sectors, do not seem to be mis-aligned with respect to productivity developments.

Further, goal reengagement was positively associated with challenge appraisals, which in turn was linked to task-oriented coping, and task-oriented coping positively associated with well-being.

The role that personal values play in the subjective well-being (SWB) of recent retirees was also investigated. It was hypothesized that achievement and power values would be perceived as lower after retirement, and that benevolence and universalism values would be perceived as higher after retirement. It was also hypothesized that goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity</b> (GA) would predict the degree of reported difference between current and retrospective pre-retirement values. The pattern of relations among values and SWB for retirees was expected to differ from previous research findings based on younger adult samples. Self-report measures of current and pre-retirement values, GA, SWB, and demographics were administered to 385 recent retirees. HLM analyses revealed that differences between current and retrospective values were in the predicted directions. Age, education, and GA influenced achievement value ratings; gender influenced benevolence and universalism ratings; and power values were associated with education. Differences between current and perceived pre-retirement values were not explained by goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacity.</b> Regression analyses revealed that positive affect was predicted by reports of higher benevolence, self-direction, and stimulation values and negative affect was predicted by higher tradition and achievement values and lower self-direction values.

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether within-person changes {{of breast cancer}} survivors’ high-arousal negative affect (e. g., feeling scared, upset, anxious, or guilty) could predict high levels of diurnal cortisol secretion and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). In addition, goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> (goal disengagement and goal reengagement) were expected to buffer the effect of negative affect on cortisol and to increase its effect on MVPA. Methods: High-arousal negative affect, self-reported MVPA, area-under-the-curve of diurnal cortisol secretion, and goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> were assessed in a longitudinal sample of 145 female breast cancer survivors. Results: Based on hierarchical linear modeling, breast cancer survivors reported increased levels of both MVPA and cortisol secretion if they experienced higher (as compared to lower) levels of high-arousal negative affect than their personal average. Furthermore, within-person negative affect was associated with: (i) higher MVPA among participants with high (but not low) goal reengagement capacities, and (ii) elevated cortisol secretion among participants with low (but not high) goal reengagement capacities. Conclusions: High-arousal negative affect may exert differing functions among breast cancer survivors in that it can trigger adaptive health behaviors, yet simultaneously elevate diurnal cortisol secretion. In addition, being able to engage in new goals may be {{a necessary condition for}} breast cancer survivors to experience the beneficial behavioral effects of high-arousal negative affect, and it may prevent the adverse effect of negative affect on enhanced cortisol output...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{disability}} is {{a common}} age-related problem that has deleterious effects on {{the well-being of the}} elderly population. Such disabilities can contribute to a loss of perceived control and autonomy by impeding older adults’ ability to accomplish both daily goals (i. e., activities of daily living [ADLs]), and other longer-term life pursuits. However, theory and research also suggest that older individuals may avoid the negative consequences of functional disability if they engage in the adaptive self-regulation of unattainable goals. The present studies investigate the role of goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> in the management of functional disability, and identify pathways through which goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> can influence well-being. Study 1 consists of a longitudinal investigation into the associations between older adults’ goal disengagement and goal reengagement capacities, functional disability, and depressive symptoms among 135 community-dwelling older adults. Using four waves of data, results showed that six-year increases in depressive symptoms were predicted by poor goal disengagement capacities and high levels of functional disability. Moreover, the impact of goal disengagement on depressive symptomatology was particularly strong among participants with functional disability. These findings indicate that goal disengagement can buffer the association between functional disability and increases in depressive symptomatology over time. Study 2 investigates the specific goal adjustment processes involved in the adjustment to ADL-related goals that are constrained by functional disability. This study first developed and validated the Activities of Daily Living – Goal Adjustment Scale among 135 community-dwelling older adults, with and without functional disability. Factor analyses identified two separate factors as psychological disengagement and compensatory reengagement, and the scale exhibited good internal consistency and validity among older adults with functional disability. The second part of the study found that these specific ADL-related goal adjustment strategies mediated the cross-sectional relationships between general goal <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> (i. e., goal disengagement and goal reengagement) and depressive symptoms in this population. These findings suggest that general tendencies to adjust to unattainable goals can exert both direct and indirect effects on depressive symptoms through the specific regulation of ADL-related problems. Overall, these findings contribute to the literature on pathways to successful aging. Findings on the adaptive role of goal adjustment in the management of functional disability are discussed in the context of developmental theories and adaptive self-regulation...|$|R

It integrates two control mechanisms: (i) input control, {{to regulate the}} inflow of work to the system; and (ii) output control, which uses <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments</b> to regulate the outflow of work from the system. Much Workload Control {{research has focused on}} input control, while output control has been largely neglected. Only recently has research emerged that uses Workload Control theory to guide <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Yet this literature focuses on <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments</b> (output control) only – it fails to integrate it with Workload Control’s input control element. In response, this study explores the performance impact of Workload Control when input control (controlled order release) and output control (<b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments)</b> are combined. Job shop simulation results demonstrate that input and output control can and should play complementary roles. Both elements significantly enhance performance in isolation, and performance effects appear to complement each other. Further, results indicate that the choice of the workload threshold that triggers <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments</b> has a stronger impact on performance than the actual size of the adjustment. The measure of workload used to guide the load-based order release decision is also used to determine the workload threshold that triggers the <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment.</b> This facilitates implementation in practice.

On the other hand, we find negative correlations between these variables and volatility. Testing different types of models we find very robust results, suggesting that countries with more developed domestic financial markets are in better conditions to recover growth after a shock.

These adverse effects include a moderate negative impact of increases in temperature on agricultural output and for low income countries also negative effects of reductions in precipitation and of increases {{in the frequency of}} droughts. The latter two effects are particularly strong in Sub-Sahara Africa where low-tech rain-fed agriculture with very limited climate change <b>adjustment</b> <b>capacities</b> dominates. Thus, our findings reinforce the importance of proper adaptation strategies to climate change considering heterogeneous production technologies across countries...|$|R
