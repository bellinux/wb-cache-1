30|$|In [45], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} a multi-objective ACO {{to solve the}} problem of VM placement. The formulated multi-objective VM placement problem represented a permutation of VM assignment. The goal was to efficiently obtain a set of non-dominated solutions that reduced total power consumption resulting from resource wastage. This proposed model has two phases; Initialization phase: where the parameters and the pheromone trails were initialized. Iterative phase: in this phase, all VM requests were sent <b>to</b> the <b>ants</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> assigning VMs <b>to</b> the selected PMs. This was done by using a pseudo-random-proportional rule, which described the way each ant selected a particular next one VM pack into its current PM. Ants moved towards the most promising VMs based on information about the current pheromone concentration during the movement. Local and global pheromones were frequently updated. A local pheromone update was performed once an artificial ant built a movement. Then, a global update was performed with each solution of the current Pareto set after all ants had constructed their solutions.|$|R

Oakey had avoided revealing this at the time for fear of offending the song's subject. The song could be viewed as a reference to the 1971 Japanese TV series Mirrorman.|$|R
40|$|Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a Meta {{heuristic}} {{combinatorial optimization}} technique. Ant Colony System (ACS) is the algorithm in the ACO. This {{is based on}} the behavior of <b>ants.</b> Many <b>ants</b> <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> search food from the nest and travel some distance. In that time some <b>ants</b> goes <b>to</b> search food in some ways. At last all ants reach the destination point that way will be the shortest path. This is done by the pheromone updating. The leading ant deposits the pheromone while moving, the upcoming ants follows the leading ant by the chemical where it is high. This process is repeated until an optimal combination of ant’s solution is reached. Based on this concept we implement the algorithm to solve the real time problems like routing, assignment, scheduling. Keyword’s-Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), cloud computing, workflow scheduling.

Harry also steals some <b>ant</b> farms <b>to</b> unleash on Pearl's ship, because the ants are Martian metal-eating ants. Upon releasing the <b>ants,</b> they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> eat at Pearl's ship, getting as far one last bit of the roof, forcing the whole crew to stand on it. Mighty Mouse saves them by creating a picnic, which the ants can't resist, and Pearl reveals that since they always carry a spare, she rebuilds the ship by stomping on a buzzer. It regenerates and the crew falls back in.|$|R
40|$|Most {{electronic}} manufacturing industries use computer numerical controlled (CNC) {{machines for}} drilling holes on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). Some machines do not choose the optimal route when completing their tasks. Hence, this paper proposes an approach, {{which is based on}} ant colony system (ACS), for finding the optimal route in PCB holes drilling process. In ACS, an artificial <b>ant</b> <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> move from a random hole location and moves to the next hole location, based on the pheromone level between the locations of two holes. The higher the pheromones level, the higher the chance for the artificial <b>ant</b> <b>to</b> choose that path. At the same time, that ant deposits its pheromone on the path chosen. This process is repeated until the artificial ant builds a solution, which is evaluated with other artificial ants’ solutions. The best artificial ant deposits additional pheromone to its path. The best-found path is updated as the iteration continues. Experimental result indicates that the proposed ACS-based approach is capable to efficiently find the optimal route for PCB holes drilling process...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ant</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> become {{interested}} in DJing {{at a very young}} age. He would watch his father DJ in the army while he would picture himself as Grandmaster Flash. Years later he would <b>start</b> <b>to</b> use producing and DJing as much more than a hobby. The first CD that he worked on was Comparison by Beyond, later known by Sab the Artist, in 1996. While producing that album, he met Sean Daley (Slug) and they later worked together. With one exception (Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs), Ant has produced every Atmosphere album in full. He also works with various artists that are a part of Rhymesayers Entertainment (including full production of three Brother Ali albums) and many more. After finishing his 5th studio album with Atmosphere he was previously on tour promoting.|$|R
40|$|Foraging desert <b>ants</b> return <b>to</b> their <b>starting</b> point, the nest, {{by means}} of path integration. If the path-integration vector has been run off but the nest {{has not yet been}} reached, the ants engage in {{systematic}} search behavior. This behavior results in a system of search loops of ever increasing size and finally leads to a search density profile peaking at the location where the path integration system has been reset to zero. In this study we investigate whether this systematic search behavior is adapted to the uncertainty resulting from the preceding foraging run. We show first that the longer the distances of the foraging excursions, the larger the errors occurring during path integration, and second that the ants adapt their systematic search strategy to their increasing uncertainty by extending their search pattern. Hence, the density of the systematic search pattern is correlated with the ants' confidence in their path integrator. This confidence decreases with increasing foraging distances...|$|R
