5|$|Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies {{would be}} a theme of Donen's next film: Movie Movie, {{produced}} by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment and scripted by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller.

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: a {{compound}} of Eofor-, from the old name, and -wic a village probably by conflation of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> English word for wild swine, which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, it sounded as a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E
