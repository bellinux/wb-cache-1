5|$|After {{watching}} a news {{report on the}} cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who take him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E

After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why the survivors <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest <b>are</b> <b>dying,</b> alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E
5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin <b>are</b> <b>dying,</b> {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that when using CAPP-Seq on ctDNA it still currently not known whether ctDNA is released at equal rates from primary tumors and metastatic disease, so this should be taken into consideration.

It is also unknown how tumor histology affects ctDNA release.|$|E

Similarly, the culture is also ill-equipped to deal with the news that a previously hyped treatment or screening procedure has been determined to be ineffective, with women advocating for the acceptance and promotion of inexpedient activities and inefficient or even sometimes harmful drugs.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world {{and may not}} be able to adapt to life in the wild. Captive breeding also promises to reduce incentives to capture wild orcas. However, in January 2002 the Miami Seaquarium stated that captive orcas <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> faster than they are being born, and as it is virtually impossible to obtain orcas captured from the wild, the business of exhibiting captive orcas may eventually disappear.|$|E
25|$|Coral reefs <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> {{around the}} world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. A 2014 study lists {{factors such as}} population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas, global warming and invasive species among the main reasons that have put reefs in danger of extinction.|$|E
25|$|The stages model, {{which came}} {{about in the}} 1960s, is a theory based on {{observation}} of people who <b>are</b> <b>dying,</b> not people who experienced {{the death of a}} loved one. This model found empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al. The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show {{that the vast majority of}} people who have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient. The logic is that if there is no grief, there are no stages to pass through.|$|E

25|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} therapy {{may prove}} to be beneficial for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders that result in the degeneration of body cells, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Monoclonal antibody therapy can aid the immune system because the innate immune system responds to the environmental factors it encounters by discriminating against foreign cells from cells of the body. Therefore, tumor cells that are proliferating at high rates, or body cells that <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> which subsequently cause physiological problems are generally not specifically targeted by the immune system, since tumor cells are the patient's own cells. Tumor cells, however are highly abnormal, and many display unusual antigens. Some such tumor antigens are inappropriate for the cell type or its environment. Monoclonal antibodies can target tumor cells or abnormal cells in the body that are recognized as body cells, but are debilitating to one's health.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Mega-City One, DeMarco awakes to {{discover}} that Dredd is missing and that the Judges are losing the war. Everywhere Assassinator droids are killing judges and seizing Justice Department buildings. Most of the surviving judges are in hiding or waging a guerrilla war against the robots, rather than risk open combat, and Narcos has appeared on television to offer rewards to civilians who inform on the whereabouts of judges, and promises to execute anyone found harbouring a judge. DeMarco teams up with Judge Roffman, who works for Judge Edgar, and Judge White, who is badly wounded. Despite DeMarco's exasperation with Roffman's cowardice and inexperience, they manage to find refuge in the secret underground base where Chief Judge Volt is attempting to organise the resistance. However the war is going badly for the judges, since Narcos appears to have an inexhaustible supply of robots {{to take the place}} of those destroyed, and the judges <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> in droves. Already Narcos's robots have seized Mega-City One's military satellites which contain the city's nuclear arsenal. Narcos also has control of the Grand Hall of Justice and the Public Surveillance Unit, enabling him to monitor the whole city and deploy his forces more effectively.|$|E
