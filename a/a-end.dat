5000|$|Now {{suppose the}} dashed {{line is a}} road with an {{extremely}} short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. In that situation, all drivers will choose the Start-A route rather than the Start-B route because Start-A will take only [...] minutes at its worst, and Start-B is guaranteed to take 45 minutes. Once at point A, every rational driver will elect to take the [...] "free" [...] road to B and from there continue to End because once again <b>A-End</b> is guaranteed to take 45 minutes while A-B-End will take at most [...] minutes. Each driver's travel time is [...] minutes, an increase from the 65 minutes required when the fast A-B road did not exist. No driver has an incentive to switch, as the two original routes (Start-A-End and Start-B-End) are both now 85 minutes. If every driver were to agree {{not to use the}} A-B path, every driver would benefit by reducing their travel time by 15 minutes. However, because any single driver will always benefit by taking the A-B path, the socially optimal distribution is not stable and so Braess's paradox occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Hymeks were notably used in {{multiple}} (up to three locomotives) as bankers on the Lickey Incline, propelling mainly freight trains from Bromsgrove to Blackwell. During trials, {{it was discovered}} that the Hymeks changed between first and second gear at about the speed required to bank a train up the incline, and so they tended to [...] "hunt" [...] between the two gears. Repeated gear changes under full power caused excessive wear and damage, plus excessive heat in the transmission fluid quickly resulted in the locomotive stopping. The simplest way to avoid excessive wear, and the stopping of a train on the incline, was to lock first gear out of action, via the master switch located in each locomotive's <b>A-end</b> cab. With all Lickey bankers allocated to Worcester shed, the main group of five locomotives (D7021 - D7025) and any replacements were all turned on the Worcester triangle, so that the A-cab was always aligned up the incline. Once {{at the bottom of the}} incline, each train which required banking would be signalled to the banking locomotives by Gloucester Panel Signal Box, so that the banking crew could then determine if it was necessary to lock out first gear on one or more of the locomotives.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} electromechanical gait training (EGT) versus treadmill training with partial body weight support (TTPBWS) on lower limb motor performance (MP) and on motor evoked potential (MEP) in patients with chronic stroke. Patients and methods Fifty patients (age 43 - 75 years) with hemiparetic stroke (7 - 72 monthsâ€² duration) were allocated randomly to two groups. Patients of group I (n = 25) received EGT and those of group II (n = 25) received TTPBWS (20 min/day, 6 days/week for 8 weeks). Main outcome measurements: Fugel-Meyer lower extremity (FMLE) MP test and MEP were assessed in all patients before rehabilitation (A-begin), {{at the end of}} rehabilitation (<b>A-end),</b> and 3 months later (A- 3 m). By transcranial magnetic stimulation, MEP threshold, MEP amplitude (MEPamp), and cortical latencies to the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius (GC) muscles were assessed. Results Better improvement in FMLE was observed in group I compared with group II. In group I, FMLE scores improved significantly at A- 3 m compared with <b>A-end.</b> A significant reduction in GC cortical latencies and increase in GC MEPamp on the second and third follow-up were observed in group I compared with group II. Although all MEP parameters of the three lower limb muscles tested improved throughout the follow-up periods on intragroup compression, they did not reach statistically significant levels. More patients in group I (unlike group II) with unobtainable MEP at A-begin had obtainable MEP at <b>A-end</b> and A- 3 m from rectus femoris and GC muscles. The change in MEPamp was the most frequent MEP variable that correlated with the change in FMLE scores (in either group). Conclusion Better improvement in MP was observed following EGT at A- 3 m. Therefore, one EGT rather than TTPBWS may be recommended to improve lower extremity MP in chronic ambulatory stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|An {{intricate}} link {{exists between}} the neuroendocrine and immune systems; however, the mechanisms responsible for this linkage are not understood. a-Endorphin (O-END) ' and the related pentapeptides methionine-enkephalin (METENK) and leucine-enkephalin (LEU-ENK) belong to the opioid family ofneurohormones, which were originally identified in brain tissues for their analgesic effects but are now recognized to have activity in the periphery, {{as well as the}} central nervous system (CNS) (1 - 3). Endogenous secretion of these neuropeptides correlates with autonomous rhythms, physical activities, and emotional states (2, 4). Circulating levels of <b>a-END</b> are increased with certain kinds of stress, and although speculative, {{it is possible that the}} stress-induced release of this or other opioids is related to the ability of stress to alter lymphocyte function (2, 4). Evidence from both in vivo pharmacological and in vitro biochemical studies suggests that opioids bind to opiate/opioid receptors and that such receptors exist in multiple forms (1, 5). Opioid binding sites have been best described for nervous tissues prepared from rodents or other animals and for cultured neuroblastoma or neuroblastoma-hybri...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Reversible {{addition}} fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) -mediated polymerization {{has emerged as}} a versatile method for preparing polymers with control over molecular weight and polydispersity. Inherent in its mechanism is the retention of the chain transfer agent, the RAFT agent, at the polymer chain ends. Typically RAFT agents are made up of two parts, the so called R (leaving) and Z (thiocarbonyl thio, stabilizing) groups. These are retained as the a-and the w-end groups of the final polymer, respectively. RAFT polymerization offers a ready method for preparing polymers with well defined end functionalities. The <b>a-end</b> functionality can easily be built into the R group. The Z group, however, is thermally unstable and can impart color and smell to the polymer. Hence, two new methods for Z end group removal were introduced. Both methods take advantage of the facile reaction between thiocarbonyl thio compounds and radicals. By matching the functionalities of the R group (<b>a-end</b> group) with that of the end modified w-chain end, both methods offer an easy route to accessing telechelic functional polymers. End functional polymers have many important uses in industry and in the biomedical field. An alcohol functional xanthate RAFT agent was synthesized and successfully used to conduct the RAFT-mediated polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP). Characterization by NMR and MALDI ToF MS confirmed that a-hydroxyl-w-xanthate-functional PVP was easily produced. In the first end group modification method radicals were generated as in atom transfer radical addition (ATRA). A hydroxyl functional a-haloester was used as the ATRA initiator with a Cu catalyst system. The alkyl radical produced by this ATRA initiator then replaced the Z group giving a telechelic hydroxyl functional polymer. NMR analysis showed that the thiocarbonyl thio end group was completely removed. The hydroxyl functionality was quantified by derivatizing with trichloro acetyl isocyanate and subsequent analysis by NMR. MALDI ToF MS analysis, however, was inconclusive. In the second method the thiocarbonyl thio end group was removed by simply heating the polymer with hydrogen peroxide, thereby replacing the Z group with a hydroxyl end group at the w-chain end, giving a telechelic functional polymer. The telechelic hydroxyl functional polymer was subsequently crosslinked with a trifunctional isocyanate to make a PVP hydrogel. This confirmed that the end-modified polymer was indeed telechelic. The swelling kinetics of this hydrogel were determined in water at 37 oC...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} {{cationic}} ring-opening polymerization of 2 -methyl- 2 -oxazoline (MOx) using bio-based initiator (GCTs). The functional initiator GCTs was prepared by tosylation of the corresponding alcohol: glycerol carbonate (GC). The termination {{stage of the}} polymerization was achieved in presence of KOH and the telechelic polyoxazoline carrying five-membered cyclic carbonate and oxazolium end groups (GC-POxium) was converted to ((HO) 2 -POx-OH) carrying a-diol and x-hydroxyl groups. End-functionalized polyoxazolines (HO) 2 -POx-OH with Mn ranging from 4200 to 8400 g mol 1 were synthesized. According to GPC results, the polymerizations of MOx using GCTs and other initiator coming from 1, 2 -isopropylidene-glycerol (Solk-Ts) were compared. On the basis of FTIR and NMR spectroscopies, the chemical modification of end chains of polyoxazolines was investigated by two alternative synthetic routes. The isocyanate route is a postpolymerization urethanization. The nucleophilic reactivity of the a-diol and x-hydroxyl groups of (HO) 2 -POx-OH was studied with functional isocyanate (TESPI). In the carbonate route, the electrophilic reactivity of a- and x-end groups of GC-POxium were explored with amine. It was demonstrated that during the termination stage of the polymerization in presence of allylamine both urethane linker in <b>a-end</b> chain was synthesized and the x-oxazolium group was converted into terminal amine. The carbonate route is an alternative to synthesize urethane without isocyanate...|$|E
40|$|Aims The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of long-term repetitive locomotor training on a treadmill with partial body weight support (TTPBWS) on motor performance of the swinging and supported paretic upper limb and to explore the neurophysiological mechanism underlying this improvement. Materials and Methods Thirty ambulatory chronic hemiparetic stroke patients were assigned randomly to either one of two experimental conditions while being trained for 20 min on a treadmill with PBWS 6 days a week for 8 weeks. Patients under condition 1 received verbal cueing to perform bilateral upper limb swinging. In condition 2, patients were instructed to support both upper limbs by holding the treadmill handrails. Fugel-Meyer upper extremity motor performance test (FMUE) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the paretic middle deltoid (D), biceps brachii (BB), and abductor pollicis brevis muscles were assessed before rehabilitation (A-begin), immediately at its end (<b>A-end),</b> and 3 months later (A- 3 m). Changes in the FMUE scores and MEP variables were used for comparisons among groups. Results Both rehabilitation conditions resulted in a greater than 10 % increase in the mean FMUE score. Group I showed a significant improvement in MEP variables (lower resting threshold, shorter central motor conduction time, and higher amplitude) in the three tested muscles. Group II showed a significant improvement in all the MEP variables of abductor pollicis brevis muscle and an increase in the MEP amplitude of only the BB muscle. Changes in the MEP threshold and amplitude of D and BB muscles were significantly higher in the patients in group I than those in group II. Conclusion Active bilateral upper limb swinging during treadmill training is more effective in improving paretic upper limb motor performance than training with supported upper limbs on treadmill handrails. Central neural plasticity may be underlying this recovery. Task-dependent neuronal coupling between lower and upper limb muscles during walking could be beneficial in stroke rehabilitation...|$|E
