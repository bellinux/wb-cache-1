40|$|This new utility patent is {{an active}} design that relies on the lung's role as an organic heat {{exchanger}} for providing deep body core heating of air. It {{is based on the}} fact that the greatest heat loss mechanism for an insulated human body immersed in a cold water environment is due to heat loss through respiration. This innovation successfully merges two existing technologies (cold immersion suit and existing valve technologies) to produce a new product that helps prevent against the onset of hypothermia at sea. During normal operations, a human maintains an approximate body temperature of [98. 6 F (37 C) ]. A mechanism was developed to recover the warm temperature from the body and reticulate it in a survival suit. The primary intention is to develop an encompassing systems design that can both easily and cost effectively be integrated in all existing currently manufactured cold water survival suits, and as such, it should be noted that the cold water immersion suit is only used as a framework or tool for laying out the required design elements. At the heart of the suit is the Warm Air Recovery (WAR) system, which relies on a single, large Main <b>Purge</b> <b>Valve</b> (MPV) and secondary <b>Purge</b> <b>Valves</b> (PV) to operate. The main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> has a thin membrane, which is normally closed, and acts as a one-way check valve. When warm air is expelled from the lungs, it causes the main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to open. <b>Air</b> forced from the MPV is dumped directly into the suit, thereby providing warmth to the torso, legs, and arms. A slight positive over-pressure in the suit causes warm waste air (or water if the suit is punctured) to be safely vented into the sea through large PVs located at the bottom of each arm and leg. The secondary <b>purge</b> <b>valves</b> act to prevent the buildup of large concentrations of CO 2 gas and help guard against asphyxia. It is noted that the MPV causes the inhalation and exhalation cycles to be completely isolated from one another in the current suit design...|$|R
40|$|DWPF Engineering {{personnel}} {{requested that}} a new minimum backup film cooler air flow rate, which will meet the off-gas safety basis limits for both normal and seismic sludge-only operations, be calculated when the <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> to the borescope cameras is isolated from the melter. Specifically, it was requested that the latest calculations which were used to set the off-gas flammability safety bases for the sludge batch 2 and 3 feeds be revised, while maintaining all other process variables affecting off-gas flammability such as total organic carbon (TOC), feed rate, melter <b>air</b> <b>purges,</b> and vapor space temperature at their current respective maximum or minimum limits. Before attempting to calculate the new minimum backup film cooler air flow, {{some of the key}} elements of the combustion model were reviewed, and it was determined that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow of 233 lb/hr is adequate to satisfy the off-gas flammability safety bases for both normal and seismic operations i n the absence of any borescope camera <b>air</b> <b>purge.</b> It is, therefore, concluded that {{there is no need to}} revise the reference E- 7 calculations. This conclusion is in essence based on the fact that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow was set to satisfy the minimum combustion air requirement under the worst-case operating scenario involving a design basis earthquake during which all the <b>air</b> <b>purges</b> not only to the borescope cameras but to the seal pot are presumed to be lost due to pipe ruptures. The minimum combustion <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> is currently set at 150 per cent of the stoichiometric air flow required to combust 3 times the normal flow of flammable gases. The DWPF control strategy has been that 100 per cent of the required minimum combustion air is to be provided by the controlled <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> through the backup film cooler alone...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>purging</b> {{is a new}} way of {{reducing}} the moisture content of coarse coal (i. e. within the 50 - 0. 5 mm size range) products from vibrating basket centrifuges. The process, which involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air through the coal bed as it traverses the centrifuge basket, has recently been shown to work at commercial scale. This paper describes some background modelling and experimental work that was undertaken to enhance understanding of the technique. The most critical variables affecting <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> are the speed of the air exiting the bed and the height of the bed itself. Both parameters were characterised at commercial scale through a combination of experimental tests and modelling. These data were then used to predict the flow rate of the air into the bed and also the pressure drop across it. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental data. Based on this information it was then possible to establish that the operating costs of <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> would be of the order of A$ 0. 02 - 0. 03 /ton of coal, considerably less than the financial gains associated with drier products. The next stage of assessing <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> would involve prolonged trials in different plant situations to resolve the remaining engineering issues. The technology is now sufficiently well understood for these trials to be approached with some confidence. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} century the petro {{chemical}} industry has provided an abundant and cheap source of hydrocarbons that have impacted and transformed many facets of our lives. Petrochemicals not only provide fuel that revolutionized transportation industry but also provided cheap petrochemical feedstock molecules that form a basis of many textiles, plastics, adhesives, detergents, and lubricants that are indispensable in modern life. Our dependence on the petrochemical industry and the sheer quantity of petrochemical based products that are consumed {{have led to a}} number of adverse and unintended effects on our environment. Recent attention to unintended effects of the petrochemical industry such as climate change, air pollution, and landfill overflow have sparked renewed interest in green chemistry and research in renewables that could potentially decrease our dependence on the petrochemical industry. Over the last two decades, with the advent of simple and cheap genetic engineering, a new field called metabolic engineering has emerged. A large focus of this field is centered around re-engineering the metabolism of simple organisms to produce bulk and specialty chemicals. We genetically engineered a lithoautotrophic organism, Ralstonia eutropha, to produce drop-in ready biofuels (isobutanol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol) in an electro-bio reactor using CO 2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input. This method integrates electrochemical formate production and biological CO 2 fixation and higher alcohol synthesis. The liquid fuels generated are a relatively stable way to store energy and possess energy densities about 100 times higher than current-day batteries. A different approach to metabolic engineering coined synthetic biochemistry seeks to reconstitute complex metabolic pathways outside of cells. The Synthetic Biochemistry approach eliminates the myriad unwanted side reactions that occur in cells and product toxicity, enabling near 100 % theoretical yields. Unfortunately, eliminating the cellular environment also eliminates key regulatory networks involved in maintaining appropriate carbon flux and cofactor balance. Synthetic biochemistry seeks to replace these complex regulatory networks in vitro by creating self-balancing pathways that automatically regulate the production and consumption of cofactors while maintaining constant carbon flux through the pathway. To this end, we developed the concept of a molecular <b>purge</b> <b>valve.</b> Generally, the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is made up of a NADPH dependent oxidase, a NADH dependent oxidase and a NADH specific oxidase (noxE). We first demonstrated this proof of concept by engineering the G. stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to flip its cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH and using it in the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to transform pyruvate to either polyhydroxybutyrate bioplastic or isoprene at near quantitative yields. The concept of using a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to maintain carbon flux in an inherently imbalanced pathway was expanded through the production of polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose using a synthetic pathway called the PBG cycle. The PBG cycle is made up of enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway, the bifido shunt, and standard glycolysis (EMP). This pathway utilizes the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> concept at the two reductase enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and produced the bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose. The PBG pathway ran semi-continuously for 55 hours and produced 86 % yield from 110 mM glucose. The pathway had a maximum productivity of 0. 7 g/L PHB and maintained 50 % of its productivity {{over the course of the}} 55 hours at room temperature. The PBG cycle serves as a demonstration that synthetic biochemistry could be an alternative to in vivo metabolic engineering for the production of bulk and specialty chemicals and could potentially be one way to replace some of the petrochemicals we use today with renewable bio-based chemicals...|$|R
50|$|Many hookahs are {{equipped}} with a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the airspace in the water jar to purge stale smoke that has been sitting unused in the jar for too long. This one-way valve is typically a simple ball bearing sitting over a port that seals the port by gravity alone and will open if positive pressure is created by blowing into the hose. The bearing is held captive with a screw-on cover. The cover should be opened and the bearing and seat cleaned of residue and corrosion regularly to ensure proper sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Deposits {{reduce the}} heat {{transfer}} in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-volatile salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is evaporated must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive [...] "blow-down" [...] (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form scale. Therefore, the make-up water added to replace any losses of feedwater must be demineralized/deionized water, unless a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is used to remove dissolved minerals.|$|R

It will not function on a multiple-hose hookah unless all other hoses are plugged. Sometimes one-way valves are put in the hose sockets to avoid the need to manually plug hoses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the development of protecting system for window. In detail, we tried to develop pollution preventing system of a glass, mirror, or camera lens. For this, the new method for efficient pollution prevention was designed and the characteristic evaluation for developing the system is partly performed. Formerly, the method using <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> is generally used for preventing the pollution of camera window. However, the conventional method often induces contaminations due to back flow of <b>air</b> <b>purging.</b> These pollutants can be crucial damage to the camera window and peripheral materials especially in clean room condition. And the conventional method always requires air supply, therefore it is difficult to apply the method where air source can not be supplied such as traveling crane located at mountain altitudes. To solve above mentioned the problem, the efficient concept for preventing pollution of camera window is proposed in this research. Without <b>air</b> <b>purging,</b> we proposed the new method using repulsion induced by electrifying dirty or moisture to positive magnetic force with high-voltage charge and then injecting gas to the ITO(Indium Tin Oxide) coating window for generating positive ion. To sum up, in this research, we aim to develop an efficient pollution preventing system for camera window based on the new method through characteristic evaluation and stabilization of the designed system...|$|R

40|$|This Engineering Note {{studies the}} design of the Dry <b>Air</b> <b>Purge</b> that is going to flow through the Warm Tube of the End Calorimeter of the D-O Calorimeter. The Tev tubes through the E.

The Dry <b>Air</b> <b>Purge</b> will involve flowing Dry Air through the annular region between the Warm Tube and the Tev Beam Pipe. This air flow is intended to prevent condensation from forming in this region which could turn to ice under cryogenic temperatures.

40|$|CSIRO/Novatech Consulting {{have been}} {{developing}} <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> {{as a new}} way of reducing the moisture content of coarse coal products from vibrating basket centrifuges. The process involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air, via an air knife manifold, through the coal bed as it traverses the centrifuge basket. This paper describes the results obtained when the process was trialled in a commercial scale centrifuge, following successful previous bench and pilot scale work reported previously. Five manifolds of different shapes and sizes were tested. The best results were achieved with units of square cross-section, located close to the outlet edge of the basket. Depending on air speed, product moisture was reduced by between 0. 7 and 0. 9 wt% at a confidence level exceeding 95 %. The best results approached closely the 1. 0 wt% moisture reduction target which had been adopted as the project objective. <b>Air</b> <b>purging</b> had no significant effect on the content or size distribution of the solids in the centrate. Increasing air speed led to larger moisture reductions. Higher air speeds were needed compared with previous pilot scale work probably due to the thicker beds encountered in the full scale centrifuge. Despite the higher air speed, the actual air usage (cfm/t of coal) was much more efficient at full scale, being less than half that at pilot scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
