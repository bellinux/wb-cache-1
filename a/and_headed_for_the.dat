5|$|In 1928, Smith was {{selected}} as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930 {{from a list of}} over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his all-weather experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three-engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett (named in Bennett's honor) <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> South Pole on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at the South Pole with Admiral Richard Byrd.|$|E
5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover {{the withdrawal of the}} damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E

This occupied them until March when a revolt broke out in Egypt, and {{the regiment}} drew its equipment back out of storage <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting. Once the rioting had been quelled, the regiment once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when {{the majority of the}} brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment ceased to be a unit.|$|E

5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} her {{movements}} and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused to pay for it, believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce, 276 U.S. 469 (1928). The court found that under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or}} not the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E
