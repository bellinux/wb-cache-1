30|$|This {{frequency}} selectivity of {{the resource}} allocation originates from {{the nature of the}} DSL channel. By removing the 30 % most dominant crosstalk, 80 to 90 % of the transmit rate improvement of full crosstalk cancellation can be achieved[13]. Further increasing the crosstalk canceller tap budget will have little improvement on the transmit rates. Therefore the tones with dominant crosstalk are always <b>allocated</b> <b>with</b> crosstalk canceller taps. Removing the crosstalk on some of the remaining tones does not contribute much to the transmit rate, and hence these tones are always <b>allocated</b> <b>with</b> few crosstalk canceller taps.|$|R
