40|$|The surface {{oxidation}} of a smooth gold electrode in perchloric acid was studied by constant potential anodization and constant current cathodization under various conditions. The anodic reaction is explained as a mixed process of oxygen evolution a d {{the formation of}} chemisorbed oxygen atoms which are presumed to take the configuration of <b>auric</b> <b>oxide</b> when more than one layer thick. The grain boundary diffusion of oxygen atoms {{may account for the}} residual current and the increase in the extent of oxidation at constant poten-tial. Electron micrographs and double layer capacities are consistent with the other findings. The {{surface oxidation}} of gold has been studied in paral le l with that of p la t inum by means of chro-nopotent iometry (1 - 6), vo l tammetry (7), t r iangu-lar voltage sweep (8), and chemical reaction (1, 9). As with the case of p lat inum, data and in terpreta...|$|E
40|$|Gold/iron oxide nanocomposites {{offer the}} promise of {{combining}} the unique traits of both gold and iron oxide nanomaterials to enable new applications. In this work, a simple and safe method has been established whereby the morphology of gold material in gold/iron oxide nanocomposites can be controlled to be nanowire or nanosphere by adjusting the initial molar ratio of citrate-coated iron <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles to <b>auric</b> acid. Gold/iron <b>oxide</b> nanowires and nanospheres were synthesized through this method. Their structural, optical, and magnetic properties were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). These materials substantially maintained the optical properties of gold nanomaterials and magnetic features of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles.
