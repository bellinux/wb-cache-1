The question of dispersion of pharmaceutical products in the environment is well known by researchers from almost 20 years. Many European projects concerned this new kind of pollution and many works have been published, but a whole world vision is still missing. A unique definition accepted by all researchers, which can describe "the voluntary or <b>accidental</b> <b>dispersion</b> of pharmaceutical products in the environment", is still not found. Reading the title of the Meeting anyone connect "Multivariate Analysis" with their father R. A. Fisher or "Chemometrics" with B. Kowalski. With this work we would like to define some terms as "Ecopharmacology", "Biopharmacology", "Pharmacovigilance" and "Biorape"...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Institute of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (France) is {{planning}} the set-up of an automatic nuclear aerosol monitoring network over the French territory. Each of the stations {{will be able}} to automatically sample the air aerosol content and provide activity concentration measurements on several radionuclides. This should help monitor the French and neighbouring countries nuclear power plants set. It would help evaluate the impact of a radiological incident occurring at one of these nuclear facilities. This paper is devoted to the spatial design of such a network. Here, any potential network is judged on its ability to extrapolate activity concentrations measured on the network stations over the whole domain. The performance of a network is quantitatively assessed through a cost function that measures the discrepancy between the extrapolation and the true concentration fields. These true fields are obtained through the computation of a database of dispersion accidents over one year of meteorology and originating from 20 French nuclear sites. A close to optimal network is then looked for using a simulated annealing optimisation. The results emphasise the importance of the cost function in the design of a network aimed at monitoring an <b>accidental</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Several choices of norm used in the cost function are studied and give way to different designs. The influence of the number of stations is discussed. A comparison with a purely geometric approach which does not involve simulations with a chemistry-transport model is performed...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{proteins}} (PrP) are {{the main}} responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). The TSE etiological agent is a misfolded form of the normal cellular prion protein. The amyloidal aggregates accumulated in the brain of infected animals and mainly composed of PrPSc exhibit resistance to protease attack and many conventional inactivating procedures. The prion protein diseases cause an environmental issue because the environment {{and in particular the}} soil compartment can be contaminated and then become a potential reservoir and diffuser of TSEs infectivity as a consequence of (i) <b>accidental</b> <b>dispersion</b> from storage plants of meat and bone meal, (ii) incorporation of contaminated material in fertilizers, (iii) possible natural contamination of pasture soils by grazing herds, and (v) burial of carcasses. The environmental problem can be even more relevant because very low amounts of PrPSc are able to propagate the disease. Several studies evidenced that infectious prion protein remains active in soils for years. Contaminated soils result, thus, a possible critical route of TSE transmission in wild animals. Soil can also protect prion protein toward degradation processes due to the presence of humic substances and inorganic components such as clays. Mineral and organic colloids and the more common association between clay minerals and humic substances can contribute to the adsorption/entrapment of molecules and macromolecules. The polymerization of organic monomeric humic precursors occurring in soil in the presence of oxidative enzymes or manganese and iron oxides, {{is considered one of the}} most important processes contributing to the formation of humic substances. The process is very fast and produces a population of polymeric products of different molecular structures, sizes, shapes and complexity. Other molecules and possibly biomacromolecules such as proteins may be involved. The aim of the present work was to study by CPMAS 13 C-NMR the interactions between a non pathogenic ovine recombinant prion protein and a model soil system represented by a manganese oxide in the form of birnessite (-MnO 2), coated with a polymerized catechol. To better understand the effect of the polymerization process, PrP was added to the birnessite-cathecol system either before or after the polymerization processes. The NMR spectra of the prion protein interacting directly with birnessite revealed disappearance of the signals due to the paramagnetic nature of manganese oxide or abiotic degradation. Conversely, the signal pattern of the protein re-appeared as it is mixed to the soil-like system either during or after the catechol polymerization process. Results suggested that the possible interactions of the prion protein on soil systems can be mediated by natural organic matter. However, deeper studies on more complex real soil systems are needed to definitely confirm such hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|<b>Accidental</b> {{release and}} <b>dispersion</b> of toxic gases were always major hazards {{for public health}} and safety that process {{industries}} had to deal with. Real terrain dispersion simulation for risk analysis purposes poses specific difficulties related to complex turbulence phenomena development. especially when obstructions are found into the flow region. In this paper, several turbulence models are tested and compared against experimental data of dense vapor dispersion, in order to decide for their suitability for simulating such flows. Computations were carried out using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code CFX 5. 6, while experimental data were obtained from Thorney Island large scale field trials. Computational results showed good agreement with experimental measurements indicating that CFDs provide a reliable means of estimating gas dispersion in real terrains. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{concentration}} fluctuation is {{an indispensable}} element in studies on risk assessment of toxic gas dispersion in urban areas. Wind velocity fluctuation occurs through the nonlinear feature of flow, {{as well as}} concentration fluctuations. In the case of urban areas with a variable scale of eddies and {{a wide range of}} turbulence length scales, wind randomly flows in and out of open metropolitan spaces. Thus, fluctuation features are influenced by urban geometry, such as the density or height of buildings. Because of these fluctuations, some peak concentrations have much higher values than the average concentration. This means that pedestrians could be exposed to a potentially fatal dose within a split second. Therefore, simply building up a database of average concentrations is inadequate for the assessment of <b>accidental</b> pollutant <b>dispersion.</b> It is necessary to analyze the characteristics of fluctuations in urban areas, and this is the objective of our report. In order to measure the fluctuation data, a wind tunnel experiment was conducted using a finely recreated model of an actual residential area in Japan. In the model, six source points of toxic gas were located in characteristic places, such as the spaces between high-rise buildings or from a highway. Four measurement points were positioned between high-rise buildings, corresponding to the location of the inlet ducts of the building. In this research, the vacant space between the buildings is described as a ‘void’. Such voids comprise the main component of ventilation in urba...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 66 - 67). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Aerosol is a suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas. Determining the behaviour of aerosols is a complex and important problem. In this research I have done scientific computations for validating the FLACS code for describing aerosol phenomena. I have developed Fortran codes for droplet motion, evaporation, variation of Weber number of droplets, and droplet break up time, and compared these results with the results obtained from the FLACS simulation. The behaviour of decane droplet cloud of different diameters was simulated over realistic range conditions of temperature and concentration. I studied the droplets' motion; their interaction with the surrounding fluid, deformation, evaporation, secondary break up under various wind conditions and coalescence separately, so that each phenomenon could be understood fully without confounding mutual influence. Finally I compared these simulation results with theory and the available experimental data. The study focuses on the two-phase aspects, with emphasis on flash atomisation and droplet dynamics downstream. This research has also ascertained whether two phase modelling practice and philosophy adopted for the problem of <b>accidental</b> atmospheric <b>dispersion</b> releases of 'flashing' substances as utilized in the FLACS code is consistent and up to date with literature in the public domain. It has identified strengths and weaknesses of the current models and possible alternative modelling approaches. Finally, it provides clear recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We are {{designing}} an all-scintillator Compton gamma imager {{for use in}} pre-event {{criminal and}} national security investigations involving radioactive threat material. The instrument will also be useful post-event, in the consequence management of an <b>accidental</b> or malicious <b>dispersion</b> of radioactivity. It has applications as well in decommissioning of contaminated facilities. To satisfy requirements for a rugged and portable instrument, we have chosen solid scintillator for the active volumes of both the scatter and absorber detectors. Using the BEAMnrc/EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulation package, we have constructed models using four different materials for the scatter detector: LaBr 3, NaI, CaF 2 and PVT. We have developed a measure to quantify detector performance and have used this to compare {{the performance of the}} different models. Using a fitting algorithm, we have reconstructed images from the simulated data. We find that LaBr 3 provides the best performance. CaF 2 and NaI provide similar performance, slightly worse than LaBr 3. All of the materials investigated for the scatter detector, including PVT, have the potential to provide performance adequate for our purposes. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{applied the}} American Meteorological Society and Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) {{to assess the}} risk caused by an <b>accidental</b> release and <b>dispersion</b> of the toxic {{chemical}} benzene {{in the vicinity of}} a highly populated urban area. The modeling domain encompasses the Korean megacity of Ulsan, which includes two national industrial complexes and is characterized by a complex coastal terrain. Multiple AERMOD simulations were conducted for an assumed emission scenario using background wind data from August between 2009 and 2013. The series of experiments produced the spatial accident probability patterns for different concentration levels during daytime and nighttime scenarios based on the corresponding dominant wind patterns. This study further quantifies the potential accident risk {{based on the number of}} affected individuals by combining the accident probability with the indoor and outdoor population estimates. The chemical gas dispersion characteristics depend on various local meteorological conditions, such as the land-sea breeze direction, which alternates between daytime and nighttime, and the atmospheric stability. The results reveal that benzene dispersion affects a much larger area during the nighttime owing to the presence of a nocturnal stable boundary layer with significant temperature stratification. The affected area is smaller during the daytime owing to decreased stability and enhanced vertical mixing in the boundary layer. The results include a high degree of uncertainty during the nighttime owing to weak wind speeds and the lack of a prevailing wind direction, which impact the vulnerable area. However, vulnerable areas are more effectively identified during the daytime, when more consistent meteorological conditions exist. However, the potential risk becomes much lower during the nighttime owing to a substantial reduction of the outdoor population...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} concern about <b>accidental</b> {{releases}} and <b>dispersion</b> of toxic and flammable industrial chemicals into the atmosphere. Their toxic effects and/or flammable properties, combined with their widespread use and transport through urban areas, make most industrial chemicals very dangerous. Many industrial chemicals are transported and stored as pressurized liquefied gases in large quantities. The chemical, petrochemical and petroleum industries, {{as well as}} regulatory agencies, need realistic dispersion simulations for risk analysis purposes. If accidentally released into the atmosphere, a pressurized liquefied gas suffers a rapid de-pressurisation {{and as a consequence}} boils violently. This process {{is referred to as the}} flashing process. Complete flashing results in the formation of a two-phase jet with high momentum. Some of the droplets may deposit on the ground and form a pool which gradually evaporates. This thesis presents the development of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology for studies of pressurized liquefied gas releases into the atmosphere. The methodology is implemented in the CFD model FLACS. The performances of existing source term models in predicting recent experimental observations are assessed. It is found that the energy balance model gives the best predictions for the mass flow rate at the exit orifice. Uncertainties are present in the quality of the predictions for the size distribution of droplets and it is recommended to perform sensitivity studies. Investigation of the dispersion of heavy particles in isotropic turbulent flows by means of the Kinematic Simulation approach allows emphasizing the importance of the inertia and crossing trajectory effects. An Euler-Euler approach based on the assumption of homogeneous flow, namely the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM), and an Euler-Lagrange approach are implemented in the FLACS CFD model in order to simulate two-phase flows. The two-phase flow models are validated against laboratory scale experiments. Improvements of the current FLACS models for liquid spreading and evaporation on the ground are developed and an algorithm is implemented in order to solve the equations of the pool model on a user-defined uniform grid. Obstructed and non-obstructed large-scale experiments are simulated with the new methodology. The validation of the methodology with both the HEM and the Euler- Lagrange approaches is shown to be relatively successful. Its simplicity of use makes the HEM approach very attractive for industrial applications. The Euler-Lagrange approach has a wider range of physical applications and provides more options to characterize the dispersed phase and its interaction with the continuous phase. This approach should be used when the HEM approach reaches its limitations. </p...|$|R
