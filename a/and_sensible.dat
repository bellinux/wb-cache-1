5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful <b>and</b> <b>sensible,</b> even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with other}} Greek intellectuals, Posidonius favored Rome as the {{stabilizing}} {{power in a}} turbulent world.

25|$|The band briefly {{broke up}} after Music for Pleasure (1977), the {{follow-up}} to their debut album, was critically dismissed. They quickly reformed without Brian James, and released Machine Gun Etiquette (1979). In the 1980s they released four studio albums, The Black Album (1980), Strawberries (1982), Phantasmagoria (1985), and Anything (1986). The latter two albums did not feature Captain Sensible, {{who had left}} the band in 1984. In 1988, James <b>and</b> <b>Sensible</b> rejoined to play what {{was said to be}} the Damned's final live show. This was released the next year as the live album Final Damnation.|$|E
25|$|In an 1847 lecture {{entitled}} On Matter, Living Force, and Heat, James Prescott Joule {{characterized the}} terms latent heat <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively. He described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. {{a form of}} potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles or what {{was known as a}} living force. At the time of Joule kinetic energy either held 'invisibly' internally or held 'visibly' externally was known as a living force.|$|E
25|$|Mediation is {{a process}} during which abductors and the left behind family, {{assisted}} by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars brought great {{changes to}} the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making {{attendant}} to the Emperor Napoleon I of France was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Guérin. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, Orientalism, Egyptian motifs, the tragic anti-hero, the wild landscape, the historical novel, and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance—all these elements of Romanticism—created a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, Théodore Géricault opened the path to romanticism with his monumental Raft of the Medusa exposed at the 1819 Salon. Camille Corot tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> to atmospheric variations at the same time.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{discipline}} of anthropology, the term culture represents the customs, values, morals, laws and rituals which a particular group or society shares. In the public imagination, Wall Street represents economics and finance. However, although Wall Street employees may exhibit greedy and self-interested behaviours to the public, these behaviours are justified through their own value system and social practices. Various anthropologists have conducted research on Wall Street and it is their research which can confirm the negative views of Wall Street while providing the public with information that can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of how Wall Street workers perceive themselves. Anthropologist Karen Ho, who has conducted ethnographic research on Wall Street, states in Situating Global Capitalisms that the markets are beginning to self-regulate themselves in terms of neoliberalism. Through the perception of the public, financial investors take on a role that has already been established for them. It is both appropriate and fitting to call Wall Street a culture because of the system of values and practices it holds onto. Moreover, anthropological insight can help improve the general public's understanding of Wall Street and in turn allow the public to appreciate the culture of Wall Street which is both logical <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> to the workers themselves.|$|E

The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal {{is an example of}} a famous nick between Bold Ruler's sire Nasrullah and daughters of Princequillo. The goal was to balance the speed, precocity, and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo's stamina, soundness, <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> temperament.|$|E

30|$|Santos {{tends to}} have a high {{proportion}} of impervious cover (all urban areas except some hills), which is a key determinant of energy flux portioning. Basically, during the day the sea surface warms less rapidly than terrestrial surfaces <b>and</b> this suppresses <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> latent heat fluxes. During the evening and night the sea surface cools less rapidly than terrestrial surfaces and this enhances the <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> latent heat loss (Miller et al. 2003).|$|R

500|$|The special {{was written}} {{with the goal}} of [...] "telling the story in the most honest and sincere way." [...] The writers {{attempted}} to continue the tense and unpleasant relationship between Frankie and Mr. Herriman, which they had begun developing since the series began, but approaching it in a believable <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> fashion. With the heavy plot running through the special, the writers tried to use Bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it. They wrote Bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously, but did not want him to be cruel or malicious.|$|E
500|$|Scott further commended {{the acting}} by Hadas Yaron, saying, [...] "Shira is modest <b>and</b> <b>sensible,</b> forthright with her {{opinions}} and discreet about expressing emotion, {{but the way}} Ms. Yaron composes her features—and {{the way she is}} lighted by Ms. Burshtein and the cinematographer, Asaf Sudry—seems to offer direct access to her soul." [...] Likewise, Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan found Yaron's performance [...] "exceptional". By contrast, Peter Cavanese from Pleasanton Weekly disliked the idea of Shira marrying under the circumstances in the film and wrote that she [...] "comes across as temperamentally battered by her mother and her potential husband, who is himself slow to see the wisdom of marrying Shira".|$|E

While Harrison biographer Dale Allison interprets a degree of animosity towards the other Beatles in the song's lyrics, Leng argues that they are directed solely at the legal profession. Inglis similarly dismisses the idea that Harrison was targeting his former bandmates; instead, the song expresses [...] "frustration rather than hostility" [...] and addresses the [...] "absurdity" [...] of the situation. Inglis writes of [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues": [...] "It makes clear that amid the legal arguments, financial requirements, and technical language... there are four former friends who are powerless to control events." ...|$|E

Jon Wise from The People said that after Abi received a makeover in 2010, she [...] "actually turned out to be quite pretty". In 2012, Fitzgerald told Inside Soap Laura-Jane Tyler that Abi has grown up in her first six years on screen, and is now sensible, [...] "like a [...] " [...] and has had to mature quickly because of the dramatic situations she has been involved in.

500|$|The mildly complex {{reciprocal}} skill {{system was}} generally praised, {{with a few}} exceptions. IGN, though finding the manual's {{description of the system}} unclear, found the classes well balanced and well designed for all play styles. GameSpot found the system clear <b>and</b> <b>sensible.</b> PC Gamer, by contrast, found the system unbalanced, with combat privileged over other features. Computer Gaming World felt the system's privileging of combinations of single-handed combat weapons and shields over double-handed weapons unnecessarily exploitable, but appreciated the freedom offered by the broad skillset and action-dependent leveling. GameSpy gave strong commendation to the system, stating that [...] "The advancement system makes so much sense that it makes other games, even games set in the D world such as Baldur's Gate, look silly by comparison". Morrowinds combat system was poorly received by the gaming press. GameSpot characterized it as one of the game's major weak points and GameSpy devoted the majority of their review's minor complaints to it. The system was disparaged for its simplicity and for its tendency to bore.|$|E
500|$|The second sequel, Species III {{followed}} in 2004. It premiered on Sci-Fi Channel on November 27, 2004 with a DVD release on December 7. The film's plot starts where Species II ends, revolving around Sunny Mabrey's character Sara, {{the daughter of}} Eve, reared by a doctor played by Robert Knepper. Sara, an alien-human hybrid, seeks other hybrids to mate with. Henstridge cameos {{at the beginning of}} the film. Two out of six critics mentioned on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating, with DVD Talk's reviewer noting that it is [...] "a more cohesive <b>and</b> <b>sensible</b> flick than [...] is, but ultimately, it's just a lot of the same old schtick", while Film Freak Central called it [...] "amateurish" [...] and [...] "vapid". A fourth film, Species: The Awakening was filmed in 2007, following the schedule of Species III of Sci-Fi Channel premiere and subsequent DVD release. None of the actors from the original film returned in this sequel, which instead starred Helena Mattsson as the alien-hybrid seductress.|$|E
