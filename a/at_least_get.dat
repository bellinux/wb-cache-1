5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>get</b> screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E

25|$|Operation Barbarossa {{was planned}} as a blitzkrieg {{intended}} {{to last a}} few weeks. By the autumn of 1941 {{it was clear that}} this the operation would not accomplish its goals, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly Murmansk. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times. Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps {{in the hope that the}} Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>get</b> them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.|$|E

25|$|With the semi {{final week}} {{just around the}} corner, Week 13 saw some close matches {{including}} the opener between the Highlanders and the Hurricanes at the cake tin. The score was 22 – 16 to the Hurricanes at 80 minutes but a final minute try to Toby Morland in the corner turned things around. Nick Evans {{needed to get the}} kick over to win the game but was unsuccessful allowing the Hurricanes to win the game lucky to not have the same situation when the Hurricanes lost to the Force in week 6. The force continued their up and down season by comfortably beating the cheetahs. The Waratahs narrowly lost going down to the chiefs. The Brumbies pulled an upset win over the Crusaders to keep their semi final hopes alive. The Sharks dominated the lions to make sure they would <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>get</b> a home semi final. The Blues lost their third game in a row going down to the Bulls which slimmed the chances of the Blues securing a semi final spot and helped the Bulls secure a semi final spot. The last game of the week saw the stormers easily put away the Reds.|$|E

[...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E

Super Show! for another season following extensive network rebranding by Hasbro and Discovery, effectively canceling the series. Jacobs admitted he was surprised by this turn of events, noting [...] "Everything we heard was that the show {{has been a real}} Cinderella story for the Hub and that it was rating really well with viewers.

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are certainly going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we learned anything from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>get</b> some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner?

[...] After Lennon played some of his recent songs and rock 'n' roll classics, Ono sang a two-song set consisting of [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" [...] followed by [...] "John John (Let's Hope for Peace)."
