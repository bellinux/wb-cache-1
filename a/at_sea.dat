5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the {{embalming}} supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers {{because of the need}} to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, the majority of the burials <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> However complaints about the burials <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> were made by families and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer embalming supplies, and were able to limit burials <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, {{changes in}} the {{training}} of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> declined to {{less than a year}} as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.|$|E
