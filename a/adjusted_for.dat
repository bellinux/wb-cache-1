5|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} marihuana illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an excise tax on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation) for industrial users. Detailed sales logs {{were required to}} record marihuana sales. Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} using data from several programs, each implemented at a dif-ferent location, to compare what their e¤ect would be if they were implemented at a speci 8 ̆ 5 c location. In particular, we study the e¤ectiveness of nonexperimental strategies in adjust-ing for di¤erences across comparison groups arising from two sources. First, we <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> di¤erences {{in the distribution of}} individual characteristics simultaneously across all locations by using unconfoundedness-based and conditional di¤erence-in-di¤erence methods for multiple treatments. Second, we explicitly <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> di¤erences in local economic conditions. We stress the importance of analyzing the overlap of, and <b>adjusting</b> <b>for,</b> local economic conditions after program participation. Our results suggest that the strategies studied are valuable econometric tools for the problem we consider, as long as we <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> a rich set of individual characteristics and have su ¢ cient overlap across locations for both individual and local labor market charac-teristics. Our results show that the overlap analysis of these two sets of variables is critical for identifying non-comparable groups and they illustrate the di ¢ culty of <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> loca...|$|R

As a baseline, we find that period-end prices reflect unbiased forecasts in markets with private information and inexperienced traders.

With high bias forecasts, traders need experience and public forecast releases before price <b>adjusts</b> <b>for</b> the bias.

For example, one study drawing on Finnish census data concluded that increases in offspring mortality with paternal age could be explained completely by parental loss. On the other hand, a population-based cohort study drawing on 2.6 million records from Sweden found that risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was only positively associated with paternal age when comparing siblings.|$|R

40|$|Adult Americans are {{encouraged}} to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each week. National surveys that collect physical activity data to assess whether or not adults adhere to this guideline use self-report questionnaires that are prone to measurement error and nonresponse. Studies have examined the individual effects {{of each of these}} error sources on estimators of physical activity, but {{little is known about the}} consequences of not <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> both error sources. We conducted a simulation study to determine how estimators of adherence to the guideline for adults to engage in 150 minutes of MVPA each week respond to different magnitudes of measurement and nonresponse errors in self-reported physical activity survey data. Estimators that <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> both measurement and nonresponse errors provide the least amount of bias regardless of the magnitudes of measurement error and nonresponse. In some scenarios, the naïve estimator, which does not <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> either error source, results in less bias than estimators that <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> only one error source.
