5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. <b>At</b> <b>speeds</b> below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. <b>At</b> <b>speeds</b> above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E

5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> near that of light.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan {{to form a}} {{new study}} group, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC), with the {{explicit}} goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, {{the decision was made to}} fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115. This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> as low as 69mph, about ⅓ that of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 70 knots.|$|E
50|$|During {{the times}} of CD writer drives, they are often marked with three {{different}} speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> of 40× (6,000 KB/s), writing to CD-RW media <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> of 16× (2,400 KB/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> of 48× (7,200 KB/s).|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{proved to}} be powerful and capable, with reserves of power <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> and reasonable fuel economy. The turbine drive was easy on the track and allowed more power at the rail.

5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and the late afternoon, with the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest. These extremely agile and wary animals can run <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Bonnie {{were in a}} {{tropical}} wave {{that emerged from the}} coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon the development of a low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415miles (670km) east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 23mph (37km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> up to , an integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E

5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|George Ivatt's 1945 {{report also}} {{recommended}} {{the removal of}} all streamlining casings and they {{were removed from the}} fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> below , and was unpopular with running shed employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away {{at the rear of the}} tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke deflectors. No. 6243 City of Lancaster was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, when it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.|$|E
