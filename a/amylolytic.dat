Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC.

Cassava {{is the main}} staple that is used in cooking, and is used to make cassava bread, a marinating sauce called cassareep, farine (similar to cous-cous), and an alcoholic drink called parakari. The production of parakari involves a complicated process with thirty different stages, {{and the use of}} a sophisticated fermentation technology. The fermentation of parakari involves the use of an <b>amylolytic</b> mold (Rhizopus), and it is the only known fermented drink to be produced by the indigenous peoples of the Americas that involves the use of an <b>amylolytic</b> process.|$|E

50|$|A. oryzae is an aerobic fungus and is {{the most}} active fermenting agents in koji as it {{produces}} <b>amylolytic,</b> and proteolytic enzymes which are essential to creating the final miso product. Amyloytic enzymes such as amylase aid in the breakdown of starch in the grains to sugar and dextrin, while proteolytic enzymes such as protease catalyze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. These both aid in the enzymatic digestion {{of the mixture of}} rice and soybeans. Depending on the strain of A. oryzae, enzymatic composition varies thereby changing the characteristics of the final miso product. For example, the strain used to create the sweeter white miso would likely produce a higher content of <b>amylolytic</b> enzymes, while comparatively a soybean miso might have a higher content of proteolytic enzyme.|$|E

50|$|The enzymes {{used in the}} {{liquefaction}} step {{are usually}} alpha-amylases derived from bacterial or fungal bioreactors (Bacillus species or Aspergillus species are {{the most commonly used}} microbe engines in the bioreactors). These convert starch into dextrins of various molecular sizes and the modified starch end product is usually given an appropriate DE (Dextrose Equivalent) rating to signify the degree of starch conversion and the amount of reducing sugars produced in the process. The enzymes used in the saccharification step are the <b>amylolytic</b> enzyme, beta-amylase (usually derived from Bacillus species) and the debranching enzyme, pullulanase (derived from Aerobacter species). These convert the dextrinised starch into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and lower molecular weight dextrins.|$|E
50|$|Madurella mycetomatis {{has been}} {{identified}} in both soil and anthill samples, growing optimally at 37 ˚C, however can viably grow at up to 40 ˚C.

Madurella mycetomatis is <b>amylolytic</b> yet is only weakly proteolytic, and has the ability to assimilate glucose, galactose, lactose and maltose, while unable to assimilate sucrose. Potassium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, asparagine and urea can also be used by the fungus. Madurella mycetomatis produces 1,8-dihydroxynapthalene a precursor to melanin - a protein extracellularly attached to proteins. Both molecules are responsible for the characteristic dark grain color. The melanin produced by the fungus has also been identified as a defense mechanism against processes such as hydrolytic enzymes, free radicals, redox buffering, antibodies and complement.

50|$|Microbes in the reticulorumen include bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and viruses. Bacteria, {{along with}} protozoa, are the {{predominant}} microbes and by mass account for 40-60% of total microbial {{matter in the}} rumen. They are categorized into several functional groups, such as fibrolytic, <b>amylolytic,</b> and proteolytic types, which preferentially digest structural carbohydrates, non-structural carbohydrates, and protein, respectively. Protozoa (40-60% of microbial mass) derive their nutrients through phagocytosis of other microbes, and degrade and digest feed carbohydrates, especially starch and sugars, and protein. Although protozoa are not essential for rumen functioning, their presence has pronounced effects. Ruminal fungi make up only 5-10% of microbes and are absent on diets poor in fibre. Despite their low numbers, the fungi still occupy an important niche in the rumen because they hydrolyse some ester linkages between lignin and hemicellulose or cellulose, and help break down digesta particles. Rumen Archaea, approximately 3% of total microbes, are mostly autotrophic methanogens and produce methane through anaerobic respiration. Most of the hydrogen produced by bacteria, protozoa and fungi is used by these methanogens to reduce carbon dioxide to methane. The maintenance of low partial pressure of hydrogen by methanogens is essential for proper functioning of the rumen. Viruses are present in unknown numbers and do not contribute to any fermentation or respiration activity. However, they do lyse microbes, releasing their contents for other microbes to assimilate and ferment in a process called microbial recycling, although recycling through the predatory activities of protozoa is quantitatively more important.|$|E

Comparisons of gene abundance in the fungi suggested that the repertoire of <b>amylolytic</b> genes adapted to their respective lifestyles. <b>Amylolytic</b> enzymes in family GH 13 were divided into four distinct clades identified as heterologous a- amylases, eukaryotic a-amylases, bacterial and fungal a-amylases and GH 13 a-glucosidases.

Patients and methods : 145 children at the age of 3 – 7 years with chronic inflammatory diseases of a stomach and duodenum are surveyed. The <b>amylolytic</b> activity of the mixed saliva by Smith-Roy-Ugolev <b>amylolytic</b> method was determined at patients. 2 clinical groups with account of median (the 50 th percentile) distribution of <b>amylolytic</b> activity of saliva are created: the first — with indicators below the median (n = 72), the second — with indicators above or equal to the median (n = 73). The endoscopic research (all children), histological research bioptates (n = 63), morphometric analysis of a duodenum mucous membrane (n = 26) were applied for the purpose of assessment of a morphofunctional condition of a stomach and duodenum. Results : It is established that predominant duodenum involvement, high frequency of isolated duodenitis, subatrophic and dystrophic changes of a duodenal mucous membrane, bigger intensity and depth of inflammatory process against lower level of nonspecific tissue protection, existence of signs of an allergic inflammation are characteristic for patients with low <b>amylolytic</b> activity of saliva.

Exoamylase fraction, A 1, has an RF of 0. 23 on the polyacrylamide gel. Viscometric analysis showed that A 1 has a slope of 0. 013, which is same as that of A 3, the extrachloroplastic amylase. A 1, however, can be distinguished from A 3 by having much higher <b>amylolytic</b> activity in succinate buffer than acetate buffer, and having much less reactivity with amylose.
