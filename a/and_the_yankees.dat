5|$|The Yankees {{felt that}} Vick had not {{lived up to}} his {{potential}} during his four seasons with the team. Considering the team now had a solid outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and Bodie, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> needed pitching; Vick became expendable. On December15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, Muddy Ruel, Del Pratt and Hank Thormahlen to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Wally Schang and Mike McNally.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.|$|E

5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin {{an investigation into the}} gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor George Raft. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after Ruth's sale, {{he went on to}} have a record setting season—statistically, one of the {{greatest}} in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their rival Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won their very first World Series game. Ruth got hurt during the Series, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series. Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy named Ruffing {{to be the}} {{starting}} pitcher for the Yankees on Opening Day in 1939. McCarthy, managing the AL All-Star team that year, also selected Ruffing as his starter for the 1939 MLB All-Star Game. He missed several weeks late in the 1939 season due to an arm injury, but managed to start Game One of the 1939 World Series. He defeated the Cincinnati Redlegs in that game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> won the series in a four games to zero sweep. Ruffing won 21 games during the 1939 season. His four shutouts in the 1939 season again tied him for the AL lead, while he finished second in wins behind Bob Feller, and fourth in ERA (2.93) behind Grove, Lyons, and Feller. He finished fifth in the balloting for the AL MVP.|$|E
5000|$|As top-40 radio became {{dominant}} on AM in {{the late}} 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network continued to program for an audience that was now aging. In fact, at many stations, the programming content was undergoing a number of changes: for one thing, few stations had live orchestras any more. And with television becoming popular, many programs previously heard only on radio moved over to TV. Even soap operas, long a staple of network programming on radio, ceased in 1960. Also during this time period, many stations stopped relying on syndicated programs from NBC, CBS, ABC, or Mutual and began {{to do their own}} programming: in Boston, for example, WBZ ended its long affiliation with NBC to program its own music, using live and local announcers. Just like with WBZ, the emphasis at many radio stations had shifted to playing records. <b>And</b> as <b>the</b> top-40 hit format proliferated, in an effort to attract the growing youth audience, WNAC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network stayed with the older music; this earned them praise from a number of newspaper columnists, many of whom were also getting older and found top-40 unpleasant. For them, WNAC's <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network's emphasis on [...] "great standards" [...] and songs with [...] "beautiful melodies" [...] was very comforting. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Yankee</b> stations, especially flagship WNAC, played the music that the older audience enjoyed, avoiding songs that were popular with young people and focusing on [...] "easy listening" [...] music. [...] One popular announcer during this time was Gus Saunders, who was also well known as the host of another of <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network's cooking programs; in addition, Saunders announced some of the network's sports events, such as Boston's BAA Marathon. Another popular announcer was Vin Maloney, who like Saunders, fulfilled a wide range of functions for WNAC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network, including announcing, news-reading, <b>and</b> covering sports. <b>The</b> <b>Yankee</b> News Service remained popular throughout <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>and</b> listeners relied on it for local news and sports; this was especially true in the summer of 1957, when Boston's newspapers went on strike. WNAC, WNAC-TV, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>Yankee</b> Network increased <b>the</b> amount of hourly newscasts, added more news bulletins, and sent out members of its Boston staff to post news headlines on billboards around the city.|$|R
5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Rowe Nuclear Power Station. Nichols was involved {{with the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Rowe Nuclear Power Station, the first privately owned pressurized-water plant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Vermont <b>Yankee</b> Nuclear Power Plant, which commenced operation in 1961 and 1968 respectively. They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|R
50|$|By 1750 the North Atlantic {{right whale}} {{was as good}} as extinct for {{commercial}} purposes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> whalers moved into the South Atlantic {{before the end of the}} 18th century.

5|$|Stengel often rotated infielders between positions, {{with the}} Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees {{had a strong}} {{defensive}} infield throughout. Stengel gave great attention to the double play, both defensively and in planning his lineup, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> responded by being first {{in the league in}} double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times in that era. Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, Stengel treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by the Yankee front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.|$|E
5|$|To assist at {{practice}} for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He left the team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was involved in what {{is considered one of}} the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed to be a great hitter, even though he had hardly played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations.|$|E
5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Bob Carpenter {{replaced}} the old 1941 scoreboard in right-center {{field with a}} new, much larger board, constructed for Connie Mack Stadium. A prominent feature of the new board was the Ballantine Beer advertisement across <b>the</b> top <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Longines clock perched above it. The board's superficial resemblance to the similarly-adorned board in Yankee Stadium {{gave rise to the}} urban legend that the board was acquired second-hand from <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b> However, <b>the</b> boards differed in many details, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium board remained until 1959 when it was replaced, a few years after Connie Mack Stadium's new board had made its appearance.|$|R

5|$|After the 1998 season, Wells {{was traded}} to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, who had just {{completed}} two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first Subway Series in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2016, the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{became the}} Yankees' captain in their 2003 season. The team faced the Red Sox in the ALCS. The series {{came down to}} a seventh game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> fell behind before three eighth-inning runs forced a 5–5 tie and extra innings. Aaron Boone, a third baseman {{acquired}} by New York in a mid-season trade, hit a walk-off {{home run in the}} eleventh inning to give New York the pennant. The Yankees were then defeated by the Florida Marlins in the World Series, four games to two. The Yankees added power hitting to their lineup in the offseason, signing free agent Gary Sheffield and trading for shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who became a third baseman with New York. Three of the starting pitchers from the previous season—Clemens, Pettitte, and Wells—left the team before the season. Despite the losses, the 2004 Yankees managed to top the AL East with 101 wins and defeat the Twins three games to one in the ALDS. The victory set up an ALCS rematch with the Red Sox. The Yankees took a 3–0 series lead before losing four consecutive games, becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a best-of-seven series after winning the first three games.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Yankees {{held the}} AL East lead {{entering}} August, but faded and ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before {{the building was}} renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> were required {{to play at the}} Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees chose Ruffing {{as their}} {{starting}} pitcher for Opening Day in 1931. During the 1931 season, Ruffing had a 16–14 win-loss {{record with a}} 4.41 ERA. The Yankees finished the season in second place. On August 13, 1932, Ruffing threw a complete game shutout and {{hit a home run}} in the tenth inning off of Washington Senators' pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees a 1–0 victory. Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history to win a game 1–0, hit a home run in the game, and strike out ten or more batters. Two other pitchers have since achieved this feat: Early Wynn in 1957, and Yovani Gallardo, who did it in 2009. Ruffing won 18 games during the 1932 season. He had a 3.09ERA, second in the AL only to Lefty Grove's 2.84. Ruffing had 190 strikeouts, which led the AL. The Yankees won their first pennant since 1928. Ruffing won his first World Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. He started Game One, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> swept the Cubs four games to zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} game {{was largely a}} defensive battle with little scoring from either team. New York scored the game's first {{points in the first}} quarter on a 21-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but the Browns went into the lead in the second quarter when Marion Motley ran for a touchdown after a 70-yard drive. The Yankees retook the lead in the third quarter, marching 80 yards down the field for a Sanders touchdown. Cleveland reached the New York 18-yard line {{at the end of the}} third, but the drive stalled and Lou Groza missed a short field goal, his third failed attempt of the game. Groza had suffered a sprained left ankle, and Chet Adams substituted for him. Adams, however, missed another field goal in the fourth quarter. The Browns took the lead again in the fourth quarter when Graham passed to Lavelli for a 16-yard touchdown. Groza came back in and kicked the extra point, giving Cleveland a 14–9 advantage with 4:31 to play in the game. Sanders returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> started the drive at the Browns' 45-yard line. The Yankees appeared poised for a comeback, but Graham intercepted a pass on a third down and Cleveland was almost able to run out the clock. Time expired after a Tommy Colella punt and one short Yankees completion.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 {{he started}} his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite {{allowing}} only one run in three innings. Buoyed {{by the arrival of}} rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce's 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately before and after the All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b> He became the first White Sox pitcher since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the first White Sox pitcher since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL Pitcher of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the last five games in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago's best fielding pitcher, best pitcher at holding runners to first base, and best pitcher for crucial games, as well as the team's most nervous player on the field.|$|E
