5000|$|The {{emphasis}} on well-formed documents has developed within {{the publishing industry}} where the use of left and right <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> delimited information has become problematic. [...] Emphasis on the well-formed document allows for the definition, delimiting, and nesting of content to be managed within programs that are not XML, per se, but exhibit the characteristics or potential for being well formed.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a well-formed {{document}} allows for {{a better understanding of}} the fundamental construction of XML. It helps to clarify XML beyond the typical sense of it. For example, while most XML Document Type Definitions utilize left and right angle brackets as content delimiters, strictly speaking this is not a necessity (though a delimiter should be terse and concise). The left and right <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> codes are a convention, albeit clear and distinctive, not an absolute requirement.|$|E
50|$|The document, as {{published}} and emended by Schwartz in 1905 here follows. The leftmost column indicates the AD year assigned by Schwartz. The {{second and third}} columns transcribe the tables found in the manuscript. In these columns, square and angle brackets indicate Schwartz's emendations. In the numerals, a square bracket emendation indicates a character or characters that Schwartz thought should be deleted, while an <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> emendation indicates where Schwartz thought characters should be added. A note in square brackets with the letters MS indicate that the entire preceding word is Schwartz's emendation, and the word in brackets is the original.|$|E

5000|$|In a dictionary, the lemma [...] "go" [...] {{represents}} the inflected forms [...] "go", [...] "goes", [...] "going", [...] "went", and [...] "gone". The relationship between an inflected form and its lemma is usually denoted by an <b>angle</b> <b>bracket,</b> e.g., [...] "went" [...] < [...] "go". The disadvantage of such simplifications is, of course, {{the inability to}} look up a declined or conjugated form of the word, although some dictionaries, like Webster's, will list [...] "went". Multilingual dictionaries vary in how they deal with this issue: the Langenscheidt dictionary of German does not list ging (< gehen); the Cassell does.|$|E
5000|$|Delimiter {{collision}} is {{a problem}} that occurs when an author or programmer introduces delimiters into text without actually intending them to be interpreted as boundaries between separate regions. In the case of XML, for example, this can occur whenever an author attempts to specify an <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> character. In most file types there is both a field delimiter and a record delimiter, both of which are subject to collision. In the case of comma-separated values files, for example, field collision can occur whenever an author attempts to include a comma as part of a field value (e.g., salary = [...] "$30,000"), and record delimiter collision would occur whenever a field contained multiple lines. Both record and field delimiter collision occur frequently in text files.|$|E

Apostrophes and similar have to be omitted, but hyphens and spaces should be replaced by an <b>angle</b> <b>bracket.</b> Diacritical marks are not permitted in the MRZ. Even though they may be useful to distinguish names, the use of diacritical marks in the MRZ could confuse machine-reading equipment.|$|E
50|$|Entry {{and exit}} stamps {{are placed in}} {{passports}} regardless of citizenship; Russian passports are stamped as well as foreign ones, except the Internal Passports, with which Russian citizens may travel to a few countries of the CIS. The stamp shows {{the name of the}} country (КПП below the country name stands for checkpoint - контрольно-пропускной пункт), the date, the name of the checkpoint and the personal code of the immigration official applying the stamp. Stamp colours and series (the last number following the date) change every time in few years, currently the colour of the stamps is blue of 6 series, but it can be orange or crimson as well. Entry or exit is designated by a direction of an <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> in the stamp: if it points to the right, that denotes exit. Ukrainian passport stamps are identical to the Russian stamps and have the same information. They can be stamped in green, red, orange, blue, pink and sometimes black ink.|$|E
5000|$|For {{position}} control {{in more than}} one direction, multiple linear stages may be used together. A [...] "two-axis" [...] or [...] "X-Y" [...] stage can be assembled from two linear stages, one mounted to the platform of the other such that the axis of motion of the second stage is perpendicular to that of the first. A two-axis stage with which many people are familiar is a microscope stage, used to position a slide under a lens. A [...] "three-axis" [...] or [...] "X-Y-Z" [...] stage is composed of three linear stages mounted to each other (often with the use of an additional <b>angle</b> <b>bracket)</b> such that the axes of motion of all stages are orthogonal. Some two-axis and three-axis stages are integrated designs rather than being assembled from separate single-axis stages. Some multiple-axis stages also include rotary or tilt elements such as rotary stages or positioning goniometers. By combining linear and rotary elements in various ways, four-axis, five-axis, and six-axis stages are also possible.|$|E
