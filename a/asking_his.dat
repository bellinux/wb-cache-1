5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants.

The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia.
