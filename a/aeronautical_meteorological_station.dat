40|$|The {{automation}} of synoptic and aviation weather observations is {{a global}} trend. In planning the transition from manual observations by human observers {{to the use of}} instrumented readings, either as an aid to or as a replacement of manual observations, the representativeness of instrumented readings vis-à-vis those of human observers and the assurance of continuity of the climatological records are two major challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges were dealt with in the introduction of instruments for visibility observations at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) {{in the past several years}}. HKIA is located in a coastal environment with complex terrain in the vicinity. Apart from being an <b>aeronautical</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> for issuing METARs in support of civil aviation, the airport meteorological office at HKIA also serves as the SYNOP station in Hong Kong. A dense network of six forward scatterers was installed along the two runways in HKIA in 2002 and the readings have been operationally used for both METAR and SYNOP reporting since late 2004. A study of the data in the past several years showed that the readings from these six sensors could sometimes be affected by localized events (e. g. fog patches). As it is necessary to report...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>station.</b> The <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> is designed and constructed {{to be able to}} measure the basic meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure) and the other three variables (measuring rainfall, wind speed, wind direction). This thesis will introduce you to meteorology. Meteorology determines the daily weather forecast and the results are used for examples in aviation or maritime affairs. The method of atmospheric origin is given in the theoretical part. Meteorology must use measuring instruments to determine quantities. The dissertation also includes analysis of the measuring instruments. The <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> uses the Ethernet technology. In the chapter devoted to Ethernet are described its principles, types and method of power supply over Ethernet. The following section describes the design of the entire <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> selection of all components and description of their connection. The chapter about implementation contains a description of the parts which forms program part of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>station.</b> The aim of the thesis is a summary of the achieved results including price comparison of the renovated <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> with other <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> which can be normally bought...|$|R

The urban heat island of the city has also been found to be partially responsible for alterations of the climatological temperature time-series of specific Athens <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> because of its impact on the temperatures and the temperature trends recorded by some <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> On the other hand, specific <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> such as the National Garden <b>station</b> and Thiseio <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> are less affected or do not experience the urban heat island.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> is {{important}} for meteorological observation {{and the existence of}} outliers in the observational data is inevitable. The paper proposes outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> based on least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The method establishes the LS-SVM model for the meteorological factor and uses the model to evaluate the observational data. If the observational data deviate from the model, they would be seemed as outliers. The ground temperature data observed by two real automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> are used in experiments. Experiments results verify that the proposed method realize outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> effectively and ensures subsequent process and analysis of the meteorological data...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, five {{national}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> in Anhui province {{are taken}} as typical examples {{to explore the}} effects of local urbanization on their thermal environment by using Landsat data from 1990 to 2010. Satellite-based land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to investigate the effects. The study shows that LULC around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> changed significantly due to urban expansion. Fast urbanization is the main factor that affects the spatial-temporal distribution of thermal environment around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, the normalized LST and NDVI exhibit strong inverse correlations around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> so the variability of LST can be monitored through evaluating the variability of NDVI. In addition, station-relocation {{plays an important role}} in improving representativeness of thermal environment. Notably, the environment representativeness was improved, but when using the data from the station to study climate change, the relocation-induced inhomogeneous data should be considered and adjusted. Consequently, controlling the scale and layout of the urban buildings and constructions around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> is an effective method to ameliorate observational thermal environment and to improve regional representativeness of station observation. The present work provides observational evidences that high resolution Landsat images can be used to evaluate the thermal environment of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
