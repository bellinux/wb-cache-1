25|$|Due to {{objections}} from concerned residents {{it became more}} and more difficult to dispose of the ashes of burned household garbage in and around Tokyo. The ashes of waste facilities in the Tohoku, Kanto and Kōshin'etsu regions were proven to be contaminated with radioactive cesium. According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Environment, ashes radiating 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower could be buried. Ashes with cesium levels between 8,000 and 100,000 becquerels should be secured, and buried in concrete vessels. A survey was done on 410 sites of waste-disposal facilities, on how the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> was proceeding. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 becquerels could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. At 42 sites, ashes were found that contained over 8,000 becquerels of cesium, which could not be buried. The ministry made plans to send officials to meetings in the municipalities to explain to the Japanese people that the waste disposal was done safely, and to demonstrate how the disposal of the ashes above 8000 becquerels was conducted.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring operation, {{the coal}} power plant {{produces}} solid waste (bottom and fly ash) and uncontrolled <b>ashes</b> <b>disposal</b> could lead to environmental contamination. Major and trace elements (Al, Fe, Ti, Ca, Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Zn, V) were determined in coal and ashes of the power plant of Figueira (Brazil) and their mobility evaluated by total and available metal concentration ratio. The total concentration was determined by WDXRF technique and the available concentration (after extraction with EDTA) by ICP-OES technique. The results showed a high total concentration for As and Zn (average 270 and 391 mgkg− 1) in coal and (average 974 and 1330 mgkg− 1) in fly ashes. The high mobility of As (> 70 %), followed by Mo (> 55 %) and next by Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb (30 – 5 %) in ash can cause environmental impact.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the pioneering work of various {{researchers in the}} field of slurry erosion behaviour of uncoated and coated materials in various industrial applications. The present study is focused on the slurry erosion behaviour of <b>ash</b> slurry <b>disposal</b> system of thermal power plants. The key components such as impeller and casing of <b>ash</b> slurry <b>disposal</b> pumps in thermal power plants experience this phenomenon of wear. Tribological parameters such as solid particle concentration, impact velocity of erodent on the target surface, impact angle, erodent particle size and shape, hardness of the striking particles and target material, etc. are responsible for slurry erosion. The research results show that the influence of tribological parameters on the slurry erosion is found to be significant and need to be evaluated and analyzed properly. The slurry erosion can be minimized by proper selection of materials and/or by providing the suitable protective coating on the material which can enhance the surface properties. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Installation {{of solar}} power PV plants require nearly 2.0 {{hectares}} (5 acres) land per MW capacity {{which is similar}} to coal-fired power plants [...] when life cycle coal mining, consumptive water storage & <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> areas are also accounted and hydro power plants when submergence area of water reservoir is also accounted. 1.6 million MW capacity solar plants can be installed in India on its 1% land (32,000 square km). There are vast tracts of land suitable for solar power in all parts of India exceeding 8% of its total area which are unproductive barren and devoid of vegetation. Part of waste lands (32,000 square km) when installed with solar power plants can produce 2400 billion kWh of electricity (two times the total generation in 2013-14) with land productivity/yield of 0.9 million Rs per acre (3 Rs/kWh price) which is at par with many industrial areas and many times more than the best productive irrigated agriculture lands. Moreover, these solar power units are not dependent on supply of any raw material and are self productive. There is unlimited scope for solar electricity to replace all fossil fuel energy requirements (natural gas, coal, lignite and crude oil) if all the marginally productive lands are occupied by solar power plants in future. The solar power potential of India can meet perennially to cater per capita energy consumption at par with USA/Japan for the peak population in its demographic transition.|$|E

40|$|Under {{controlled}} conditions waste-to-energy {{plants are}} very useful systems to dispose solid wastes {{in combination with}} energy production. For common urban wastes, hence excluding special wastes, the incineration products are fly and heavy ashes where heavy metals are concentrated due to their impossibility to be vaporized. Those metals are usually lost because up to now the common <b>ashes</b> <b>disposal</b> methods have been cement or clay inertization or simple ashes storage in safe places. In order to recover those otherwise lost valuable and useful heavy metals we present {{the concept of an}} electromagnetic device able to separate and collect the different atomic species. The proposed device is essentially composed by an atomization stage followed by a separation one. The former atomizes and ionizes ash components allowing the second stage to perform separation of the desired metals by means of an electromagnetic field. Power dissipation represents one of the major issues of such devices due to the high power required to perform species separation. In this paper the major power sources and losses are also identified...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{are essential for}} a range of soil functions and adjust to soil development, environmental conditions and pollution level by community structure, abundance and activity. At desolated landfills of coal combustion waste (CCW) that were un-covered and covered with shallow soil material layers, soil microbial indicators were estimated for both the ecological and eco-toxicological evaluation. The young CCW sites with pH values of 9. 5 and substantial coal-derived organic carbon showed significant microbial biomass content and nitrogen mineralization rates. At the 0 to 15 year old landfills, the microbial biomass content and activities increased significantly with age. However, large spatial variations occurred due to the variation of the cover material thickness, the degree of ash-aging and the tillage practices. Carbon dioxide was even sequestered at young CCW sites as indicated during laboratory incubation with an open apparatus purging continuously ambient air. In accordance, the respiratory quotient went down to 0. 03 mol CO(2) evolution rate per mol O(2) uptake rate, indicating that the CO(2) evolution rate is limited as an overall quality indicator. Within 15 years, these 'Technosols' showed pH values of 7. 7 and decalcified while changes in microbial biomass content and activity rates were mainly related to N availability. We concluded that the available As, B, Cr and Ni pollution at CCW sites seemed largely immobilised by organic matter and alkalinity and therefore did not to inhibit the microbial colonisation and development of high microbial activity within 15 years. However, the <b>ash</b> <b>disposals</b> pose a contamination risk by wind erosion and a future risk to human or environmental health when toxic metals will be released in soil at low pH values, low organic matter and low antagonistic ion contents...|$|R
