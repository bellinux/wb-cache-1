5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need <b>a</b> <b>respirator.</b> Otis {{suggests}} that they might find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them into a small enclosed space known as <b>a</b> <b>Respirator</b> Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators {{so that they are}} exposed to the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E

5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping to put on <b>a</b> <b>respirator,</b> nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is {{able to keep up}} with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Maria never {{approached}} any land areas while {{a tropical}} system, but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10. The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12, where tropical storm-force winds were reported. The strongest winds {{were recorded in}} Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67mph (107km/h) were reported {{as well as a}} minimum pressure of 979 mbar. The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland, with no reported damage there either. The extratropical Maria merged with another system and this storm made landfall in Norway. This storm brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to that country, and caused flooding and several mudslides, particularly around Bergen, the most important of which occurred in Hatlestad. One person was killed immediately, at least nine others were injured, and numerous homes were destroyed. Marine interests were also affected, as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea. On September 18, a woman died of injuries. Her daughter died on February 7, 2006, after having been kept alive in <b>a</b> <b>respirator</b> since the accident.|$|E

25|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture.

He was discovered by his mother, who was not aware of his dependence on heroin. She contacted his wife Caroline, who knew about it and immediately identified the problem as serious. After Caroline drove him to a drug clinic at Clouds House in East Knoyle, near Warminster, he was taken to Salisbury Infirmary where he was diagnosed as suffering from septicaemia. Although he regained consciousness enough to speak to his mother, his condition worsened by the start of the new year and he was put on <b>a</b> <b>respirator.</b> He died of pneumonia and heart failure due to septicaemia in the hospital's intensive care unit on 4 January 1986, at the age of 36.|$|E
