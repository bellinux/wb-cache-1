5|$|Nikephoros was {{the father}} of Bardas Phokas the Elder <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Phokas the Elder, both of whom became Domestics of the Schools. So did his grandsons through Bardas, Nikephoros <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Phokas the Younger, with the first {{becoming}} emperor as Nikephoros II in 963–969. Both Leo and Nikephoros II scored major successes against the Arabs, with Nikephoros in particular leading the recovery of Crete, Cyprus, Cilicia and Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Will's (Eric McCormack) apartment, Grace <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> reveal to their friends, Will, Jack (Sean Hayes), and Karen (Megan Mullally), {{that they have}} gotten married. The friends' reactions to the news are not positive; in particular, Grace's gay best friend Will is uneasy about the whole idea. Leo and Grace, however, assure Will {{that they will have}} a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace <b>and</b> <b>Leo.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Palestinian {{suicide bomber}} in Jerusalem causes {{the death of}} several Israelis, {{as well as two}} American nationals. National Security Advisor Nancy McNally <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> {{consider}} the potential implications of possible retributions and are relieved when the Palestinians respond to American pressure by arresting a leader of a militant group. As Leo points out, however, the solution is likely to be only temporary.|$|E

5|$|Eustathios' sons Pothos <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> {{would go}} on to hold senior {{military}} commands, including the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief). Another son, Romanos, is known only from his participation in the Battle of Achelous in 917. Leo Argyros married a daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), and was probably the grandfather or great-grandfather of Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–1034).|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein <b>and</b> <b>Leó</b> Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In May 1191 Bohemond {{sailed to}} Limassol along with Guy of Lusignan <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> of Cilicia to meet Richard I of England, {{who had arrived}} to reconquer the Holy Land from Saladin. He once again met Richard during the siege of Acre in summer 1191, {{but he did not}} provide {{military}} support to the crusaders. Bohemond's relationship with Leo of Cilicia became tense when Leo captured Bagras and refused to cede it to the Knights Templar.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass escapes {{the plant}} in a gas mask and meets up with Leo, whom he finds {{unconscious}} in his car nearby. With little time left to prevent more ammonids returning in meteorites, he <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> are forced to use the Quatermass II to attempt to destroy the asteroid, despite the known flaws in the rocket's design and its liability to explode. They return to the Rocket Group, but British Paratroopers led by Johnny Dillon {{take control of the}} firing base.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{probably}} {{took place}} at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic Theme. From there, the rebel army, comprising almost half of the Empire's available military forces, marched north and west, following the military road to Nicomedia and then to Chrysopolis, the town that lay across the Bosporus from the imperial capital, Constantinople. There, Bardanes encamped for eight days, awaiting a possible uprising against Nikephoros inside the capital in response to his own rebellion. Since this did not materialize, and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic, he withdrew to the great army base at Malagina. There, two of his associates, Michael the Amorian <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> the Armenian, abandoned him, and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection: Michael became Count of the Tent to the Emperor, <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> was appointed commander of the Foederati regiment.|$|E

5|$|After {{releasing}} Clannad, Jun Maeda {{decided to}} make a game based on Tomoyo's scenario from Clannad. Maeda handled the game's planning and scenario, <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Kashida, a new member of the team, accompanied him. As opposed to Itaru Hinoue who was the character designer and art director for Clannad, Fumio was the art director for Tomoyo After, while Hinoue helped Fumio with the character design. As such, characters who appeared in Clannad such as Tomoya and Tomoyo look similar but visibly different from when in Clannad. Maeda also composed the music for the game along with Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the date}} {{specified}} above, more than 500 players had completed their York career before reaching the 25-match milestone. Many of these players spent only {{a short period of}} their careers at York before seeking opportunities in other teams. Players who have gone on to experience football in the English top tier include Chris Iwelumo, when playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Neil Warnock, when managing Notts County, Sheffield United, Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. At international level, Iwelumo went on to represent Scotland <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Bertos became the first former York player to represent his country at a FIFA World Cup when appearing for New Zealand at the 2010 tournament. Four players with under 25 appearances went on to manage the club; these were Jock Collier, Tom Mitchell, Viv Busby and Steve Torpey.|$|E
5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, {{who had worked with}} Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Yaffe.|$|E

5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{continued}} {{to tinker with}} his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond's vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, {{without his}} authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the {{confiscation}} of Renoart's fiefs. However, {{he decided to}} resist and gained the support of Leo of Cilicia and Aimery, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne. Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E

5|$|In January, the Taça de Portugal {{started for}} Benfica; they {{entered in the}} fourth round and played with Oliveira do Bairro from the third tier. As Rui Costa {{recovered}} from various injuries, Santos implemented a diamond formation with Costa supporting two strikers. Benfica put five goals past Oliveira do Bairro and advanced to the fifth round. Santos attributed the win to his players' attitude {{in the presence of}} an inferior opponent. Benfica's next match on 15 January was a visit to Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. Ricardo Rocha scored the opening goal for Benfica in the second minute <b>and</b> <b>Léo</b> scored the second in the 89th minute, ending the match 0–0 to Benfica. Santos called the match a great spectacle played at high-speed and where the win could have fallen for either side.|$|E
5|$|James {{was born}} on December 22, 1964, in Toronto, Ontario.

She has two half-brothers and two half-sisters on her mother's side. Her father, who was involved with a Toronto nightclub, estimates she has at least nine half-siblings by him, though James believes the number is closer to 15. Among them is National Hockey League (NHL) player Theo Peckham.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Cattarinich <b>and</b> <b>Leo</b> Dandurand, {{owners of}} the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s, led the {{participating}} ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport. In the 1930s, 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks. Canadians adopted the {{new version of the}} sport quickly. Eventually it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada, supplanting field lacrosse. This form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples., It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally, participating as the Iroquois Nationals. However, many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity.|$|E
