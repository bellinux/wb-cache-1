5|$|Wind power {{forecasting}} {{methods are}} used, but predictability of <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> wind farm is low for short-term operation. For <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> generator {{there is an}} 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% {{in an hour and}} a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.|$|E

5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the Caribbean, United States and Canada, the name Hazel was retired, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. However, since it was retired before the {{inception}} of naming lists with the modern six-year cycle, it was not directly replaced with <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> name.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> name. As a result of this, {{this is the only}} time the name Ione was used for the Atlantic Basin since hurricane naming began in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} {{loss of life}} caused by the storm, the name Lucille was retired. This {{marked the first time}} that a tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific had its name removed following its usage. For unknown reasons it was not replaced with <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> name, making it one of two storms in the basin to not have a replacement, although Lucy took the name's place in 1962.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{give you}} <b>any</b> <b>particulars.</b> We were taken {{completely}} by surprise, {{and it was}} too dark to see much," [...] said Tom. Nevertheless he and Sam told what they could, to which the freight captain listened with close attention.|$|R

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Sheshi is {{mentioned}} in the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC {{during the reign of}} Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. Indeed, the Aegyptiaca only reports Hellenized names for Egyptian pharaohs and the identification of Sheshi with <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> name remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{aiming at}} {{originality}} of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> and previous writing, {{it was intended}} to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Sustainment Brigade was {{permanently}} {{attached to}} the 1st Cavalry Division, though it could operate independently when needed. Currently, it falls under {{the organization of the}} 1st Armored Division, having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005.

25|$|The short certificate, titled 'CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH', {{shows the}} child’s full name, sex, {{date and place}} of birth. It does not give <b>any</b> <b>particulars</b> of the parents; {{therefore}} it is not proof of parentage. A short birth certificate is issued, free of charge, {{at the time of}} registration.|$|R
6000|$|... “She is a European ship,” {{the captain}} said as they neared her. “Send an officer in a boat to row round her and gather <b>any</b> <b>particulars</b> as to her fate. I see no boats near her, and I am afraid {{that it is the}} work of those pirates.” ...|$|R
5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} {{compromised}} by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> prejudice against Islam. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|The integument, or body covering, of Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from a Chinese specimen, which most likely {{comes from the}} Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, China.

It was described while awaiting repatriation.|$|E
5|$|Through the Wilderness is a psychedelic-folk {{tribute to}} Madonna without {{adhering}} to <b>any</b> <b>particular</b> coherent sound. The cover songs were composed {{differently from the}} original versions by the performers; they changed the melody of the Madonna tracks by tweaking the lyrics and re-interpreting the actual meaning. Music critics both complimented and criticized the songs, noting the strength of Madonna's discography in the album's track list.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} {{change their minds}} about that. And, by the way, we were right about that money in Boston. Roland got that, and he had that lost letter, too. Guardley {{admitted}} it, although he didn't give me <b>any</b> <b>particulars.</b> He is trying to lay the blame of everything on Roland." ...|$|R

They handle the incoming commissions, and then disburses the funds accordingly. In return for their services the paymaster charges a small fee, which is paid directly to {{them out of the}} commission proceeds prior to disbursement.|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that {{reporting}} restrictions imposed by judges take precedence over the PCC's code. For example, under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, victims (even alleged victims) of sexual offences have lifetime anonymity. This means that a newspaper cannot print <b>any</b> <b>particulars</b> leading to the identification of a sexual offence victim.|$|R
