If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

5000|$|Around {{the year}} 2007, Ritter began to sense a {{cultural}} shift toward tolerance, {{even in the}} most conservative states where his books are most popular, and began testing the waters toward a public disclosure of his true inspiration. In a January 2007 interview in a newsletter published online by Brodart Books, he was asked, [...] "Do you ever feel that the self-given title of ‘baseball novelist’ is inhibiting, that it corners you into one genre?" [...] Ritter responded, [...] "This might be hard to understand, but being called a baseball novelist actually gives me a certain unique freedom among writers. I slip under the radar of <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> because of that title, and it allows me to reach an audience who would most likely never pick up a book about religious based bigotry Choosing Up Sides or the cowardice of war Over the Wall or one that demonizes anti-environmental developers The Boy Who Saved Baseball, and so on, if I didn’t write under the cover of baseball." [...] At this point, Ritter began to openly acknowledge and discuss the metaphorical underpinnings of Choosing Up Sides in schools and conferences across the country.|$|E
5000|$|Barbara Grofe of RP Online {{wrote in}} an early review: [...] "Talents are little to see, but <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with ego problems". In another review, it was criticized that also {{children}} {{at a very young}} age can present their talents. The youth protection also takes a close eye on the show for years now. Next to that, it has been highly criticized in recent seasons that candidates with no real talent are presented to the audience after a pre-casting to humiliate these people and push the ratings. Christian Richter writes about the show that the [...] "performances are artificially drawn in the length" [...] and the candidates [...] "tell their personal tragic story with overly dramatic music", even repeating the crucial scenes again in slow motion. Richter goes on saying that [...] "RTL characterizes the term 'Emotainments'". It was also published by the Bild as [...] "super cheating" [...] that RTL paid some of their talents money for their participation in the show.In spite of the critics, the show is very popular among viewers. In 2010, Das Supertalent also won the Golden Camera award as Best Entertainment Show.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, {{when asked}} what his {{favourite}} Cardiacs album is by Popular I Magazine, Tim Smith said [...] "I like them all for their own reasons. Sorry.

A lot of people seem {{to think it was}} a bit of an accident." [...] Similarly, asked in 2001 if Sing to God was his favourite Cardiacs album, Smith said [...] "No… I sort of like them all in one way or another….a funny thing is that the album our fans seem to dislike the most is one that I am very proud of…. the ‘Heaven Born And Ever Bright’ album which we did back in 1991…it’s got a really weird sound to it…I reckon all our albums sound completely different to each other anyway…unless you hate the stuff and then I suppose they will all sound exactly the same….and shit…and there’s <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who share that opinion." ...|$|E

[...] Ian Cranna of Smash Hits described it as [...] "looser, more exploratory than before" [...] in nature, and noted its [...] "unflinching lyrical honesty". Rolling Stone critic Don Shewey wrote that Tears for Fears [...] "sounds a lot like a lot of other British bands" [...] and observed traces of [...] "U2's social conscience, the Bunnymen's echoing guitars and XTC's contorted pop wit" [...] on the album, but commented that Chris Hughes' production [...] "nudges Songs from the Big Chair slightly ahead of the pack." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his review for The Village Voice, observing some substantial lyrics, particularly on [...] "The Working Hour", and musical elements such as an [...] "uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility". However, he felt these are all beneath grandiloquent lamentations suggesting [...] "a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock." ...|$|E
