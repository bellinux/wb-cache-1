5000|$|Applicants {{have the}} choice of {{investing}} individually or they can choose to work through a [...] "larger investor pool via regional centers (RC)", which are federally <b>approved</b> third-party <b>intermediaries</b> that [...] "connect foreign investors with developers in need of funding, and take a commission." [...] Regional centers are usually private, for-profit businesses that are approved by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) {{which is part of}} the Department of Homeland Security. By May 1, 2017, there were 883 USCIS-approved regional centers and by 2014 the [...] "vast majority" [...] of EB-5 visas were [...] "granted through regional centers". By 2015 the EB-5 program had become an [...] "important source of capital for developers" [...] and for the regional centers. If an EB-5 investment is made in a regional center, the jobs may be created indirectly through economic activity, as opposed to a direct investment, where the investment vehicle must directly employ the 10 U.S. workers.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{packages}} give {{funding to}} a person with disability to live how they choose. The NSW Department of Family and Community Services, Ageing, Disability and Home Care (ADHC) commissioned the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at UNSW to design an evaluation framework and collect data for the accommodation support and funding models under Stronger Together Two (ST 2). The evaluation used longitudinal, mixed methods and a participatory research approach. The evaluation includes nine SAEF options grouped in four types: Individual packages, Drop-in support, Group accommodation and Other. This report is about the implementation and use of individual packages: Supported Living Fund (SLF) and Individual Accommodation Support Packages (IASP). There {{are two types of}} individual packages: Supported Living Fund 	The Supported Living Fund is about making a plan to live in a way that suits you. 	People with disability make the plan with help from family, friends and a Support Planner. Individual Accommodation Support Packages 	Individual Accommodation Support Packages are about making support networks and getting the resources for you to live as independently as possible. 	It is for people with medium to high support needs. 	People with disability make a plan with help from family, friends and a case manager or service provider. People who received SLF or IASP nominated and worked with an ADHC <b>approved</b> financial <b>intermediary</b> service provider to administer and manage the package. People who used the packages were not tied to any one service provider or living arrangement, rather the funding was portable throughout NSW and remained with the person, administered by a service provider of their choice. The service provider might provide support services or broker services and would charge an administrative fee to manage the package. Â ...|$|R
