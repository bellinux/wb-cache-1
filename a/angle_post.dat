40|$|This {{prospective}} study implied a two-year follow-up {{on a group}} of patients that underwent a Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy (BSSO) for advancement (n= 222) of the mandible that were treated in seven institutions following the same treatment protocol. The aim of Part II {{of this study was to}} correlate the clinical findings on stability and relapse as reported in Part I (clinical parameters) of this series of articles with the cephalometric findings. The mean skeletal relapse at pogonion of the whole group after two years was 0. 9 mm. The clinically stable group, however, had only 0. 4 mm relapse, whereas the clinical relapse group showed a mean relapse of 3. 3 mm. The findings underline a relationship between the amount of advancement and relapse. The tendency for both, horizontal and vertical movement is the same, i. e., the larger the surgery effect, the larger the relapse. The <b>angle</b> <b>post</b> plane/mandibular plane showed the highest explained variance 9 %. Patients with a high mandibular plane angle may be more prone to relapse. The explained variance of all considered prognostic factors together, however, is small (13 %). The findings of this study express that patients with a clinical stable occlusion after a BSSO advancement, stabilised with miniplates, have a minimal to no skeletal relapse as measured on the cephalometric radiograms. The clinically non-stable group, however, appeared to have considerable skeletal relapse...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A sample of 75 subjects were categorized as Class I (Group I), II (Group II), and III (Group III) based on ANB angle, Beta angle, and Wits appraisal. The YEN angle and W angle were measured for each patient in all the three groups on a lateral cephalogram. ANOVA analysis, post hoc assessment, and correlation coefficient analysis were done. Results: Mean value of YEN angle for Class I, II, and III groups was 119. 79 (± 3. 575), 112. 08 (± 6. 606), and 128. 67 (± 4. 63) degrees, respectively. Mean value of W angle for Class I, II, and III groups was 54. 5 (± 4. 09), 47. 5 (± 6. 679), and 55. 33 (± 6. 041) degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variance was found to be least for YEN angle followed by the W angle. The ANOVA analysis revealed highly significant differences among the means of all the three Groups (Group I, Group II, and Group III) for YEN angle and between Group I and II for W <b>angle.</b> <b>Post</b> hoc assessment revealed that YEN angle significantly differentiated among the three groups whereas W angle failed to differentiate between Group I and Group III. Pearson′s correlation test revealed that YEN angle and W angle were highly correlated. Conclusion: YEN angle with the least coefficient of variance was the most homogenously distributed parameter to assess the anteroposterior dysplasia. In addition, it could significantly differentiate among the three groups and was highly correlated to ANB, Wits, and W angle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — According to {{the seven}} {{degrees of freedom}} (DOFs) human arm model {{composed}} of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, positioning of the wrist in space and orientating the palm is a task requiring only six DOFs. Due to this redundancy, a given task can be completed by multiple arm configurations, {{and there is no}} unique mathematical solution to the inverse kinematics. The redundancy of a wearable robotic system (exoskeleton) that interacts with the human is expected to be resolved {{in the same way as}} that of the human arm. A unique solution to the system’s redundancy was introduced by combining both kinematic and dynamic criteria. The redundancy of the arm is expressed mathematically by defining the swivel angle: the rotation angle of the plane including the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints which are fixed in space. Two different swivel angles were generated based on kinematic and dynamic constraints. The kinematic criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. The dynamic criterion is to minimize the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. These two criteria were then combined linearly with different weight factors for estimating the swivel <b>angle.</b> <b>Post</b> processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted swivel angle and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees.

40|$|The human arm {{including}} the shoulder, elbow, wrist joints and exclusion scapular motion has seven degrees of freedom(DOF) while positioning the wrist {{in space and}} orientating the palm is a task that requires six DOF. Given the redundant nature of the arm which has one more DOF than is needed to complete the task, multiple arm configurations {{can be used to}} complete a task based on none unique solution for the inverse kinematics. Despite this mathematical difficulty, the human motor control provides an unique solution for the arm redundancy as the arm moves in space. Resolving this redundancy is becoming critical as the human interacts with a wearable robotic system(exoskeleton) which includes the same redundancy as the human arm. Therefore, the inverse kinematics solution resolving the redundancy of these two coupled systems must be identical in order to guarantee a seamless integration. Creating a proper control scheme between a wearable robot and human arm starts from an understanding of the redundant nature of the human arm. The redundancy of the arm can be formulated kinematically by defining the swivel angle - the rotation angle of the plane {{including the}} upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints fixed in space. Then a global exoskeleton robot control scheme targeted for the natural human robot interaction will be achieved by providing a robot with the precise swivel angle estimation for the given kinematic and dynamic states of the human arm. In order for this, we first study human motor control mechanism for the simple reaching and grasping tasks from a kinematic point of view. Analyzing reaching tasks recorded with a motion capture system indicates that the swivel angle, which defines the redundancy of the human arm, is selected such that when the elbow joint is flexed, the palm moves toward the head for any wrist position. Based on these experimental results, a new criterion to resolve the human arm redundancy is formed and this criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. For more realistic and natural human arm movement, we additionally considered the redundancy based on the dynamic criterion which minimizes the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. The the swivel angles from the kinematic and dynamic criteria were linearly combined with different weight factors for the unified the swivel <b>angle.</b> <b>Post</b> processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted swivel angle and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees. This result outperformed the prediction based on a single criteria and showed that the kinematic constraint is dominant in a simple reaching and grasping tasks that frequently occurs in our daily life. In order to define the redundancy resolution mechanism for more generalized human arm movement, the effect of the wrist orientation on the redundancy of the human arm was superimposed onto the wrist position based swivel angle estimation. By applying the above inverse kinematics mechanism mimicking the natural human arm movement to the wearable robot, wearer can expect the synchronized movement with robot for unconstrained natural human arm movements. Finally, to accommodate the unnatural movement pattern such as avoiding obstacle, purely reactive task space admittance control based on multiple force sensors is combined with the above control schemes for a global exoskeleton robot control scheme. Five subjects performed a peg in hole task for three different target locations to verify the performance of the proposed control scheme. The velocities and interaction forces at the upper arm, lower arm, handle and tip were recorded during the experiments. Power exchange between the subject and device was calculated for performance evaluation. Result shows that proposed control scheme outperforms purely reactive task space admittance control with energy exchange lowered by 11. 22 %. Based on the proposed exoskeleton control scheme, the exoskeleton robot is applied to the stroke patient rehabilitation research project as a clinical trial. In order for this, 3 -D video games directly interacting with the robotic system were designed and the assistive force mechanism for the patients was implemented in the exoskeleton robot. In addition a new metric called instantaneous efficiency(IE) was established to evaluate the therapeutic improvement. This metric is designed to reveal the degree of patient's improvement in terms of natural human arm movements by looking at the joint angle configuration, speed and frequency of using uncomfortable joints comprehensively. As their movements are getting closer to the natural human arm movement of normal people, the IE index increases. Ten subjects participated in this pilot research project either as an unilateral or a bilateral therapy group for six weeks. Results shows that even in a short six weeks rehabilitation program, patients' fugl-meyer scores as well as the efficiency index of the movements were significantly improved...|$|E

Speed data at each curve was collected at four points along the curve including {{the midpoint of the}} curve for a minimum of 48 hours during weekdays. Vehicle speed was analyzed separately for day and night conditions. The horizontal curves were categorized into different groups using different methods using side friction demand, radius and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity. In the speed prediction model, radius, superelevation at the midpoint of the curve, deflection <b>angle,</b> <b>posted</b> speed limit and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity were used to predict the vehicle speed at the midpoint of the horizontal curve. The regression analysis indicates that all of these variables are statistically significant in predicting the vehicle speed at the midpoint of horizontal curves with a 95 percent confidence interval. The linear model determined that the vehicle speed has a positive relation with the radius of the curve, superelevation and posted speed limit but has a negative relation with the deflection angle and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity. Curves were categorized based on side friction demand or radius and retroreflectivity of pavement edgeline marking. ANOVA was used to compare the day and night time speed. The comparisons reveal that vehicle speed at the horizontal curves decreases as the side friction demand value of the curves increases. Another finding of this research was that even though the posted speed limit is incorporated into the calculation of side friction demand, {{it may be necessary to}} analyze the impact of posted speed limit on vehicle speed for both daytime and nighttime. Previous literature determined that drivers may drive at an unsafe speed during nighttime at high levels of retroreflectivity. The results of this study could not confirm this statement as data from this study suggests that for curves with pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity greater than 90 mcd/m 2 /lx, the effects of retroreflectivity on speed was determined to be minimal. This is based on the finding that the daytime and nighttime speeda were basically the same as the daytime and nighttime speed difference was both statistically and practically insignificant...|$|R

The mechanics of floppy iris syndrome and pupil block have not been discussed. Methods: We evaluated the various forces competing within the anterior chamber via mathematical modelling and computational simulation, and considered the influence of floppy iris on pupil block glaucoma. Results: Energy formulae suggest a critical pressure value will maintain normal anterior chamber relationships, above which abnormal iris buckling may occur. This mechanical instability can be influenced intraoperatively by abnormal iris properties and intracameral forces (such as air). This critical value is lowered if the patient has a floppy iris (because of a lower elastic modulus, a mechanical measure of iris rigidity). To demonstrate this mathematical concept, a 3 -D computational model was built. Simulations show that, as intracameral pressure increases, the iris ring can buckle into predictable modes of shapes. Conclusion: This model shows how iris buckling could occur with an intracameral air bubble leading to posterior iris displacement and mechanical pupil block. It also shows that abnormal iris behaviour in IFIS is consistent with the expected predicted buckling of an elastic disc...|$|R
