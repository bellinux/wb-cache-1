In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.|$|E
2500|$|The Radley-England Waterplane was a four-bay biplane with ailerons {{fitted to}} the top wing only. [...] A single {{horizontal}} stabiliser and elevator with twin balanced rudders mounted below it were carried on four wire-braced booms behind the wing. The crew and passengers were carried {{in a pair of}} flat-bottomed floats suspended on struts underneath the lower wing. [...] It was powered by three 50hp (37kW) Gnome Omega rotary engines arranged in line above the wing centre section, each connected by <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> to a long shaft at the rear of which was a four-bladed propeller 9ft 10in (3m) diameter. [...] To protect the occupants from the oil thrown out, the front engine was partially enclosed by an aluminium cowling.|$|E
2500|$|The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm (25×137mm) chain-fed autocannon. It is used {{extensively}} by the United States and NATO forces in ground combat vehicles and watercraft. Originally, the weapon {{was designed and}} manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. it is now produced by ATK at its Mesa, Arizona facility. It is an externally powered, chain driven, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic, burst, or automatic modes. It is fed by a metallic link belt and has dual-feed capability. The term [...] "chain gun" [...] derives {{from the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> that drives the bolt back and forth. The gun can destroy lightly armored vehicles and aerial targets, such as helicopters and slow-flying aircraft. It can also suppress enemy positions such as exposed troops, dug-in positions, and occupied built-up areas. The standard rate of fire is 200 rounds per minute. The weapon has an effective range of , {{depending on the type of}} ammunition used.|$|E

50|$|In bicycle chains, skip-link chain has {{the same}} one-inch spacing as the earlier block chain. Due to the asymmetry, the rollers fit over long teeth used with earlier block chain, but due {{to the use of}} rollers, {{efficiency}} is better than block chain. Skip-link chain is typically arranged with the long plates also the wide-spaced outer plates, which mimics the visual effect of block chain. Since sprocket teeth run on rollers, they cannot be usefully wider than the width of the narrow-spaced links, so the tooth can be no wider than with a symmetrical chain. Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than <b>a</b> symmetrical <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as <b>a</b> modern <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the pivoting pins and bushes, not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|E
50|$|Idler gears {{can also}} {{transmit}} rotation among distant shafts {{in situations where}} it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, but the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is quadratic in proportion to its radius. Instead of idler gears, of course, a toothed belt or <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending and the strength of the roller chain. A case where numerous idler gears might be used is as described above, where {{there are a number of}} output gears that need to be driven simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Outdoor {{mobile robot}} (OMR) was {{proposed}} for explosive detection capability with autonomous navigation on rough terrain. It is a four-wheel drive system with tracked configuration. The four separate drive units are constructed {{by means of}} a motor, bevel gears, sprocket-chain and wheels. The drive unit drives the ground wheel by means of <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> The whole load of the system is distributed on three ground wheels.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} include heavy duty rear shocks, heavy duty radiator with seven blade fan {{to keep it}} cool, deep groove pulleys, a high capacity oil pump, solid-lifter cam, and <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> timing <b>chain</b> to reduce stretch and provide more reliable performance. A transistorized duel points breaker distributor coupled with a Prestolite ignition and solid core wires was also used.|$|R

Camshafts act directly on bucket-type tappets. The intake camshaft is fitted with a continuously variable cam-phasing, altering timing up to 50 degrees. Valves are inclined at an included angle of 34 degrees versus the 4G15's wider 45 degrees.|$|R

The new 225ci engine (the 225-2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to; <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> timing <b>chain,</b> bi-metal connecting rod bearings, stellite-faced exhaust valves, roto caps on exhaust valves and polyacrylic valve stem seals.|$|R
50|$|Wippermann jr GmbH is <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> {{manufacturer}} {{located in}} Hagen, Germany, and founded by Wilfred Wippermann in 1893. They make the Connex brand of bicycle chains and master links. Their bicycle chains include such high-end features as nickel-plating, hollow pins, stainless steel, titanium rollers, and cutout plates. In 2008, Wippermann published wear test results {{in which their}} bicycle chains performed well. Wippermann chains are used by professional cyclists in the Tour de France.|$|E
50|$|Most often, {{the power}} is {{conveyed}} by <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with {{the teeth of the}} gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another type of drive chain is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth.|$|E
50|$|A {{master link}} or {{quick-release}} link is <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> accessory that allows convenient connection and disconnection {{of a chain}} {{without the need for}} a chain tool. It acts as a set of the chain's outer plates, so joining two sets of the chain's inner plate ends. Such master links {{may or may not be}} re-usable. A chain tool is nonetheless needed to adjust a chain's length, for example to shorten a new chain before connecting its ends. They are used on bicycles and motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|A bicycle {{chain is}} <b>a</b> form of <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> Bicycle chains {{may have a}} master link, or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus {{stronger}} chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a toothed belt or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine of}} the Mercedes 35 HP was {{at the front of}} the car driving the rear wheels through <b>a</b> large <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> The {{gearshift}} was at the driver's right side, featuring a gate change system with four forward speeds and a reverse gear. The drum like compact clutch system was attached to the flywheel. The flywheel consisted of a self-adjustable coil spring made up of wound spring steel. The tension at which the clutch operated was regulated by a conical cam.|$|R
50|$|The dual {{overhead}} camshafts {{are driven}} by <b>a</b> single-stage <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5°. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50°. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight.|$|R
50|$|A timing belt, {{timing chain}} or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the timing belt or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A timing belt is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} year, Kyrle Willans {{suggested}} that a worn-out conventional locomotive, a Manning-Wardle named Ancoats, could be rebuilt with the boiler and engine of a Sentinel steam waggon in the locomotive's frames, connected by <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> drive. This was the first steam locomotive, and the first example of the steam motor for railway use, to be constructed by Sentinel. Although Sentinel were to become known for gear-driven locomotives, other examples of this conversion of an older coupling rod locomotive continued to be produced; two examples survive, although derelict, at the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron.|$|E

50|$|Though Hans Renold is {{credited}} with inventing the <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> in 1880, sketches by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century show <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> with <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> bearing.|$|R
50|$|While {{some of the}} {{earliest}} self-lubricating bearings were developed by Chrysler {{the earliest}} self-lubricating chains were bushed chains, which consisted of pins, plates, and sintered bushes. The loss in strength of the bush required it to be made extra thick. This made the outer diameter so large that it did not allow enough room for <b>a</b> <b>roller.</b> These bushed <b>chains</b> suffer from the drawback of lower allowable load and tensile strength compared to regular <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> and the outer diameter of the bushes do not rotate when engaging a sprocket and may suffer faster wear and damage. While various chain manufacturers offered self-lubricating bushed chain designs based on sintered-bush technology since the 1950s, the world's first self-lubricating <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> was developed and launched by a Japanese chain manufacturer in 1988. After they made further improvements to the oil impregnation and sintering technologies, they received a patent for their lube-free <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> as evidenced by Patent #JP20070237969. In the new design, advancements in powder metal bush technology allowed engineers to design a bush that had a smaller diameter yet was stronger, which allowed room for rollers. These rollers improved performance by allowing the chain to articulate more smoothly into sprockets and protect the sintered bushes. Because of these advancements, the self-lubrication style chains achieved strength on par with regular <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> with the added benefit of being lube-free. Powdered metal sintered bearings (in the case of <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> the bushes) are self-lubricating because their porosity is impregnated with lubricants during the manufacturing process. In use, frictional heat causes the lubricant to expand and flow out of the pores, forming a film between mating parts. Low coefficients of friction, minimal maintenance and trouble-free service life, low cost, and simple installation are the chief advantages of powdered metal bearings.|$|R
50|$|The Roots type blower is a {{positive}} displacement lobe pump which operates by pumping a fluid {{with a pair of}} meshing lobes not unlike a set of stretched gears. Fluid is trapped in pockets surrounding the lobes and carried from the intake side to the exhaust. The most common application of the Roots type blower has been as the induction device on two-stroke Diesel engines, such as those produced by Detroit Diesel and Electro-Motive Diesel. Roots type blowers are also used to supercharge Otto cycle engines, with the blower being driven from the engine's crankshaft via a toothed or V-belt, <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> or a gear train.|$|E
50|$|In industry, it is usual {{to monitor}} the {{movement}} of the chain tensioner (whether manual or automatic) or the exact length of a drive chain (one rule of thumb is to replace <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> which has elongated 3% on an adjustable drive or 1.5% on a fixed-center drive). A simpler method, particularly suitable for the cycle or motorcycle user, is to attempt to pull the chain away from the larger of the two sprockets. Any significant movement (e.g. making it possible to see through a gap) probably indicates a chain worn up to and beyond the limit. Sprocket damage will result if the problem is ignored.|$|E

50|$|By 1916 Linn had {{developed}} an even smaller, more stable gasoline-powered half-track with an improved flexible traction system, independent of each other, {{with a central}} triangle-shaped rocker using two tear-dropped runner blocks suspended by axles, then surrounded by <b>an</b> independent <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> to disperse the load through these rollers, patented in 1918. The feature being with constant ground following traction, and steering accomplished by front wheels (or sled in winter); full power was supplied to both tracks {{all the time and}} transmitted to the ground so there was no loss of tractive effort when turning. Lombard and most other crawlers used a rigid bed inside the tracks which would be lifted off the ground at times, and track-steer crawlers reduce power through clutch or brake action to their tracks to turn, losing additional tractive effort. With its payload carrying ability, the Linn did not require trailers or wagons to move a load, something which off-road terrain does not always permit, and no dead weight or ballast was needed for traction, as simply more payload could be added.|$|R
50|$|Harold Dew {{left the}} company in February 1914 {{and set up a}} new concern at Charlotte Place, Clapham, London {{registered}} as D.U. Manufacturing Co making a car called the D'Ultra. This was available as either a two-seat car or delivery van and used a water-cooled Chater-Lea 8 hp 50-degree V-twin engine with 4-speed friction transmission. This transmission involved a prop-shaft to which was attached a friction disc driving a countershaft and thence by <b>a</b> single <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> to the cantilever sprung rear axle, which was not fitted with a differential. The front suspension was by a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring, and the steering was of the rack and pinion type. As was common with cycle cars the braking was only on the rear wheels, and while this was initially described as being both by internal expanding and contracting types operating on two drums the reality was rather different (see below). The ladder frame is described as being 'made of re-inforced ash, and is of quite simple design with only three cross-members'. Price was £115 complete with head lamps, hood, and wind screen.|$|R
5000|$|The Eldorado was radically {{redesigned}} in 1967 {{to capitalize}} on the era's burgeoning personal luxury car market. Promoted as a [...] "personal" [...] Cadillac, it shared the E-body with the second-generation Buick Riviera and the Oldsmobile Toronado, which had been introduced the previous year. To enhance its distinctiveness, Cadillac adopted the Toronado's front-wheel drive Unified Powerplant Package, adapted to a standard Cadillac 429 V8 coupled to a Turbo-Hydramatic 425 automatic transmission. Based on the Turbo-Hydramatic 400, the THM425 placed the torque converter next to the planetary gearbox, which it drove through <b>a</b> metal, motorcycle-style <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> Disc brakes were optional, and new standard safety equipment included an energy absorbing steering column and generously padded instrument panel. The Unified Powerplant Package was later shared with the GMC Motorhome starting in 1972.|$|R
