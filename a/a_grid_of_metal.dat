A symmetrical FPGA consists of a 2 -D arrayof logic blocks (LBs) surrounded by input-output blocks (IOBs) and <b>a</b> <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> prelaid <b>metal</b> segments that constitute the interconnects [1]. Switch matrices containing n-channel pass transistors (switches) electrically connect adjoining metal segments and connection matrices connect pins of LBs to a subset <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> interconnects [1]. Since the interco [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|An older, {{less common}} type of dropped ceiling is the {{concealed}} grid system. This type of dropped ceiling employs a method of interlocking panels into {{each other and the}} grid with the use of small strips <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> called 'splines', thus making it difficult to remove panels to gain access above the ceiling without damaging the installation or the panels. Normally, these type of ceilings will have a [...] "key panel" [...] (usually in the corner) which can be removed, allowing for the other panels to be slid out <b>of</b> the <b>grid</b> (<b>a</b> series <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> channels called 'z bars') one by one, until eventually removing the desired panel. This type of ceiling is more commonly found in older installations or installations where access to above the ceiling is generally considered unnecessary.|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} <b>a</b> comprehensive <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> 680 <b>metal</b> line-blanketed, NLTE, plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres for {{the basic}} parameters appropriate to O-type stars. The Ostar 2002 grid considers 12 values of effective temperatures, 27 500 K ≤ Teff ≤ 55 000 K with 2500 K steps, 8 surface gravities, 3. 0 ≤ log g ≤ 4. 75 with 0. 25 dex steps, and 10 chemical compositions, from metal-rich relative to the Sun to metal-free. The lower limit of log g for a given effective temperature is set by an approximate location of the Eddington limit. The selected chemical compositions have been chosen to cover a number of typical environments of massive stars: the galactic center, the Magellanic Clouds, Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies like IZw 18, and galaxies at high redshifts. The paper contains {{a description of the}} Ostar 2002 grid and some illustrative examples and comparisons. The complete Ostar 2002 grid is available at our website a...|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{the head}} {{will be made}} of steel and the handle of wood. Light weight {{titanium}} heads with longer handles allow for increased velocity, resulting in greater energy delivery, while decreasing arm fatigue and risk of carpal tunnel syndrome [...] The milled face of the head consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> waffle-like <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> small four sided pyramids. Nails typically used for framing have <b>a</b> <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> intersecting raised <b>metal</b> lines {{on the head of}} the nail. The raised marks on the head of the hammer grip this grid, which helps to prevent the hammer from sliding off the nail head when striking a nail. Since the frame typically will not be seen on the finished house, the inevitable marring of wood surfaces by the milled hammer face is not an issue. A hammer with a smooth striking surface is known as a finishing hammer and is used where marring of the wood is to be avoided for cosmetic reasons. Some framing hammers have a magnetized slot along the top edge of the striking surface to hold a nail. This allows the nail to be placed and driven quickly with just one hand.|$|R
40|$|B-modes in {{the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background (CMB) polarization is a smoking gun signature of the inflationary universe. To achieve better sensitivity to this faint signal, CMB polarization experiments aim to maximize the number of detector elements, resulting in a large focal plane receiver. Detector calibration of the polarization response becomes essential. It is extremely useful to be able to calibrate 'simultaneously' all detectors on the large focal plane. We developed a novel calibration system that rotates <b>a</b> large 'sparse' <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> wires, in front of and fully covering the field of view of the focal plane receiver. Polarized radiation is created via the reflection of ambient temperature from the wire surface. Since the detector has a finite beam size, the observed signal is smeared according to the beam property. The resulting smeared polarized radiation has a reasonable intensity (a few Kelvin or less) compared to the sky temperature ({approx} 10 K observing condition). The system played a successful role for receiver calibration of QUIET, a CMB polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. The successful performance revealed that this system is applicable to other experiments based on different technologies, e. g. TES bolometers...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} <b>a</b> comprehensive <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> 1540 <b>metal</b> line-blanketed, NLTE, plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres for {{the basic}} parameters appropriate to early B-type stars. The Bstar 2006 grid considers 16 values of effective temperatures, 15 000 K ≤ Teff ≤ 30 000 K with 1000 K steps, 13 surface gravities, 1. 75 ≤ log g ≤ 4. 75 with 0. 25 dex steps, 6 chemical compositions, and a microturbulent velocity of 2 kms − 1. The lower limit of log g for a given effective temperature is set by an approximate location of the Eddington limit. The selected chemical compositions range from twice to one tenth of the solar metallicity and metal-free. Additional model atmospheres for B supergiants (log g ≤ 3. 0) have been calculated with a higher microturbulent velocity (10 kms − 1) and a surface composition that is enriched in helium and nitrogen, and depleted in carbon. This new grid complements our earlier Ostar 2002 <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> O-type stars (Lanz & Hubeny, 2003, ApJS, 146, 417). The paper contains {{a description of the}} Bstar 2006 grid and some illustrative examples and comparisons. NLTE ionization fractions, bolometric corrections, radiative accelerations, and effective gravities are obtained over the parameter range covered by the grid. By extrapolating radiative accelerations, we have determined an improved estimate of the Eddington limit in absence of rotation between 55000 and 15000 K.
