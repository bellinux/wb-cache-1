500|$|Feeling {{discouraged}} by the idea nobody knows who he is, SpongeBob decides {{to start a new}} life as [...] "SpongeBob RoundPants", to which he decides to re-apply to his job at the Krusty Krab. When he meets Squidward at the restaurant, SpongeBob acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his first time applying at the Krusty Krab and has never met Squidward before. Squidward decides to take advantage of this by training SpongeBob to act like him, a horrible employee, in hopes SpongeBob will later get fired. After a series of complaints from the customers, Mr. Krabs confronts SpongeBob for his lousy work, to which SpongeBob explains since he has new pants, he is no longer [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants". Mr. Krabs then convinces SpongeBob he should take his pants off then. SpongeBob, no longer wearing pants, then continues to be his normal self and go back to being a good employee. When Sandy comes in seeing SpongeBob in his underwear, however, she (teasingly) calls him [...] "SpongeBob UnderPants", SpongeBob looks at his underwear and screams in horror, ending the episode.|$|E
500|$|Mahathir {{expressed}} {{discomfort with}} [...] "far too many non-Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays" [...] when [...] "...suddenly it has dawned upon the Malay that he cannot even call Malaya his land. There {{is no more}} Tanah Melayu — land of the Malays. He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not enough, he is being asked to give up {{more and more of}} his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment." [...] Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book.|$|E
500|$|Move {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} release, with many critics praising the album's overall sound. Andree Farias of Allmusic gave the album three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying [...] "After a number of career moves attempting to position themselves as {{the next big thing}} in rock, Third Day appear resigned to their place as one of the biggest rockers in Christian music: nothing more, nothing less. Move... reveals that much, as it finds the group embracing, hopefully definitively, that midpoint between spiritual fervor and Southern rock passion that suits them so well". Chris Carpenter of cbnmusic.com gave it four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining that [...] "The charismatic [...] Powell, along with guitarist Mark Lee, bassist Tai Anderson, and drummer David Carr, have crafted a project that is as musically stimulating as it is lyrically diverse... It's raw, passionate, and track after track is filled with uncompromising truth". Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave Move three out of five stars, noting an overall southern rock sound to the album and saying that it [...] "recalls 1999's treasured Time". C. E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "In the end, Move is a good album. It’s not a great album... Some will feel it’s a progression, but I really feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> more of the same from a band who has proven that they are capable of giving us more than the status quo". Andrew Greer of Christianity Today gave the album four out of five stars, praising it as [...] "Magically marrying deep soul with melodic rock throughout the entire twelve-track list" [...] and saying that it [...] "is yet another attractive release in an illustrious discography certain to be celebrated for years to come".|$|E

2500|$|Japp asks Poirot to {{join him}} at a house in Bardsley Garden Mews where a Mrs Barbara Allen shot herself the {{previous}} evening – Guy Fawkes Night – the moment of death being disguised by the noise of fireworks. Once there they find that the doctor thinks there is something strange {{about the death of}} the fine lady, a young widow. Mrs Allen was found by a housemate, Miss Jane Plenderleith, who had been away in the country the previous night. The victim was locked in her room and was shot through the head with an automatic, the weapon being found in her hand. [...] The doctor however points out that the gun is in her right hand while the wound is above the left ear – an impossible position to shoot with the right hand. It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a murder made to look like suicide – and by an unusually incompetent murderer with a very low estimation of the intelligence of police investigators. [...] They interview Miss Plenderleith and find out that Mrs Allen was engaged to be married to Charles Laverton-West, an up-and-coming young MP but, although the pistol was the dead lady's, she cannot think of a reason why she should use it to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|John's gospel is {{the only}} {{canonical}} one that gives Thomas the Apostle a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas {{is the only}} character therein described as having apistos (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters {{to live up to}} the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of [...] "Doubting Thomas", it is suggested that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a sine qua non of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced. For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the [...] "Doubting Thomas" [...] story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock [...] "comeback" [...] to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts about the spirit and body are really not so different from those which John has presented elsewhere. John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and hands into his body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying one-upmanship by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that [...] "...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...". The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.|$|E

5000|$|The 2014 {{football}} season had mixed results. While the Varsity team had a measly record of 3-8, the JV (Junior Varsity) squad {{had a different}} story to tell.

50|$|Largely {{thanks to}} the {{innovative}} strategies developed by Renee Baillargeon and her colleagues, considerable knowledge has been gained in the about how young infants come to understand natural physical laws. Much of this research depends on carefully observing when infants react as if events are unexpected. For example, if an infant sees an object {{that appears to be}} suspended in mid-air, and behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> unexpected, then this suggests that the infant has an understanding that things usually fall if they are not supported. Baillargeon and her colleagues have contributed evidence, for example, about infants’ understanding of object permanence and their reasoning about hidden objects.|$|E
50|$|Z213: Exit obliterates genre {{boundaries}} and is simultaneously a novella, a poem and a journal. In contradistinction to “factual report” works such <b>as</b> <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a man by}} Primo Levi, the work adopts a mode of oneiric realism whereby horror is forced {{beneath the surface of}} consciousness only to emerge again in new and increasingly nightmarish forms. Oblique references to tragedies of recent human history are apparent, although, ample Biblical and mythical motives suggest a far broader project. The book can be read as the first volume of a postmodern epic. It is considered {{as one of the most}} important anti-utopian works of the 21st century.|$|E
