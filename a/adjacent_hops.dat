40|$|Large-scale {{propagation}} effect {{plays an}} important role in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems. In particular, the position of the relay (between the source and destination) determines the path-loss effects of <b>adjacent</b> <b>hops,</b> which will further affect the performance of each hop and thus the relay system. In this paper, by minimizing the outage probability of a decode-and-forward (DF) MIMO relay system with orthogonal space-time block coding, we show that relay position optimization improves the finite-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) diversity gain of a relay system whose <b>adjacent</b> <b>hops</b> have different diversity orders (unbalanced system). Specifically, with relay position optimization, the diversity gain is no longer bounded by that of the weaker hop, i. e., the hop with a lower diversity order, but approaches the diversity order of the stronger hop. This diversity improvement provides a dramatic improvement for the end-to-end outage probability. It will also be shown that although power allocation has no effects on the achievable diversity order, it provides some SNR gains...|$|E

In order to mitigate arbitrariness and increase consistency, we propose to improve the semantic relatedness of concepts mentioned in a story by increasing the relevance of links between nodes through additional domain delineation and refinement steps. On top of this, we propose the implementation of an optimized algorithm controlling the pathfinding process to obtain more homogeneous search domain and retrieve more links between <b>adjacent</b> <b>hops</b> in each path. Preliminary results indicate the potential of the proposal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} spectrally efficient {{differential frequency}} hopping (DFH) system design. Relying on time-frequency diversity over large spectrum and high speed frequency hopping, DFH systems are robust against hostile jamming interference. However, the spectral efficiency of conventional DFH systems {{is very low}} due to only using the frequency of each channel. To improve the system capacity, in this paper, we propose an innovative high order differential frequency hopping (HODFH) scheme. Unlike in traditional DFH where the message is carried by the frequency relationship between the <b>adjacent</b> <b>hops</b> using one order differential coding, in HODFH, the message is carried by the frequency and phase relationship using two-order or higher order differential coding. As a result, system efficiency is increased significantly since the additional information transmission is achieved by the higher order differential coding {{at no extra cost}} on either bandwidth or power. Quantitative performance analysis on the proposed scheme demonstrates that transmission through the frequency and phase relationship using two-order or higher order differential coding essentially introduces another dimension to the signal space, and the corresponding coding gain can increase the system efficiency...|$|E

5000|$|The key design {{concepts}} of TORA is localization of control messages {{to a very}} small set of nodes near the occurrence of a topological change. To accomplish this, nodes need to maintain the routing information about <b>adjacent</b> (one <b>hop)</b> nodes. The protocol performs three basic functions: ...|$|R
30|$|With this PRR information, {{we examine}} the {{connectivity}} between <b>adjacent</b> <b>hop</b> levels and the communication overhead distribution among nodes. Without respect to a target node, any other node that has a PRR for bidirectional links higher than the link threshold is called its neighboring node. In other words, every pair of neighboring nodes can directly {{communicate with each other}} if the successful packet transmission and reception rates are above the link threshold. Communication to all the other nodes may require multihop forwarding through neighboring nodes. The link threshold can be adjusted, which will change the hop level of nodes from the sink. The use of this threshold makes routing more reliable. As the link threshold increases, a constructed tree with more hop levels can provide higher throughput due to higher successful transmission rate of the link than a simple minimum hop count routing.|$|R

Driven therefore, we tend to promote the completely uneven straightforward exclusion method (TASEP), a particle flow model in natural philosophy, as a helpful analytical tool to check unintended networks with random access. Using the TASEP framework, we tend to initial investigate the typical end-to-end delay and turnout performance of a linear multi-hop flow of packets. To boot, we tend to analytically derive the distribution of delays incurred by packets at every node, further because the joint distributions of the delays across <b>adjacent</b> <b>hops</b> on the flow. We tend to then think about additional advanced wireless network models comprising across flows, and propose the partial mean-field approximation (PMFA), a technique that helps tightly approximate the turnout performance of the system. We tend to finally demonstrate via a straightforward example that the PMFA procedure is sort of general therein it's going to be wont to accurately judge {{the performance}} of unintended network topologies.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2 (a), the lowest ETX parent {{selection}} without hop count consideration results in longer hop levels. The longest hop level is 7. Since each node uses the lowest ETX parent selection, {{the distance between}} the parent and the children nodes tends to be close and the number of hop levels increases. All possible direct links between <b>adjacent</b> <b>hop</b> level nodes by the random parent selection scheme with MHR are presented in Figure 2 (b). Each node randomly selects one among nodes that are connected with a direct link as its parent node. As the distance from the sink increases, the first-hop nodes have more direct links to the second-hop level nodes. With the link threshold 0.9, the MHR scheme significantly reduces the hop count as compared with the lowest ETX scheme in Figure 2 (a). Figure 2 (c) shows the connectivity graph of the lowest ETX parent selection with MHR. Since each node selects the lowest ETX neighboring nodes in the upper hop level, the selected parent nodes tend to be located {{at the edge of the}} hop level, closer to the second-hop level nodes. For the balanced scheme shown in Figure 2 (d), data forwarding paths to the sink are almost evenly spread among the first-hop level nodes.|$|R

This state possesses a local circular current and possibly causes the pseudogap phase in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. We introduce into the trial function a configuration dependent phase factor, which was recently {{shown to be}} indispensable to stabilize current-carrying states. We {{pay attention to the}} energy gain as a function of <b>adjacent</b> O-O <b>hopping</b> and Cu-site coulomb repulsion U. It is found the SF state becomes stable for hole doping rates of and, owing to the reduction in kinetic energy, but seems fragile because the energy gain rapidly decays on doping holes for any.

We show that at the first order in the ratio of hopping and interaction amplitudes, the array maps in an effective two level system with energy separation becoming exponentially small in the macroscopic (large N) limit. Decoherence at zero temperature is studied {{in the limit of}} weak coupling with phonons. In this case the macroscopic limit is robust with respect to decoherence. Some possible applications in quantum information processing are discussed. Comment: Phys. Rev. A (in press...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a {{preventive}} scheme using directional antennas to improve the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. In this dissertation, a novel Directionality based Preventive Link Maintenance (DPLM) Scheme is proposed to characterize the performance gain [JaY 06 a, JaY 06 b, JCY 06] by extending the life of link. In order to maintain the link and take preventive action, signal strength of data packets is measured. Moreover, location information or angle of arrival information is collected during communication and saved in the table. When measured signal strength is below orientation threshold, an orientation warning is generated towards the previous hop node. Once orientation warning is received by previous <b>hop</b> (<b>adjacent)</b> node, it verifies the correctness of orientation warning with few hello pings and initiates high quality directional link (a link above the threshold) and immediately switches to it, avoiding a link break altogether. The location information is utilized to create a directional link by orienting neighboring nodes antennas towards each other. We call this operation an orientation handoff, which is similar to soft-handoff in cellular networks. ^ Signal strength is the indicating factor, which represents the health of the link and helps to predict the link failure. In other words, link breakage happens due to node movement and subsequently reducing signal strength of receiving packets. DPLM scheme helps ad hoc networks to avoid or postpone costly operation of route rediscovery in on-demand routing protocols by taking above-mentioned preventive action. ^ This dissertation advocates close but simple collaboration between the routing, medium access control and physical layers. In order to extend the link, the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocols were modified to use the ability of directional antennas to transmit over longer distance. A directional antenna module is implemented in OPNET simulator with two separate modes of operations: omnidirectional and directional. The antenna module has been incorporated in wireless node model and simulations are performed to characterize the performance improvement of mobile ad hoc networks. Extensive simulations have shown that without affecting the behavior of the routing protocol noticeably, aggregate throughput, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay (latency), routing overhead, number of data packets dropped, and number of path breaks are improved considerably. We have done the analysis of the results in different scenarios to evaluate that the use of directional antennas with proposed DPLM scheme has been found promising to improve the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. ...|$|R
