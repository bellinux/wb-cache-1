25|$|The {{court can}} impose a {{condition}} that a defendant not consume alcohol. Courts can prohibit use of other legally-obtained intoxicants as well.

The court can order outpatient drug <b>abuse</b> <b>treatment</b> and alcohol testing even if the defendant has no history of drug or alcohol abuse, if the defendant has attempted suicide by overdosing on medication and {{has a history of}} unstable behavior. The court may waive the statutory drug testing requirement if the presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse, but in some circuits is not required to do so although at least one defendant was not required to under mandatory drug testing as part of his probation where the offense was not drug-related and the defendant did not have a history of drug abuse.

500|$|There {{is a risk}} of misuse and {{dependence}} in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam's high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential.

Despite this, most prescribed alprazolam users do not use their medication recreationally, and the long-term use of benzodiazepines does not generally correlate {{with the need for}} dose escalation.
