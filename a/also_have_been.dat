5|$|Explosives would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> superfluous. At its closing {{velocity}} of 10.2km/s, the impactor's kinetic energy was equivalent to 4.8 {{metric tons of}} TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 370kg.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament {{had forced}} England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; he may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} decades Hines drifted between jobs and countries, including spending {{three years in}} the King's Liverpool Regiment and serving as a guide in the Second Boer War, before arriving in Australia in mid-1914. He was a large man and much of his body was covered in tattoos. Hines may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> illiterate, though he was capable of signing his name.|$|E
5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{found in}} the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur {{appears to have been}} scavenged by a shark).|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters. It may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> that the building was saved by its proximity to Grüneburgpark with its prisoner of war camp holding captured American airmen.|$|E

5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, {{they may have had}} a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively {{suggest that this}} reduction in solar radiation at the surface {{may have led to}} the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{have been}} known to breed with tigers (most often the Siberian and Bengal tigers) to create hybrids called ligers and tiglons (or tigons). They <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crossed with leopards to produce leopons. Such hybrid {{breeding}} is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.|$|E

5|$|Married {{women were}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day running of the household. At marriage, they assumed responsibility for the prosperity of their husband's household and the health of its members. Their primary responsibilities were bearing, raising and caring for children, weaving cloth and making clothes. They would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible for caring for ill household members, supervising slaves, and ensuring that the household had sufficient food.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6 was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} manned Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used {{in the event of}} an emergency evacuation.

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in {{water in the}} Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably more common than potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter. Lithium and rubidium <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed in the watershed, with concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 and 0.04 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} Iowans {{activities}} {{over the next}} two years are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{hills in}} the {{locality}} such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. Solsbury Hill overlooking the current city was an Iron Age hill fort, and the adjacent Bathampton Camp may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> one. A long barrow site {{believed to be}} from the Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
