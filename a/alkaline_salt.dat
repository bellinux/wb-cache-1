5000|$|Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, an <b>alkaline</b> <b>salt,</b> is {{produced}} in two forms. One is a clear, liquid concentrate, which can be mistaken for corn syrup if repackaged and not properly labeled or it is packaged as a white, odorless, powdered chemical substance that is not flammable, combustible, or explosive and has low acute oral and dermal toxicity. This salt, which is commonly confused with boric acid, is used as an insecticide and is commonly sold in liquid or powder form. It is also effective against fungi and algae. It has an infinite shelf life and is not affected by temperature. [...] "Bora-Care" [...] is the liquid form suitable {{for use in a}} sprayer. The powdered brands are [...] "Tim-Bor," [...] "Borathor," [...] "Termite Prufe" [...] or [...] "Board Defense" [...] as sold in the United States, and as [...] "Can-Bor" [...] in Canada. This chemical is also a flame-retardant. [...] In the liquid form, it is commonly diluted and sprayed on wood surfaces to kill termites, powder post beetles, carpenter ants, fungi and algae.

50|$|Salt {{is added}} when making the flour dough to {{strengthen}} gluten structures {{and enhance the}} sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is {{to slow down the}} activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures, and microbial growth. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>salt,</b> such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because flavonoid pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese ramen, this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.|$|E

5000|$|Native Americans {{had been}} using ground corn (maize) for food {{thousands}} of years before European explorers arrived in the New World.European settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread {{has been called a}} [...] "cornerstone" [...] of the Cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A coarser meal (compare flour) made from corn is grits.

These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy.

Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean chicha).

30|$|Alkaline {{reagents}} are preferred, {{especially by}} Cantonese people, for making alkaline noodles [32].

The quantity of sodium hydroxide is usually 0.3 – 1.0 % for the partially boiled alkaline noodles. Alkaline–flour interactions are responsible for several effects, including strengthening of the dough texture [44]; reducing the dough development time and dough stability; improvement in both the firmness and chewiness of noodles [45]; retardation of starch gelatinization and increase in starch paste viscosity [44, 46]; inhibition of enzyme activity and enzymatic browning [43, 47]; and also contribution to the bright yellow color, aroma and flavor [47].|$|R
