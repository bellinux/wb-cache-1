5|$|In 1997, {{suppressed}} P90s {{were used}} in combat by the Peruvian special forces group (Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales) in Operation Chavín de Huantar, the hostage rescue siege that ended the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. The operation was a success: all 14 MRTA revolutionaries were killed, and 71 hostages were rescued. The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the hostages were equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces' P90s. In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{languages}} {{existed in the}} multi-ethnic Empire, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were given limited official status in their provinces at various times. Notably, {{by the beginning of}} the Middle Ages, Syriac had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces. Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces, and later foreign contacts made Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.|$|E

5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E
5|$|No {{music that}} can be {{definitively}} traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some of {{it may have been}} used in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters.

5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> fragments may end up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation {{is probably the most}} frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{resettlement}} involved the dispersal of the new arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities. The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled, notably Biên Hòa, where the population had doubled during the migration period. In contrast, two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10,000 refugees, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> less than 1,000. In the crowded provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a shortage of work.|$|E
5|$|All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface {{pressures}} {{in the range}} 0.01–1nbar, which in turn support substantial ionospheres with electron densities {{in the range of}} 1,000–10,000cm−3. The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings. The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non-magnetized planets like Venus, although the co-rotational speed is usually subsonic (the speeds vary from 74 to 328km/s), which prevents the formation of a bow shock. The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent. In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).|$|E

5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as}} a basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|Having had two frigates {{confirm that}} the French fleet was still at Brest, and {{realising}} that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone. On the same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements. At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail {{in an attempt to}} reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing to reduce his numbers by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.|$|E

The following year, Stan Jones won the Knute Rockne Award. In 1955, the Touchdown Club bestowed its Walter Camp Memorial Trophy, for best player, and Knute Rockne Award, for best lineman, upon center Bob Pellegrini, who was also named the Lineman of the Year by United Press International (UPI). In 1974, Randy White won the Lombardi Award, for best lineman or linebacker; the Outland Trophy, for best interior lineman; and was named the UPI Lineman of the Year. In 2002, E. J.
