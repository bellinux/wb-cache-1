The situation {{inside the building}} was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 {{were reported to have}} died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E

25|$|The danza {{remained}} vital {{until the}} 1920s, {{but after that}} decade its appeal came {{to be limited to}} the Hispanophilic elite. The danzas of Morel Campos, Tavárez, José Quintón, and a few others are still performed and heard on various occasions, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> recent composers have penned their own idiosyncratic forms of danzas, but the genre is no longer a popular social dance idiom.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the leather}} {{industry}} has declined, some local companies have survived by developing leather products suited to niche markets. The remaining businesses concentrate {{on one or}} two types of leather. They remain ready to adapt to changes in trends.

Another handful of state-of-the-art leather finishing facilities can be found there, as well as a dozen or so leather dealers.|$|E

25|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, military ranks were frequently changed by the tsar during efforts to reform the army and create a strong Navy. These many changes were routinely documented into Army's Rules of engagement since 1716, until they were finally incorporated into the first variant of Table of Ranks in 1722. Comparing to Strelets Troops, a few more non-commissioned ranks were added, the soldier rank was replaced with many speciality ranks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> General ranks were added. The naval ranks were created from scratch, ranks for the naval infantry and engineers would only come in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Electronic sirens {{incorporate}} circuits such as oscillators, modulators, and amplifiers {{to synthesize}} a selected siren tone (wail, yelp, pierce/priority/phaser, hi-lo, scan, airhorn, manual, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more)</b> which is played through external speakers. It is not unusual, {{especially in the}} case of modern fire engines, to see an emergency vehicle equipped with both types of sirens. Often, police sirens also use the interval of a tritone to help draw attention. The first electronic siren that mimicked the sound of a mechanical siren was invented in 1965 by Motorola employees Ronald H. Chapman and Charles W. Stephens.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, the Army {{ordered a}} new DH-4 variant from Boeing, {{distinguished}} by a fuselage of fabric-covered steel tube {{in place of}} the original plywood structure. These three prototypes were designated DH-4M-1 (M for modernized) and were ordered into production alongside the generally similar DH-4M-2 developed by Atlantic Aircraft. A total of 22 of the 163 DH-4M-1s were converted by the Army into dual-control trainers (DH-4M-1T) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> into target tugs (DH-4M-1K). Thirty of the aircraft ordered by the Army were diverted to the Navy for Marine Corps use, these designated O2B-1 for the base model, and O2B-2 for aircraft equipped for night and cross-country flying.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{district}} {{had been almost}} built out by 1890, the architectural movements of the early 20th century made little impact on it. An American Foursquare was built at {{the southwest corner of}} Clinton and Lexington in 1905, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> stone and brick rowhouses were built on North Pearl in that decade. Most buildings in early 20th century styles were public ones, like the Classical Revival police station built at 222 Pearl Street in 1911. The 1931 opening of the Palace Theatre at Clinton and North Pearl, where its history began, gave {{the district}} its newest contributing property and ended its period of significance.|$|E
25|$|In its May 1971 issue, Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{published a}} comparison road test {{that included a}} Caprice Coupe and a Cadillac Sedan de Ville. The tested Caprice was powered by the 454 V8 and loaded with virtually all available options. Though testers noted that the Cadillac had {{a higher level of}} quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was upholstered in leather while the Caprice had the standard cloth trim), the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac's $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest quality addition <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> luxury features.|$|E

25|$|Many classic {{adventure}} games cannot run {{on modern}} operating systems. Early adventure games were developed for home computers {{that are not}} in use today. Emulators are available for modern computers that allow these old games to be played on the latest operating systems. One open-source software project called ScummVM provides a free engine for the LucasArts adventure games, the SCUMM-derived engine for Humongous Entertainment adventure games, early Sierra titles, Revolution Software 2D adventures, Coktel Vision adventure games <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> assorted 2D adventures. ResidualVM is a sister project to ScummVM, aimed to emulate 3D-based adventure games such as Grim Fandango and Myst III: Exile. Another called VDMSound can emulate the old sound-cards which many of the games require.|$|E
25|$|Tractado del dormir et despertar et del soñar et de las adevinanças et agüeros et profeçía ("Treatise on {{sleeping}} and waking; of dreaming and of divinations; of presages and prophecies"): Consists of six treatises created {{at the behest}} of John II, following his satisfaction with the Tratado de caso e fortuna, and displays a similar orthodox form. It attempts to distinguish divinely inspired dreams concerning biblical scripture and biblical figures such as Joseph, from dreams that are nothing more than dreams. It also explores the Christian theory of the prophet and the omens and riddles presented in the Bible. The British Museum of London has a number of well-preserved copies. There is one hand-written copy dating from 1559 held by the National Library of Madrid <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> in the University of Salamanca library dating from the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|However {{the project}} quickly proved a success, {{and the area}} soon boasted more shoppers, cafes, and a renewed street life. Building on Strøget’s success, the network {{expanded}} piecemeal – another street <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> squares were emptied of cars in 1968, and further closures took place in 1973, and 1992. From the initial 15,800 square metres of the Strøget, Copenhagen’s central pedestrian network has expanded to about 100,000 square metres. In 1993 Amagertorv (Amager square) was re-surfaced in a pattern made of granite, designed by artist Bjørn Nørgaard. Nearby areas were also pedestrianised over the years, for example Nyhavn in 1980 and the town hall square (semi-pedestrianised) in 1996 {{on the occasion of}} Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture (the through road was removed although bus traffic remained, and the square is still bounded by traffic).|$|E

25|$|The {{new season}} started with Delio Rossi still {{in charge of}} the club: Simon Kjær and Edinson Cavani left the club, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> {{promising}} youngsters were signed (most notably Argentine Ezequiel Muñoz and the Slovene duo of Armin Bačinović and Josip Iličić), plus more experienced acquisitions such as forwards Massimo Maccarone and Mauricio Pinilla. The 2010–11 season also marked Palermo's return into continental football {{in the form of the}} UEFA Europa League. Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4–3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3–1 to Internazionale in the final. For the 2011–12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round. In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under-19 team coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the Rosanero in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti. Palermo arrived 16th in that season.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the United States Army became involved. On November 13, General David E. Twiggs ordered Major Samuel P. Heintzelman to lead an {{expedition}} of several hundred men to Brownsville. Though the major would be starting out from Old Camp Verde, in central Texas, many of the units placed under his command would be coming from distant states or territories, such as Kansas and Virginia. Because of this, Heinztelman issued orders {{for the majority of}} his men to rendezvous with him at Fort Merrill, on the Nueces River, and the remainder to assemble at Fort McIntosh, in Laredo, before beginning the final march to Brownsville. The major left Camp Verde on November 14 and arrived in Brownsville just before midnight on December 6, a journey of 332 miles. At that time, Heintzelman had with him two batteries from the 1st Artillery, under Lieutenants Douglas Ramsay and William Montrose Graham, Jr., a company from the 2nd Cavalry, under Captain George Stoneman, and two companies from the 8th Infantry, under Captains Arthur Tracy Lee and Charles Downer Jordan. Another battery of artillery, one company of cavalry, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> companies of infantry was still at Laredo. During all this time, Cortina's army grew to at least 400 men and a few artillery pieces but they were not well armed individually and had little or no military training. With information collected by Mayor Stephen Powers, District Judge Edmund J. Davis, and the filibuster José María Jesús Carbajal in Matamoros, Heintzelman concluded that Cortina probably had no more than 300 to 350 men, only 100 of whom were mounted. The Texas Rangers insisted that the number was at least 600.|$|E
