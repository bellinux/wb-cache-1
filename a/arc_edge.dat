40|$|The article {{concerns}} the automatic calibration {{of a camera}} with radial distortion from a single image. It is known that, under the mild assumption of square pixels and zero skew, lines in the scene project into circles in the image, and three lines suffice to calibrate the camera up to an ambiguity between focal length and radial distortion.

To facilitate this study, a lattice Boltzmann method based numerical framework is established, in which the multi-block scheme and the overlap-mesh approach with improved information exchange mechanisms are used to balance the computational accuracy and efficiency, and the interpolated bounce-back scheme and a corrected momentum exchange scheme are adopted for accurate force evaluation. Two configurations are considered. In the first configuration, the cylinder is fixed, on which a pair of SJs is implemented and operates in phase. Effects of the SJ pair on the cylinder wake are investigated in a systematical way, with the focus placed on the SJ's momentum coefficient, frequency and position. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} Kármán vortex street formed behind the cylinder can be effectively suppressed when the SJ pair operates with sufficiently high momentum coefficient, at a frequency close to the cylinder's natural vortex shedding frequency, and is placed in the quarter <b>arc</b> <b>edge</b> of the cylinder's leeward side. In the second configuration, the same cylinder is allowed to oscillate in the cross-flow direction under the excitation of asymmetrically shedding vortices as well as the constraint of a spring. It is well demonstrated that this one-dimensional VIV of the cylinder can be successfully suppressed by the use of SJ control. Due to stronger vortex shedding induced by increased relative motion between the cylinder and its surrounding flow, however, not all the cases that perform complete wake suppression on the fixed cylinder are able to completely suppress the VIVs of the oscillating cylinder. Through the present study, details about SJ-controlled flow around the cylinder and in the wake are also revealed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Turbulence {{enhanced}} {{momentum and}} energy transport {{is an important}} mechanism in shaping the flow and temperature field of low current turbulent SF 6 (Sulfur-hexafluoride) arcs burning in a nozzle. It is a factor that largely determines the prediction accuracy of the interruption capability of high voltage circuit breakers. Previous study [81] has shown that for SF 6 arcs the parameters in the Prandtl mixing length model and the two equation k-ε model must be adjusted to bring agreement between prediction and measurement. The experimental observation [109] of steep temperature or density gradient exists at the <b>arc</b> <b>edge,</b> where turbulence is usually strongest. The density gradient {{can be regarded as}} a result of temperature gradient when the pressure difference across the low current arc column is small. In previous studies of turbulence models, the effects of large density or temperature gradient have not been considered. In the present work the k-ε model is modified {{to take into account the}} effect of the presence of steep local temperature gradient. The model is first applied to the steady state SF 6 nozzle arcs in the current range from 100 A to 1800 A. The performance of the modified turbulence model is assessed by a comparison of the predicted and measured radial temperature profiles at different currents and its behaviours with another two most commonly used turbulence models, the Prandtl mixing length model and the k-ε model. The relevant turbulence parameters of the Prandtl mixing length model are adjusted according to the different nozzle shapes with different values and it has been found that its applicability is limited. The modified k-ε model, which is modified to take into account the effect of large temperature gradient with all default coefficients, can make reasonable prediction for turbulent arcs in the Aachen nozzle [67, 108] under direct current conditions. The model is then applied to the transient nozzle arcs in a GE nozzle [86] and the Campbell nozzle [85]. Finally, a real puffer-type circuit breaker of 252 kV has been used to verify this model. The predicted arc voltage and pressure agree reasonably well with the measurements at both high and low current levels, justifying the applicability of the modified k-ε turbulence model. The auto-expansion circuit breaker is a relatively new interruption technique, which creates the required fast gas flow at current zero using the energy dissipated by the arc itself. A design study has been carried out for a prototype 245 kV auto-expansion circuit breaker at 50 Hz, in order to investigate the influence of key design parameters in terms of arcing conditions at the current zero phase and the critical RRRV (Rate of Rise of Recovery Voltage). Auxiliary nozzle with different lengths, and the severity of leakage from the expansion volume have been implemented for testing the influence of design parameters in an auto-expansion circuit breaker. PC-based arc modelling taking account the effect of nozzle ablation and the mixing process of PTFE vapour with SF 6 has been made for auxiliary nozzle investigation. For the effect of leakage, various sizes of a leakage hole are specified on the valve of the expansion volume. The critical RRRV values for the Ref. Case and the its modifications are used for comparison of its interruption capability in order to estimate the influence of these key design parameters. The solution of all of the equations in the arc models is based on a commercial computational fluid dynamics package, PHOENICS. PHOENICS has been extensively used at the University of Liverpool to model the arc behaviours since 1992. Before using PHOENICS to simulate the arc behaviour in this thesis some conditions need to be resolved. These are related with the choice of turbulence model, the computational domain size for electric field, and the influence of the Lorentz force. The differential models for reported works in the thesis is implemented into PHOENICS version 3. 6. 1. All boundary conditions which are treated as sources terms are discussed in Section 2. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{concerned}} with the development of computational models for two types of atmospheric technological plasmas with background applications in material processing (waste disposal and production of nano-scale powders) and formation of nano-scale carbon structures (formation of carbon nano-tubes and fullerenes).. The twin torch system consists of two electrode assemblies, each of which has a central electrode surrounded by a nozzle to confine the shielding gas. The two electrodes are configured to have an angle between their axes. The arcing environment is truly three dimensional (3 D) and thus requires a three dimensional model to simulate the arcing process. Representation of 3 D shape in the computational domain is a challenging issue and needs to be addressed before a sensible solution is obtained. In the present model a novel numerical scheme is developed to conveniently and automatically allocate cells (each cell is a finite volume in the solution procedure) to a 3 D shape. This has greatly enhanced the adaptability of the model to cope with complex geometries encountered in arc plasma systems. One of the key issues in 3 D arc modelling is the correct calculation and application of the Lorentz force terms in the momentum equation. For a symmetric arcing case, such as a free burning arc between a conic cathode and a plate anode, slight asymmetry in the distribution of Lorentz force can substantially affect the arc flow hence resulting in a non-symmetric arc column. Validation of the numerical method has been carried out using the free burning arc case by comparing the model predictions with measurements and other available simulation results. It has been shown that the present 3 D model produces satisfactory results. Since the two electrodes of the twin plasma system are water cooled, erosion of the electrode material is minimal and can be neglected. It has been found that the coupling of the two jets is through a thin, tissue like, conducting layer between the two jets. The cross sectional shape of the two jets is deformed by the Lorentz force. The jets are never completely merged. The Lorentz force induced by the arc current and the combined magnetic field of the two jets tends to move the point of separation away from the electrode tips. It is the strong Ohmic heating, resulting from the high temperature (high electrical conductivity) and high electric field in the coupling zone, that heats up the incoming cold gas to a conducting temperature and thus stabilises the electric current path and subsequently the point of separation of the two jets. It is also shown that the change in flow rate does not have significant influence on the parameters of the plasma. The predicted arc voltage is found to be higher than the measurement. The difference is partly attributed to the statistically high frequency fluctuation of the jet coupling zone. The use of a simple turbulence model brings the prediction closer to the measurement at low current, however results in an excessive reduction in arc voltage at high current. Therefore the use of a conventional turbulence model with a fixed turbulence parameter c to simulate the effect of fluctuations of the jet coupling zone may not be appropriate. The carbon arc simulated in Chapter S is confined by liquid water and bums in the gap between a conic anode and a plate cathode. Such an arrangement aims at maximising the anode erosion rate for the formation of solid carbon Ã‚Â·structures (carbon nanotubes and fullerenes). A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the dynamics of bubble growth and development of the ~c column. A novel numerical scheme is employed to detennine the speed of bubble surface expansion. To simulate the removal of gas from within the domain associated with bubble detachment from the discharge zone, an exit is imposed on the bubble surface when its radius reaches 9 mm. Results show that there is large pressure change within the first half millisecond of the discharge. The pressure can be as high as 38 bar. Under such a high pressure the water surrounding the bubble is accelerated which leads to an increasing speed of bubble growth. The rapid growth of bubble size under its inertia caused the pressure inside the bubble to rapidly decrease. The arc voltage, which is an indication of the total electrical power input into the domain, settles down in the first millisecond and then maintains a value of SV. The arc temperature at initiation is 24000 K within a thin hot column~ This temperature is quickly reduced to l 1000 K in SJ. lS as a result of radiation loss from the arc column. The axis temperature inside the arc column at 30 ms is 8 S 00 K which is higher than the experimental value measured using a spectroscopic method. The possible reason for this difference could be the instability of the arc column which makes the measured temperature as an average value of the arc column. There exists a relatively large area around the arc core whose temperature is within the range of 4 S 00 K to 7000 K which is the temperature range from measurement. A quasi-steady state of arcing is reached within 30 ms of arc initiation. The loss of carbon vapour from the computational domain resulting from formation of solid carbon matters is considered by a flux controlled model. Results show that the major loss of the carbon species is at the <b>arc</b> <b>edge</b> which accounts for 99 % of the total carbon loss. The predicted arc column voltage is SV which is different from the measurement of 16 V. The difference is contributed to the cathode voltage fall which is in the order of the ionisation energy of carbon atoms (11. 26 eV). Taking this aspect into consideration, the prediction falls into the expected range. The biggest difference between the prediction and measurement is the water evaporation rate. The arc model prediction is only a very small fraction of the measurement. However, it is shown that the measured rate of water evaporation may be incorrect since even when the total electrical power input at the measured arc voltage is used, the amount of water vapour that can be created is only 12. 5 % of the measured value. This renders the water evaporation rate comparison invalid and further measurements are required. Future work is discussed {{at the end of the}} thesis. Three aspects have been identified that need to be addressed. The instability of the twin torch jet coupling may need to be simulated by a transient model. The cathode sheath is important in determining the whole arc voltage and therefore needs to be simulated using kinetic theory. The effectiveness of three dimensional modelling suffers enormously from the prohibitively long computing time because of the strong reiaxation that has to be used to obtain converging results. This naturally requires parallel processing given that high processing power PCs (2. lGHz Pentium Core Duo) have already been used for the present work.
