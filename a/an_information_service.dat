Ian was {{diagnosed}} with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) when he was five-years old. As a result, Vanbiesbrouck started the Vanbiesbrouck Foundation for children with Attention Deficit Disorder to increase awareness of and raise money for children with ADD. However, when he left Florida via free agency the foundation was dissolved and {{the mission of the}} program went into <b>an</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> based in South Florida.

25|$|In July 2013, Uber started {{services}} in Taiwan. However, {{as the company}} registered as <b>an</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> firm, {{it did not have}} any permission to operate transportation services. This led to protests from taxi drivers and fines in millions of dollars from the government. Refusing to pay the penalties, Uber was banned in February 2017. In April 2017, the company resumed services after constructive talks with authorities and partnered with licensed car rental companies. The service can only operate within Taipei, but it will eventually expand to other cities. However, Ho Chen Tan, Minister of Transportation and Communications, said that Uber is not welcome if the fines aren't paid to the government; the company must switch its business registration as well in order to operate legally.|$|E

This new class of <b>information</b> system requires <b>a</b> re-examination of the philosophical foundations of design to better understand participant interaction and redesign of recombinant services in the secondary design phase so that initial design phase can support this phenomenon. We suggest four design metaphors which will shape our perception and design approach to this emerging class of cognitive- technical systems...|$|R

25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as <b>an</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) has attracted escalating concerns of researchers and industries.
