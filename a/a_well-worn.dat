This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland.

The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail.

Despite its critical regard, some critics were not as enthusiastic in their reviews of season one.

[...] Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as [...] "surprising, and maybe a little jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win".

However, Keefer stated, [...] "Even 'White Horse' [...] makes use of <b>a</b> <b>well-worn,</b> clichéd image that Swift doesn't use in any novel way." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "White Horse"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". Lucy Davies of the BBC said it demonstrated how repetitive the lyrical themes on Fearless were. She noted Swift recycled the phrase [...] "face of an angel" [...] from the album's previous track, [...] "Hey Stephen". An uncredited review from Billboard stated, [...] "The second single from Taylor Swift's top-selling CD is a beautiful, understated ballad that showcases her skill with a lyric and shines a spotlight on her signature tender, heart-on-her-sleeve vocals." [...] The review stated that the latter was accomplished by the song's production, which made Swift's vocal performance more palpable and emotive. The review also complimented the song, as something everyone could relate to. Kate Kiefer of Paste recognized it to be one of Swift's best songs.

While reviewing Fearless, Dooley selected [...] "White Horse" [...] as one of the best tracks on the album.

500|$|Despite {{the death}} or capture of 77 out of 79 men, ZAPU, from its {{base in the}} Zambian capital, Lusaka, did not regard the {{incursion}} as a failure; on the contrary, its leaders were pleased that they had inflicted some casualties on the Rhodesian African Rifles. Buoyed by what they perceived as a success, they planned another operation {{to take place in}} northern Mashonaland: about 100 men—75 ZIPRA and 25 MK—were to infiltrate the Zambezi valley and establish a series of camps, including underground caches containing food, clothing, weapons and other equipment. They were instructed to avoid the Rhodesian Security Forces [...] "at all cost" [...] while they recruited local tribesmen to the nationalist cause and trained them. Once a sufficient indigenous force existed, they were to inform Lusaka, which would then coordinate a mass uprising. The aim was not to defeat the government forces, but rather to force the British military to intervene. If the operation were a success, the MK men were to be escorted to South Africa to begin similar activities. The group, which in the actual event numbered 126, crossed the Zambezi {{around the turn of the}} year, with 34 entering Rhodesia on 28 December 1967 and the remainder joining them on the nights of 3, 4 and 5 January 1968. The guerrillas busied themselves working their way into the country, setting up camps as they went, naming each [...] "Camp One", [...] "Camp Two" [...] and so on. After two and a half months in Rhodesia the ZIPRA cadres had created five bases, each further south than the next in an almost straight line pointing due south; the fifth was about halfway between Karoi and the border and nearly due east from Makuti.
