500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> liked it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{had kind}} words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. [...] "He's not an ideologue," [...] Truesdale said in October 2002. [...] "He {{came from a}} {{management}} background, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> himself would tell you he was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person. But he was always very fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> guilty, Grace. But tell me, does Josiah Crabtree worry Mrs. Stanhope any more?" [...] {{continued}} the boy seriously.|$|R
6000|$|Gordon {{smiled in}} a {{significant}} fashion. [...] "It's our friend's affair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> {{not going to tell}} you why he did it. Still, in one sense, I 'most think it was up to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might give}} him some whiskey--only we haven't any. Still, I've seen {{this kind of thing}} happen in the Michigan lumber-camps, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> most as well without it. You want to give a man's brains time to settle down after they've had a big shake-up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is pretty}} nice. You can come if Demi don't mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't, {{because he said}} last night that he liked you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw him pass {{about five}} minutes ago, {{but he seemed to}} be in a hurry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> has gone now," [...] {{returned}} Chatterer, still whispering.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{been too}} much for me," [...] Whitwell said. [...] "I told Jombateeste he'd better keep it to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> done so. S'pose Jeff still had a sneakin' fondness for the girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{natural thing}} would be to rush the schooner," [...] he replied. [...] "But I don't know. I telephoned the captain to go at it head down and heels in air; he {{answered}} like a little man; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> getting around. <b>I</b> believe, Loudon, we'll give Trent a chance. Trent was in it; he was in {{it up to the}} neck; even if he couldn't buy, he could give us the straight tip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said you}} were mighty independent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> right; but you needn't be afraid of getting {{any more than you}} pay for. This room couldn't be let to many people, and those who would be willing to live in such a place we would not want in the house, except in a case like yours, where a friend of ours says {{everything}} is as it should be. Mr. Davis is a very nice man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, deacon, I believe you. I vow, if you hain't got {{something}} ahead in t'other world, I'd {{like to know}} who has--that's all; so, if Joe has no objections, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't have----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? Elbridge Newton? Well, I guess {{his wife}} hasn't forgot {{what you did}} for them when their little boy died, if he has, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> hasn't gone for any officer! Where did you see him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are doing}} the favor, father," [...] said the girl. [...] "He knows that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't {{know where to look}} if you refused. And, after all, what's {{happened}} now is as much my doing as his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just the same, Jack, {{you know}} well enough hardly any other fellow in the school would have squealed," [...] cried Randy. [...] "Codfish always was a sneak, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> always will be, no matter {{what some of the}} other fellows do for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll {{be right}} if he does," [...] {{answered}} her sister. [...] "It's the way father always does talk. You never noticed it so much, that's all. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>he</b> can't make allowance for father's bragging, he'll {{be a little}} too good. I enjoyed hearing the Colonel go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Tooting, {{somewhat}} contemptuously. [...] "No, I {{tell you}} he hasn't got that kind of sense. He never took any trouble to get ahead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> sort of sensitive about old Hilary. It'd make {{a good deal of}} a scandal in the family, with Austen as an anti-railroad candidate." [...] Mr. Tooting lowered his voice to a tone that was caressingly confidential. [...] "I tell you, and you sleep on it, a man of your brains and money can't lose. It's a chance in a million, and when you win you've got this little State tight in your pocket, and a desk in the millionaire's club at Washington. Well, so long," [...] said Mr. Tooting, [...] "you think that over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{bought her}} from old Kovudoo," [...] he said. [...] "That {{is all that}} this fellow will tell me. He pretends that he knows nothing more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>he</b> does not. These two white men were very bad men. They did many things that their boys knew not the {{meanings}} of. It would be well, Bwana, to kill the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Stirling, with a curtness {{at which}} Weston {{could not take}} offense. [...] "He can put in the evening that way if it's necessary. It will supple him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> needs it. I have a rig ready. You're coming along with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She wants {{a drop of}} oil," [...] he explained, {{and looking}} round him pointed out across the prairie. [...] "Seems as if Shafter was through with his harvest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> has to sell. Some of the storekeepers have been putting the screw on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. He {{spent several}} days here before you came. He is an old, retired, and very rich silk {{manufacturer}} from Lyons, they say, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> is {{alone in the}} world, for he always looks sad and dreamy, and doesn't talk with anybody. His name is Theophile Magnan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's like this," [...] {{continued}} the farmer. [...] "He's progressive in his idees, 'n' {{at the same}} time <b>he's</b> spiritual-minded; <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> suits pretty well all round. Of course you can't suit everybody. There's always got to be a dog in the manger, it don't matter where you go. But if anybody was to ask me, I should say Mr. Peck suited. Yes, I don't know but what I should." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{just came}} up, threw one snowball, <b>and</b> ran away. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> meant to hit {{somebody}} else and the snowball hit Mr. Felps instead," [...] {{went on the}} small boy. [...] "Don't let him know I told you, or he'll wax me good for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I went to {{the gentleman}} <b>and</b> asked him. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> ought to know. And now, if you'll come up there, I'd just like to show those people that they can't talk out loud about the other {{passengers}} and have nobody know what they're saying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so. I'm {{getting down}} and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn't got any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't gee {{together}} somehow--but he's pretty cute, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't quit {{if there was any}} chance of success--now, would he?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rectus had {{to agree}} to all Mr. Chipperton said--or, at least, he couldn't differ with him,--for he didn't know {{anything}} on earth about the matter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was glad enough when he got through. I'm sure I was. Rectus didn't say anything except {{that he was very}} sorry that the Chipperton family had to go home, and then he walked off to his room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to set}} a {{good deal}} by the battle of Bunker's Hill," [...] he continued. [...] "I thought the whole Revolution and {{subsequent}} history revolved round it, and that it gave us all liberty, equality, and fraternity at a clip. But the Lord always finds some odd jobs to look after next day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>He</b> didn't clear 'em all up at Bunker's Hill." ...|$|E
5000|$|Langley also {{confirmed}} reports that Todd {{would attempt to}} steal Marcus away from Maria. He added that Todd would manipulate and use Sean {{in his efforts to}} impress and attract Marcus. But Maria is unaware of Todd's intentions towards her partner. Of Todd's motives, Langley said that [...] "he likes a challenge <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he’s</b> probably {{one of those people who}} likes the drama of splitting couples up. It’s all for his own ego and just to prove that he can." [...] The actor was happy with Todd's changed personality. He noted that Todd spent years living away from home and it would have been a bad decision for him to return exactly the same person. Todd's manipulation of Sean is soon exposed by Brian Packham (Peter Gunn). Todd reveals that he could never be attracted to Sean and Brian informs him. To gain revenge Todd exposes secrets to his girlfriend Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). Langley told a reporter from New! that [...] "Todd was really angry so he decided to wreck his relationship with Julie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ben won't tell of them, or let us. He says he'll fight his own battles, <b>and</b> hates tell-tales. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't {{like to have}} us tell you, but I don't care, for it is too bad!" [...] and Betty looked {{ready to}} cry over her friend's tribulations.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I've had nothing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{only know}} what I see. I see that thing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> Well," [...] <b>he</b> added, [...] "it comes as pat as in a play, for I've {{precisely}} turned up this morning--as I {{would have done}} yesterday, but it was impossible--to take you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{listened with}} nods {{of his head}} at the names and facts given. [...] "Guess you won't have to get Baker up for that. I can tell you what there is to tell. I don't know where your young man is now, but I gave him an order for a bed at the Wayfarer's Lodge last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> slept there. You a friend of his?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. She {{got sick}} 'most two weeks ago, and talks of a pain that only leaves her when she's sleeping. One {{of the boys}} drove in to the {{railroad}} for the doctor, but he's busy down there. Any way, {{it would have taken}} him 'most a week to get here and back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> knew I hadn't the dollars to pay him with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like that}} boy first-rate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> likes me, though I didn't know where Nantucket ought to go. He {{wants me to}} teach him to ride when he's on his pins again, and Miss Celia says I may. She {{knows how to make}} folks feel good, don't she?" [...] and Ben gratefully {{surveyed}} the Arab chief, now his own, though the best of all the collection.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{a splendid}} fellow, Boardman is, Alice!" [...] cried Dan. [...] "You {{ought to have}} seen how he fought his way through college on such a little money, and never skulked or felt mean. He wasn't {{appreciated}} for it; the men don't notice these things much; but he didn't {{want to have it}} noticed; always acted as if it was neither here nor there; <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> sends out home whatever he has left after keeping soul and body together every week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Drayton continued, [...] "the idea's not my own. It was {{a mineral}} prospector--a {{relative}} of mine--who struck the valley {{on his last}} trip. He's an old man, and he came down played out <b>and</b> sick. Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> slowly dying." [...] He paused a moment. [...] "Would {{you like to see}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was very}} much {{surprised}} at your determination to give up Brill, <b>and</b> join Dick. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was afraid Dick would have to shoulder the business alone. And by the way, Tom," [...] went on the youngest Rover, earnestly, [...] "somehow it doesn't seem just right to me that I should put all this work off on you and Dick." ...|$|R
