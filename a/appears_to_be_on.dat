25|$|The Cottage, No. 11 Stockton Lane, {{dates from}} c. 1800 and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Robert Cooper's map of 1832. It was called Belle Vue Cottage in 1834, {{when it was}} {{occupied}} by Mr. John Scott, in 1846, when it was occupied by Henry Janson, gent., and in 1850 (Directories; OS). It is a double-fronted cottage with rendered walls and a hipped roof and was extended c. 1840. It has an enriched door-case of mid 18th-century date, brought from elsewhere.|$|E

They receive an invitation from the Lord Mayor of London to attend a ball at the Mansion House for [...] "Representatives of Trade and Commerce". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, {{to find that the}} gathering is undistinguished. [...] Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.|$|E
500|$|It is {{commonly}} and mistakenly {{thought that if}} the condensation funnel of a tornado does not reach the ground, then the tornado cannot cause substantial damage. This is another deadly myth. A tornado <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the ground only when its condensation funnel descends to the surface, but this is misleading. The circular, violent surface winds, not the condensation funnel, are what both define the tornado and cause the tornado's damage. Spotters should keep sight of swirling debris directly under any visible funnel or rotating wall cloud, even if such structures appear to not descend entirely to the ground. [...] Additionally, tornadoes can be wrapped in rain and thus may not be visible at all.|$|E

500|$|The safety {{concerns}} regarding the LHC collisions have attracted widespread media attention. Various widely circulated newspapers have reported doomsday fears {{in connection with}} the collider, including The Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sydney Morning Herald, and Time. Among other media sources, CNN mentioned that [...] "Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise," [...] but it assured its readers with comments from scientists like John Huth, who said that it was [...] "baloney". MSNBC said that, [...] "there are more serious things to worry about" [...] and allayed fears that [...] "the atom-smasher might set off earthquakes or other dangerous rumblings". The results of an online survey it conducted [...] "indicate that a lot of [...] know enough not to panic". The BBC stated, [...] "the scientific consensus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the side of CERN's theorists" [...] who say the LHC poses [...] "no conceivable danger". Brian Greene in the New York Times reassured readers by saying, [...] "If a black hole is produced under Geneva, might it swallow Switzerland and continue on a ravenous rampage until the Earth is devoured? Itâ€™s a reasonable question with a definite answer: no." ...|$|E

Another legend states that a Buddhist priest impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial king used his supernatural powers to carry the rock to its current place, specifically choosing the rock as the resemblance to the monks head. It is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the Shwedagon Pagoda and [...] the Mahamuni Pagoda.|$|E

2500|$|A new resort, the Lake Muhazi Golf & Country Resort and Boulevard, {{is planned}} for the {{southern}} shore of the lake, on the Gati Peninsular. The project was launched in 2006 at the Kigali Serena Hotel (formerly the Intercontinental Hotel), and was anticipated to be constructed in three phases. If completed as announced, the resort will occupy a site [...] acres in area and will feature 52 housing units, a golf course and a country resort. The contract for the first phase was awarded in June 2007, with a value of over US$26.6 million and estimated construction time of 18 months. As of 2010, however, {{there is no evidence}} that work has begun and the project <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> hold or cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|Insurers {{have the}} right to cancel {{individually}} purchased insurance if the insurer finds that the applicant provided incomplete or inaccurate information on the application, thereby affecting the medical underwriting process. The practice, called rescission, protects insurers from intentional fraud and affects only about 1% of individual policyholders but <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the increase. Rescission practices by several large insurers have attracted media attention, class-action lawsuits, and regulatory attention in several states. In 2007, California passed legislation to tighten the rules governing rescissions. [...] In December 2007, a California appeals court ruled that a health insurer could not rescind coverage without showing that either the policyholder willfully misrepresented health or that the insurer had investigated the application before issuing coverage.|$|E
2500|$|According to scholar Johannes D.

2500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Eminem {{appears in a}} {{recording}} studio, rapping his verse in [...] "No Love." [...] American hip hop producers Just Blaze, The Alchemist and Denaun Porter make cameo appearances in the studio. When the boy arrives home from school, his parents see his injuries and begin arguing. The boy leaves to go skateboarding. After listening to Eminem and Lil Wayne, he is motivated and soon has the urge {{to stand up to}} the bullies. He arrives wearing a hoodie. At first the boy gets knocked down, but gets back up. At this moment, Eminem finishes his verse and starts singing the chorus. The scenario appears to play out in several ways where in one scene the boy appears to strike one of the bullies and then runs, only to be caught by them. In the next scene, he <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> top of one of the bullies and strikes him yet near the end it only appears he postures against the bullies and then walks away. Eminem also finishes his session and leaves to end the video.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Alice finds {{a picture}} in the {{newspaper}} of George and Angela boating with friends, and realizes that George lied to her about his intentions for wanting {{to go to the}} lake. During a dinner which is attended by the Eastman and Vickers families, George <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of finally advancing into the business and social realm that he has long sought. However, Alice phones the house during the dinner party, and asks to speak with George; she tells him that she is at the bus station, and that if he doesn't come to get her, she'll come to where he is and expose him. Visibly shaken, he announces to the families that his mother is ill, and that he must suddenly leave, but promises Angela that he will return. The next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married, but they find it closed for Labor Day. Relieved, George then suggests spending the day at the nearby lake; Alice unsuspectingly agrees.|$|E
2500|$|The first review {{appeared}} in the New York Atlas for 25 May, followed by more than thirty others until as late as September. Only two of the thirty-three reviews and notices critic Johannes D. Bergmann read [...] "seem seriously negative." [...] Most of the others were full of praise, especially for [...] "Bartleby," [...] "Benito Cereno," [...] and [...] "The Encantadas." [...] Several reviewers singling out [...] "Bartleby" [...] and [...] "The Bell-Tower" [...] compare the stories to Edgar Allan Poe's work. Sealts saw thirty-seven reviews, five of which were [...] "preponderantly unfavorable," [...] among them the sole British review, which {{appeared in}} the London Athenaeum for 26 July. Yet the reviews showed that the book [...] "manifestly pleased his critics as no other work from his pen had done since the appearance of Redburn and White-Jacket in 1849 and 1850. Most reviews were unsigned, and not all singled out any individual story, but merely described the collection as a whole. On 9 July 1856, the Springfield Republican compared the collection to Hawthorne's best work, [...] "Marked by a delicate fancy, a bright and most fruitful imagination, a pure and translucent style and a certain weirdness of conceit."

60|$|But now the Spectre of the Brocken is {{no longer}} an object of fear. Why? Because men have found him out, and he is nothing in the world but a shadow. When the sun is in the right position, an ordinary-sized man on a lower {{mountain}} will see a gigantic shadow of himself thrown upon a cloud beyond the Brocken, though it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the mountain itself, and it is so perfect a representation {{that it is difficult to}} believe it is only a shadow. But it can be easily proved. If the man stoops to pick up anything, down goes the spectre; if he raises his hand, so does the spectre; if he takes a step of two feet, the spectre takes one of miles; if he raises his hat, the spectre politely returns his salute.|$|E
60|$|How, {{then can}} we {{account for the}} {{increase}} of such a species? One cause is undoubtedly {{to be found in}} the removal by gamekeepers of its three chief enemies--the carrion crow, magpie, and jay--all these three being great devourers of pigeon's eggs, which of all eggs are most conspicuous and open to attack. Then again the winter immigration of wood-pigeons from northern Europe <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the increase, and it may be conjectured that a considerable number of these visitors remain annually to breed with us. There has also been an increase in the stockdove and turtle-dove in recent years, and the former species is extending its range in the north. The cause or causes of the increase of the turtledove are not far to seek. Its chief feathered enemies, the egg and fledgling robbers, are the same as the wood-pigeon's; moreover, the turtledove is least persecuted by man of our four pigeons, and being strictly migratory it quits the country before shooting-time begins; add to this that the turtle-dove has been specially protected under Sir Herbert Maxwell's Act of 1894 in a good number of English counties, from Surrey to Yorkshire.|$|E
60|$|Our {{physical}} constitutions have, as I take it, {{more to do}} {{with the}} actions which determine other people's opinions of us (as well as with the course of our own lives) than we generally suppose. A man with delicately-strung nerves says and does things which often lead us to think more meanly of him than he deserves. It is his great misfortune constantly to present himself at his worst. On the other hand, a man provided with nerves vigorously constituted, is provided also with a constitutional health and hardihood which express themselves brightly in his manners, and which lead to a mistaken impression that his nature is what it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the surface. Having good health, he has good spirits. Having good spirits, he wins as an agreeable companion on the persons with whom he comes in contact--although he may be hiding all the while, under an outer covering which is physically wholesome, an inner nature which is morally diseased. In the last of these typical men, I saw reflected--Nugent. In the first--Oscar. All that was feeblest and poorest in Oscar's nature had shown itself on the surface in past times, to the concealment of its stronger and its nobler side. There had been something hidden in this supersensitive man, who had shrunk under all the small trials of his life in our village, which had proved firm enough, when the greatness of the need called on it, to sustain the terrible disaster that had fallen on him. The nearer I got to the end of my journey, the more certain I felt that I was only now learning (bitterly as he had disappointed me) to estimate Oscar's character at its true value. Inspired by this conviction, I began already to face our hopeless prospects boldly. As long as I had life and strength to help her, I determined that Lucilla should not lose the man, whose best qualities I had failed to discover until he had made up his mind to turn his back on her for ever.|$|E
