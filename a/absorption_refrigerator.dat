25|$|The {{absorption}} {{cycle is}} similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).|$|E

50|$|<b>Absorption</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and {{the more}} common {{mechanical}} refrigerators both cool by the evaporation of refrigerant. (Evaporation of a liquid causes cooling, as for example, liquid sweat on the skin evaporating feels cool, and the reverse process releases lots of heat.)

50|$|Another {{difference}} between the two types is the refrigerant used. Compressor refrigerators typically use an HCFC or HFC, while <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerators</b> typically use ammonia or water.|$|R

50|$|An {{absorption}} heat pump is an air-source heat pump driven not by electricity, but by a heat source such as solar-heated water, or geothermal-heated water. <b>Absorption</b> <b>refrigerators</b> also work on the same principle, but are not reversible and cannot serve as a heat source.|$|R

40|$|The {{extension}} of thermodynamics into the quantum regime has received much attention in recent years. A primary objective of current {{research is to}} find thermodynamic tasks which can be enhanced by quantum mechanical effects. With this goal in mind, we explore the finite-time dynamics of <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerators</b> composed of three qubits. The aim of this finite-time cooling is to reach low temperatures {{as fast as possible}} and subsequently extract the cold particle to exploit it for information processing purposes. We show that the coherent oscillations inherent to quantum dynamics can be harnessed to reach temperatures that are colder than the steady state in orders of magnitude less time, thereby providing a fast source of low-entropy qubits. This effect demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones, reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields, and is applicable to a broad range of technologically important scenarios.

50|$|Adsorption {{refrigeration}} is {{very similar}} to absorption refrigeration (note that the second letter is different.) The difference is that in adsorption refrigeration, the working fluid molecules adsorb onto the surface of a solid instead of dissolving into a fluid. The step in which heat is added results in working fluid molecules desorbing from the solid. With these differences in mind, most of what is said in the <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerator</b> article applies to adsorption refrigerators.|$|E

RVs are subject to conditions that make the design of their refrigerators challenging. The main challenges are vehicle vibration, accelerations, the energy required to drive the refrigeration process, and the off-level nature of vehicles. The absorption type refrigerator overcomes most of these design challenges and this is why the <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerator</b> has been popular since the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Waste of the {{by-product}} heat {{is reduced}} if a cogeneration system is used, {{also known as}} a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Limitations to the use of by-product heat arise primarily from the engineering cost/efficiency challenges in effectively exploiting small temperature differences to generate other forms of energy. Applications utilizing waste heat include swimming pool heating and paper mills. In some cases, cooling can also be produced by the use of <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerators</b> for example, in this case it's called trigeneration or CCHP (combined cooling, heat and power).|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a new {{irreversible}} three-heat-source refrigerator model, an ecological optimization criterion is proposed for the best mode of operation of the refrigerators, which consists of maximizing a function representing the best compromise between the cooling rate and entropy production rate. We investigate the ecological optimization performance and derive the optimal cooling rate, coefficient of performance and entropy production rate for the refrigerators. Moreover, there are some advantages in using the ecological optimization criterion; it is especially beneficial for determining the reasonable use of energy and protecting the ecological environment. The conclusions obtained here are of importance in the optimal design and reasonable use of the energy of real three-heat-source <b>refrigerators,</b> such as <b>absorption</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> adsorption refrigerators, and so on.
