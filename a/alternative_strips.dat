40|$|Deacidification in {{physical}} refining {{is one of}} the most sensitive steps in refining edible vegetable oils because of its large impact on the quality of the oil. The removal of volatile compounds such as FFA is accomplished at elevated temperatures and a high vacuum with a stripping gas, usually steam. The aim of this work was to verify, at the laboratory level, the advantages of using an <b>alternative</b> <b>stripping</b> gas, nitrogen, instead of steam. An ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium model (lVLE) was used to compare the stripping capacities of steam and nitrogen and to analyze the effects of various operational parameters (temperature, pressure, amount of stripping gas) on the residual acidity of the oil. There was no clear evidence that nitrogen showed a higher capacity to strip FFA than steam. The IVLE model seemed suitable to describe FFA laboratory distillation by using steam or nitrogen, provided the final residual content of FFA was not too low. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In the component based stream handler architecture, this process is split into three logical components; reading data, packing data and sending the data. The communication between these components are done using virtual functions. The problem we want to investigate is the cost of using the stream handler architecture and evaluate its performance against an <b>alternative,</b> <b>stripped</b> version, which uses no virtual functions. In the alternative version, the components that does the job of reading, packing and sending data to the client in the stream handler architecture, is merged together into a single component which then uses no virtual functions.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to investigate}} the possibility of substituting stripping steam with an alternative gas, which will be recycled in a closed loop at the process, without changing physical state. This modification of the atmospheric distillation process increases the revenues of the unit, compared with the conventional. The increases are justified as a 2 - 4 % wt. increase of the unitâs yield in distillates. The utilization of an <b>alternative</b> <b>stripping</b> medium has also some side advantages, as the sparing of the enthalpy of vaporization and condensation of the medium in the unit, {{the reduction of the}} demineralized water consumption and the elimination of the water dew point corrosion of the atmospheric columnâs top. The proposed modification is more environmentally friendly, because it does not produce water / hydrocarbon emulsions. The <b>alternative</b> <b>stripping</b> medium that was used {{for the purposes of the}} dissertation is the refineryâs fuel gas, which is made mainly of H 2, C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4. Ethane is found in the crude oil and it is produced mainly by the atmospheric distillation itself. Other sources are the naphtha reformer and the hydrocracker units. Hydrogen is a product of the naphtha reformer. Most of it is used at the refineryâs hydrotreaters and the surplus is mixed with the fuel gas. Ethylene is not a constituent of the crude oil. It is produced by cracking processes, mainly by the Fluid Catalytic Cracker Unit, (FCC). In order to simplify the calculations, the make - up stripping medium is considered to be pure C 2 H 6. The other reasons for its selection are: â¢ It is incondensable at the operating conditions of the atmospheric distillation. â¢ It is abundant at any refinery. â¢ It is not corrosive, because it is treated at amine absorber units, in order to remove the H 2 S. â¢ A big amount is produced by the atmospheric distillation itself. â¢ It does not condense and dissolve corrosive agents, as Î 2 Î steam does. The conclusion of the dissertation is that âdryâ stripping is feasible not only for new units, but it can also be applied to the existing ones as a revamp. The same principle can be utilized also at different processes. In fact, the conclusions of the study were utilized at the design of a new stripper column, for a lubricating oil hydrotreating unit. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the development of an electro-optical alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector different types of optical sensors as well as components of a glass fiber network for the light distribution were studied for their suitability for a possible application. For the sensors a resolution of 10 - 20 #mu#m in one and about 100 #mu#m in the other coordinate is required. Especially for the application in the ATLAS detector developed silicon strip detectors permit in their current state of development a position resolution of 5 - 7 #mu#m in the strip coordinate and 30 #mu#m in the ohter coordinate (with current division on the strip). In the combination of several sensors in a beam the beam deviation by light refraction has been proved as additional error source. as much promising <b>alternative</b> <b>strip</b> sensors of amorphous silicon have been proved. These sensors allow in both directions an equally high position resolution. With a not transparent prototype resolutions of 1. 8 #mu#m in one and 2. 3 #mu#m in the second coordinate were reached without corrections. Additionally it is possible to fabricate these sensors in transparent form on glass substrates with optical quality, which may permit a complet abandonment on corrections of the beam deviation. The transmission of these sensors amounts at a wavelength of 690 nm currently to about 60 %. By optimization of the layer thicknesses however transmission rates of up to 80 % should be reachable.
