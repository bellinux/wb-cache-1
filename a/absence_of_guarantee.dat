40|$|Recently, various {{experiments}} to apply reinforcement learning method to the self-learning intelligent control of continuous dynamic system {{have been reported}} in the machine learning related research community. The reports have produced mixed results of some successes and some failures, and show that the success of reinforcement learning method in application to the intelligent control of continuous control systems depends on the ability to combine proper function approximation method with temporal difference methods such as Q-learning and value iteration. One of the difficulties in using function approximation method in connection with temporal difference method is the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the convergence of the algorithm. This paper provides a proof of convergence of a particular function approximation method based on &quot;barycentric interpolator &quot; which is known to be computationally more efficient than multilinear interpolation...|$|E

Several regulations at the local and national levels have mandated that community/local participation rights should be guaranteed in the granting process of forest concessions. However, from 27 regulations that are reviewed, WRI found that the supposedly guaranteed local participation rights still have gaps that could potentially be violated or regarded as unbinding by some parties. In addition, most of the regulations that guarantee people 2 ̆ 7 s participation rights have yet to include a particular guarantee on women 2 ̆ 7 s rights fo participation, access, and control. In several regulations regarding the management of natural resources, forests, plantations, and space, there are still gaps and weak points regarding to the transparency of natural resource management; transparency of the issuance of environment and business permits; mechanism of forest management supervision; including supervision of the fulfillment of companies 2 ̆ 7 obligations. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> and mechanism for people 2 ̆ 7 s participation rights and involvement in the allocating process of forest concessions resulted in prolonged bloody conflicts, victimizing many civilians in various places.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{traditional}} principles of medical ethics is Medical Confidentiality, which has its important goal to protect the patient’s interest {{in the framework of}} the doctor-patient relationship. According to this principle, the information that doctors learn about their patients {{in the course of their}} professional practice should not be disclosed to others. Good medical practice depends upon patients being able to discuss openly with the doctor the aspects of their health on the understanding that such details will be kept secret. It follows that any disclosure contrary to the individual’s interest is also potentially detrimental to the public interest since it may discourage confiding in the future. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> that their secrets will be protected, patients may withhold important information about their health care and also about the wellbeing of others etc. The paper also discusses the different ethical aspects of medical confidentiality, circumstances which permit disclosure, models of truth telling, historical and juridical aspects of medical confidentiality in general and in Albania...|$|R

30|$|The {{limitation}} of our link manager model discussed in Section ‘Model limitations’ {{is related to}} the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> to deal with the nonstationarity of the environment by the link manager agents. The nonstationarity of the environment comes in two ways: by the route choice made by drivers and by the actions of other link managers. In the first case, drivers changing routes even when link prices do not change can result in different rewards for the same action of the link managers. This issue can be tackled by the adoption of a reinforcement learning mechanism with context detection [22], for example, where link managers would be able to capture the dynamics of the environment. In the second case, as link managers do not learn the value of joint actions, when a link manager acts, this generates a new traffic pattern that is perceived by the other link managers. A coordination mechanism that could be adopted by the link managers can be based in difference reward [23], such as in [11]. The mechanism of difference reward considers the contribution of an agent in the global outcome, and in [11], it yielded better results compared to reward based in local perception.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Although {{the precise}} details {{are subject to}} major uncertainty, {{it seems likely that}} the process of {{population}} ageing will involve major shifts in financing, which may give rise to financial turbulence and systemic risk. The locus and scale of these effects will also depend on the predominant approach to retirement income provision. It is argued that the financial-stability risks arising from continuing with unsustainable pay-asyou-go systems would be more threatening than those arising from funding. Fiscal crises can have incalculable consequences for private financial markets, while pension funding involves more an adaptation by regulatory authorities to a more securitised and institutionalised financial system, that is likely to develop in any case. Concerning policy, for social security, the key issue is reform, so that the fiscal difficulties and their consequences for financial stability foreshadowed above do not arise. For institutional investors involved in funding, policy issues arising include the need for prudent person asset regulation, <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> generating moral hazard and international diversification of institutional portfolios, so that they are less dependent on the performance of the domestic economy than would otherwise be the case. Banks would not be immune to the side-effects of the various patterns ageing will generate, and an awareness of such risks as well a...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Sudden Stops to capital inflows in emerging economies {{may be caused}} by global capital market frictions, such as collateral constraints and trading costs, suggests that Sudden Stops could be prevented by offering price guarantees on the emerging-markets asset class. Providing these guarantees is a risky endeavor, however, because they introduce a moral-hazard-like incentive similar to those that are also viewed as a cause of emerging markets crises. This paper studies this financial frictions-moral hazard tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model in which margin constraints, trading costs, and ex-ante price guarantees interact in the determination of asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees,</b> margin calls and trading costs create distortions that produce Sudden Stops driven by occasionally binding credit constraints and Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism. Price guarantees contain the asset deflation by creating another distortion that props up the foreign investors’ demand for emerging markets assets. Quantitative simulation analysis shows the strong interaction of these two distortions in driving the dynamics of asset prices, consumption and the current account. Price guarantees are found to be effective for containing Sudden Stops but at the cost of introducing potentially large distortions that could lead to ‘overvaluation’ of emerging markets assets.

40|$|The successes or {{failures}} of monetary reforms in Latin America have {{depended on the}} financial liberalizations that accompanied them and on the peculiarities of attendant financial regulations and provis-ions. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> to make bank depositors whole in a financial crisis, for example, signifies a far different distribution of likely patterns of monetary growth and exchange-rate pressures than a more conciliatory treatment of depositors would have, even if a government is otherwise committed to tight money and a strong currency. More generally, the economic literature on monetary arrangements has shown increased appreciation of the links between official protections for financial institutions in newly liberalized envi-ronments, subsequent banking crises, and exchange-rate volatility (McKinnon and Pill 1996, Kaminsky and Reinhart 1996, Krugman 1998). Of particular concern in this context are how problems of moral hazard metastasize under financial liberalization when government guarantees abridge market discipline. This paper presents evidence of the linkages between market disci-pline, government guarantees, bank performance, and exchange-rate stability in Argentina and Mexico. As will be detailed, Mexico’s encom-passing deposit guarantee program was associated with risky lending behavior beginning during the 1991 – 92 bank privatizations.

Or, put in yet stronger terms, {{we could say}} that the boundaries of democratization processes, delineated through the action of that sector of the State, reveal {{the possibility that the}} juridical field remains immune to democratizing change. Although prevailing discourse among law professionals asserts that Penal Justice is undergoing democratization, what we have observed in practice is a strong resistance within the juridical field to assuming political responsibilities within the consolidation of democracy. This article reports analyses and conclusions formulated through observation of the Brazilian penal justice system that gave origin to the thesis entitled Penal Justice in Brazil today: democratic discourse, authoritarian practice. The research sought to reflect on contemporary criminal justice policy, which has been guided by the widening of repression and the continued use of incarceration. Such policy, carried out in Brazil {{since the beginning of the}} 1985 political opening has adjusted itself to the liberal project that is also currently underway in the country, as well as in almost the entire Western capitalist world. As we can observe, Penal Justice, even during the execution of sentences, operates in authoritarian and exclusive ways, suppressing the rights guaranteed by law to those who have been sentenced and adopting extremely repressive forms as demonstrated by the extremely sparse benefits that it concedes. Thus, in Brazil, criminality has generally been responded through severe sentences, reflected in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> constitutional rights and ample recourse to incarceration. In this vein, our contemporary democratic governments have frequently adopted a punitive stance that seeks to reaffirm the State's aptitudes for punishing and controlling criminality. © 2009 Revista de Sociologia e Política...|$|R
