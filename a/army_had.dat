5|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far {{in excess of}} the Army's needs and had to be disposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the Department of Repatriation. The <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, the <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to field and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new Australian Regular Army that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1918, the German <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> {{been fought}} to a {{standstill}} after its Spring Offensive and the Allies had sought to take the initiative. Accordingly, the Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with an attack on Amiens which {{marked the beginning of}} a series of advances by the Allies that ultimately ended the war. By late October, the New Zealand Division, commanded by Major General Andrew Russell, along with part of the British Third <b>Army,</b> <b>had</b> advanced {{to the west of the}} town of Le Quesnoy.|$|E

50|$|Since 1947, the <b>army</b> <b>has</b> waged three wars with {{neighboring}} India, and several border skirmishes with Afghanistan. Due to Pakistan's diverse geography, the <b>army</b> <b>has</b> extensive combat {{experience in a}} variety of terrains. The <b>army</b> <b>has</b> maintained a strong presence in the Arab world during the Arab-Israeli Wars, aided the Coalition Forces in the first Gulf War, and {{played a major role in}} combat in the Bosnian war as well as rescuing trapped American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. Recently, major joint-operations undertaken by the army include Operation Black Thunderstorm and Operation Rah-e-Nijat, against armed insurgents within Pakistan. The <b>army</b> <b>has</b> also been an active participant in UN peacekeeping missions.|$|R
5|$|The {{troops of}} the field armies and of the border <b>armies</b> <b>had</b> {{different}} arrangements for their accommodation. The {{troops of the}} field armies were often billeted on the civilian population, while the troops of the border <b>armies</b> <b>had</b> permanent bases.|$|R

5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian <b>army</b> <b>had</b> only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek <b>army</b> <b>had</b> never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Vatutin {{directed}} Soviet air {{assets to}} commit their main effort toward checking the III Panzer Corps' drive northward, and {{in supporting the}} attack against the XLVIII Panzer Corps. Missions were flown {{in support of the}} attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army as well, but to a limited extent. The 2nd Air <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> some 472 aircraft operational on 12 July, while the 17th Air <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 300 operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although the Serbian <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> put up fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended.

On the night of 26â€“27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.|$|E

America's <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country.

5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E

He won a major victory over the united Mongol troops on the Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.|$|E

5|$|Having {{reached a}} hill behind his army's {{original}} position, Alexios began to regroup his army from the units that had broken. He sent out messengers to rally his scattered men with news that Bryennios had been killed, showing his parade horse as evidence. At the same time, the promised Turkish reinforcements began {{arriving at the}} scene, lifting his men's morale. All the while, on the battlefield, Bryennios's <b>army</b> <b>had</b> closed around Alexios's Franks, who dismounted and offered to surrender. In the process the rebel <b>army</b> <b>had</b> become totally disordered, with units mixed and their formations disordered. Bryennios's reserves had been thrown in confusion by the Pecheneg attack, while his front lines relaxed, thinking that the battle was over.|$|E

5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry.

5|$|Manstein's forcesâ€”mostly infantryâ€”achieved a rapid {{breakthrough}} {{during the}} first days against heavy Soviet resistance. After most of {{the neck of the}} Perekop Isthmus had been taken, his forces were substantially reduced, leaving six German divisions and the Romanian Third Army. The rest of the Perekop Isthmus was captured slowly and with some difficulty; Manstein complained of a lack of air support to contest Soviet air superiority in the region. He next created a mobile reconnaissance unit to press down the peninsula, cutting the road between Simferopol and Sevastopol on 31 October. Simferopol was captured the next day. The 11th <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> captured all of the Crimean Peninsulaâ€”except for Sevastopolâ€”by 16 November.
