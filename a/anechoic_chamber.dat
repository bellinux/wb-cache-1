25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E

As guests entered the queue in the welcome center they were shown tests {{performed}} on cars and parts before being released. [...] The queue wound by different tests for tires and car doors, an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> for radio receivers, and an area for crash test dummies to be tested. [...] At the end of the queue a group of guests would be brought into a briefing room where they were shown automobile testing facilities and examples of tests being performed. [...] The host, Bill McKim (John Michael Higgins) told the guests that they would take part in some of these tests and also told the technician Sherrie what tests to set up.

2500|$|In July 1971, Bryce Jordan {{became the}} university's first {{president}} and served until 1981. At {{that time the}} campus consisted of only one facility, the Founders Building. During Jordan's 10-year tenure the university received [...] of land in 1972 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation and the campus expanded {{with the addition of}} a number of new facilities including the Hoblitzelle Hall, Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded. Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students. The university's first bachelor's degree was awarded at the school's spring commencement in 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences). Also in 1975, the School of Management opened and has become the university's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first Nobel laureate, the late Polykarp Kusch, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor. Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the Rutford Ice Stream and Mount Rutford in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. Rutford served as head of the university until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body and built the first on-campus housing. UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders. The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science is now the second-largest school at the university. By its 20th anniversary, in 1989, enrollment at UT Dallas topped 8,000. In 1990, the Texas Legislature authorized the university to admit freshman and sophomore students. [...] The Dallas philanthropist Peter O'Donnell had pushed for expansion of the university into a four-year institution. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in honor of O'Donnell's wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell. It was designed by VAI Architects and STUDIOS Architecture. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building boasts 155,000 square feet and cost $60 million to build (20% of the building materials were recycled content). [...] The new building features an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> 3D art studios, a recording studio, a motion capture lab, and other classrooms purposed for arts and technology. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building was also selected by the Nasher Sculpture Center as part of a ten location exhibit called the Nasher XChange. [...] Franklyn Jenifer became the third president of UT Dallas in 1994 and served until 2005. Under Jenifer, UT Dallas's enrollment increased from less than 8,500 to nearly 14,000.|$|E
50|$|Full <b>anechoic</b> <b>{{chambers}}</b> aim {{to absorb}} energy in all directions.

50|$|An {{acoustic}} duct or plane wave tube {{is a test}} facility used in acoustics. <b>Anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> are typically subject to a low frequency limit, governed by {{the length of the}} sound absorbing wedges employed to prevent reflections within the chamber. Test and measurement microphone calibration services are often required to be undertaken at frequencies where <b>anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> cannot be used effectively.

For angles near grazing incidence, pyramidal absorbers give a large backscattered field from the pyramid side-faces or edges. The wedge absorber was found to give small backscattered fields for near-grazing incidence.
