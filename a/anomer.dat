The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers. In the α <b>anomer,</b> the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side (trans) of the ring from the CH2OH side branch.

2500|$|The {{retaining}} mechanism {{has been}} a matter of debate, but there exists strong evidence against a double displacement mechanism (which would cause two inversions about the anomeric carbon for a net retention of stereochemistry) or a dissociative mechanism (a prevalent variant of which was known as SNi).

40|$|US National Science Foundation [CHE- 1055310, CNS- 1126438]; China Scholarship Council (CSC); National Science Foundation of China [20873106]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011 CB 808504]The block-localized wave {{function}} (BLW) method, which can derive optimal electron-localized state with intramolecular electron delocalization completely deactivated, has been {{combined with the}} polarizable continuum model (PCM) to probe the variation of the anomeric effect in solution. Currently both the hyperconjugation and electrostatic models have been called to interpret the anomeric effect in carbohydrate molecules. Here we employed the BLW-PCM scheme to analyze the energy differences between alpha and beta <b>anomers</b> of substituted tetrahydropyran C 5 OH 9 Y (Y = F, Cl, OH, NH 2, and CH 3) and tetrahydrothiopyran C 5 SH 9 Y (Y = F, Cl, OH, and CH 3) in solvents including chloroform, acetone, and water. In accord with literature, our computations show that for anomeric systems the conformational preference is reduced in solution and the magnitude of reduction increases as the solvent polarity increases. Significantly, on one hand the solute-solvent interaction diminishes the intramolecular electron delocalization in beta <b>anomers</b> more than in alpha <b>anomers,</b> thus destabilizing beta <b>anomers</b> relatively. But on the other hand, it reduces the steric effect in beta <b>anomers</b> much more than alpha <b>anomers</b> and thus stabilizes beta <b>anomers</b> relatively more, leading to the overall reduction of the anomeric effect in anomeric systems in solutions...|$|R

50|$|The α and β anomers are diastereomers of {{each other}} and usually have {{different}} specific rotations. A solution or liquid sample of a pure α <b>anomer</b> will rotate plane polarised light by a different amount and/or in the opposite direction than the pure β <b>anomer</b> of that compound. The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each <b>anomer</b> and their ratio in the solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} {{rotation of}} the sample is the weighted sum of the optical rotation of each <b>anomer</b> weighted {{by the amount of}} that <b>anomer</b> present. Therefore, one can use a polarimeter to measure the rotation of a sample and then calculate the ratio of the two anomers present from the enantiomeric excess, as long as one knows the rotation of each pure <b>anomer.</b> One can monitor the mutarotation process over time or determine the equilibrium mixture by observing the optical rotation and how it changes.|$|E

40|$|The α and β glucose pentaacetates {{are known}} sugar derivatives, {{which can be}} {{potentially}} used as stabilizers of amorphous phase of active ingredients of drugs (API). In the present work, crystallization behavior of equimolar mixture of α and β form in comparison to both pure <b>anomers</b> is revealed. It was shown that despite the same molecular interactions and similar molecular dynamics, crystallization from amorphous phase is significantly suppressed in equimolar mixture. Time dependent X-ray diffraction studies confirmed higher stability of the quenched amorphous equimolar mixture. Its tendency to crystallization is about 10 times lower than for pure <b>anomers.</b> Calorimetric studies revealed that the α and β <b>anomers</b> don’t form solid solutions and have eutectic point for xα = 0. 625. Suppressed crystallization tendency in the mixture is probably caused by the altered thermodynamics of the system.

5000|$|The sugars glucose and {{galactose}} are epimers. In glucose, the -OH {{group on}} the first carbon is in the axial position, the direction opposite the -OH group on carbon C-4. In galactose, the -OH group is oriented in the same direction, the equatorial position. In cyclical compounds like these, the -OH group on C-1 may lie in opposite directions as well. This structural difference distinguishes two <b>anomers.</b> The two molecules pictured are both epimers and <b>anomers</b> (as indicated by the α and β designation).The stereoisomers β-D-glucopyranose and β-D-mannopyranose are epimers because they differ only in the stereochemistry at the C-2 position.

No chemical shift difference between the free and bound states for NTFAGalN and Me beta NTFAGalN, and 0. 01 -ppm chemical shift change for Me alpha NTFAGalN, demonstrate that the Me alpha NTFAGalN has a sufficiently long residence time on the protein binding site as compared to Me beta NTFAGalN and the free <b>anomers</b> of NTFAGalN. The sugar <b>anomers</b> were found in slow exchange with the binding site of agglutinin. Consequently, we obtained their binding parameters to the protein using line shape analyses. Aforementioned analyses of the activation parameters for the interactions of these saccharides indicate that the binding of alpha and beta <b>anomers</b> of NTFAGalN and Me alpha NTFAGalN is controlled enthalpically, while that of Me beta NTFAGalN is controlled entropically.

Oligo-[beta] deoxynucleotides are short-lived inside oocytes (half-life approximately equal to 10 min).

The half-life of such substituted oligodeoxynucleotides is increased to 40 minutes. Oligo-[alpha]-deoxynucleotides are quite resistant to both endo and exonucleases inside Xenopus oocytes. After 8 hours only 40 % of a 16 -mer oligo-[alpha]-deoxynucleotide were hydrolysed.
