40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the hypothesis that sub-talar joint pronation (i. e. rearfoot motion) is a shock <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanism</b> during locomotion. Forty-seven males and 48 females served as subjects by walking/running on a treadmill at 6 different locomotor speeds while instrumented with a tibial accelerometer and a rearfoot goniometer. Correlations were performed between rearfoot and impact shock parameters. The results indicated that peak g was negatively correlated with maximum rearfoot angle (r=-O. 35) and positively correlated with total rearfoot motion (r=O. 60). However, in both cases, the common variance between the parameters was low. It must be concluded that the actions of rearfoot pronation during locomotion are, at best, a peripheral but not a major shock <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> KEY WORDS: rearfoot molion, pronation, impact shock, accelerometry. INTRODUCTION: Rearfoot motion has been used to define pronation/supination of the subtalar joint. In this study, rearfoot motion was estimated using the measure of calcaneal eversion/inversion with respect to the leg. The subtalar joint is located between the talus and the calcaneus. During this motion, the talus functions as a part of the leg, whereas durin...|$|E

40|$|Insulin attenuates the {{contractile}} {{responses of}} vascular smooth muscle (VSM) to various agonists. Insulinopenic and insulin-resistant rats lack this normal attenuation of vascular contractile responses. To study this <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{the effects of}} insulin on calcium (Ca 2 +) responses of cultured VSM cells (a 7 r 5) to arginine vasopressin (AVP) and membrane potential were investigated. Insulin (1 and 100 mU/ml) shifted AVP dose-response curves to the right, reducing relative potency of AVP by 16 -fold and 220 -fold, respectively. Responses to AVP were significantly attenuated within 30 min of insulin application. The AVP-elicited rise in [Ca 2 +]i was partially dependent upon extracellular Ca 2 +. AVP-elicited inward current was reduced by 90 min of insulin treatment (100 mU/ml), from a peak current of - 103 +/- 27 pA (normal) to - 37 +/- 15 pA (insulin treated). Peak voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) -dependent inward current was unaffected by insulin; however, the current-voltage curve was shifted 16 +/- 3 mV to the right by insulin. Thus, insulin may reduce VSM contractile responses by attenuating agonist-mediated rises in [Ca 2 +]i mediated, in part, by reductions in Ca 2 + influx through both receptor- and voltage-operated channels...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} death worldwide, despite the {{availability}} of effective chemotherapy and a vaccine. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), the tuberculosis vaccine, is an attenuated mutant of Mycobacterium bovis that was isolated after serial subcultures, yet the functional basis for this attenuation has never been elucidated. A single region (RD 1), which is absent in all BCG substrains, was deleted from virulent M. bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and the resulting ΔRD 1 mutants were significantly attenuated for virulence in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. The M. tuberculosis ΔRD 1 mutants were also shown to protect mice against aerosol challenge, in a similar manner to BCG. Interestingly, the ΔRD 1 mutants failed to cause cytolysis of pneumocytes, a phenotype that had been previously used to distinguish virulent M. tuberculosis from BCG. A specific transposon mutation, which disrupts the Rv 3874 Rv 3875 (cfp- 10 esat- 6) operon of RD 1, also caused loss of the cytolytic phenotype in both pneumocytes and macrophages. This mutation resulted in the attenuation of virulence in mice, as the result of reduced tissue invasiveness. Moreover, specific deletion of each transcriptional unit of RD 1 revealed that three independent transcriptional units are required for virulence, two of which are involved in the secretion of ESAT- 6 (6 -kDa early secretory antigenic target). We conclude that the primary <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanism</b> of bacillus Calmette–Guérin is the loss of cytolytic activity mediated by secreted ESAT- 6, which results in reduced tissue invasiveness...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{characteristics of}} an oil sands tailings water (OSTW) mixture of naphthenic acids were determined using a batch partitioning method for two soils from the Alberta oil sands region. The soils were mineral peat mixtures produced during salvage operations, with Soil 1 having a higher organic carbon fraction (foc) than Soil 2. Naphthenic acids are a significant toxic byproduct of bitumen extraction, and are acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. The sorption of naphthenic acids as affected by a high ionic strength solution was examined using a synthetic groundwater (SGW) mixture. The adsorption isotherms {{were found to be}} linear in all cases. All tests were conducted at 4 oC, and at a pH of 8. 0 ± 0. 4, reflective of the conditions in a tailings settling facility near Fort McMurray, AB. The adsorption characteristics of the naphthenic acids in the SGW solution were compared to that of the mixture in Milli-Q water for the two soils. In the presence of SGW, the adsorption coefficient (Kd) for the mixture of naphthenic acids on Soil 1 was an order of magnitude higher than that observed with the same soil and the Milli-Q water mixture, increasing from 1. 9 ± 0. 2 mL/g to 17. 8 ± 1. 5 mL/g. The adsorption coefficient for the mixture of naphthenic acids on Soil 2 was also observably higher in the SGW mixture, increasing from 1. 3 ± 0. 15 mL/g to 3. 7 ± 0. 2 mL/g. In order to determine whether preferential sorption is exhibited by a particular species within the mixture, the relative fractional abundance of the individual naphthenic acids was plotted as a 3 -dimensional histogram for carbon numbers 5 to 37. It was found that for all Z families (where Z {{is a measure of the}} number of carbon ring structures), naphthenic acids within the middle range of carbon numbers showed preferential sorption. A two sample t-test confirmed that the naphthenic acids in the carbon number groupings 15 to 24 and 25 to 37 sorbed significantly in the SGW mixture when compared to those in the carbon number grouping of 5 to 14. It was concluded that select constituents of oil sands naphthenic acids mixtures sorb strongly to soil under conditions of elevated salinity and therefore adsorption could be an important <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanism</b> in groundwater transport. Furthermore, preferential sorption of the individual naphthenic acids is important with respect to toxicity since lower molecular weight naphthenic acids are believed to have a more pronounced toxic effect. Overall, the measured adsorption coefficients indicate that there can be significant sorption of OSTW derived naphthenic acids to soils...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptides make {{up one of}} {{the largest}} and {{functionally}} most diverse groups of signaling molecules. They exert their effects by interacting with members of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors, which transmit information about the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell by interacting with the heterotrimeric G-proteins. Cellular responses to neuropeptides are usually rapidly <b>attenuated.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> of signal attenuation include removal of peptides from the extracellular fluid and receptor desensitization. Peptides are removed from the extracellular fluid principally by enzymatic degradation by cell surface enzymes, exemplified by neutral endopeptidase. Receptor desensitization is mediated by receptor phosphorylation by G-protein receptor kinases and second messenger kinases, interaction of receptors with arrestins, and consequent receptor uncoupling from G-proteins. Peptides also induce endocytosis of their receptors, which may contribute to desensitization by depleting the cell surface of high-affinity receptors. Recycling and processing of internalized receptors, which include dissociation of receptors from their ligands and receptor dephosphorylation, contribute to resensitization of cellular responses. These regulatory mechanisms are important for they determine the ability of cells to respond to agonists, and defects may result in uncontrolled stimulation of cells, which could cause disease.

This research aimed to explore the effect of processing on cardiac efficacy of alkaloids in Aconitum tubers. First, the chemical ingredients in unprocessed and processed Aconitum tubers were identified and compared by using high performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF/MS) and multivariate pattern recognition methods. Then the representative alkaloids in Aconitum tubers, aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine, which belong to diester-diterpenoid alkaloids, monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids, and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids, respectively, were selected for further validation of <b>attenuated</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Subsequent pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats were used for validate the effect of processing on cardiac functions. After processing the Aconitum tubers, {{it was found that the}} contents of diester-diterpenoid alkaloids were reduced, and those of monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids were increased, suggesting that diester-diterpenoid alkaloids were transformed into monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids. Through further decocting the aconitine in boiling water, it was confirmed that the three alkaloids could be progressively transformed. Pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats showed that aconitine at a dose of 0. 01  mg/kg and aconine at a dose of 10  mg/kg enhanced the cardiac function, while benzoylaconine at a dose of 2  mg/kg weakened the cardiac function. The effect of processing is attributed to the transformation of the most toxic diester-diterpenoid alkaloids into less toxic monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids...|$|R
40|$|The {{large and}} {{functionally}} {{diverse group of}} G-protein-coupled receptors includes receptors for many different signalling molecules, including peptide and non-peptide hormones and neuro-transmitters, chemokines, prostanoids and proteinases. Their principal function is to transmit information about the extracellular environment to {{the interior of the}} cell by interacting with the heterotrimeric G-proteins, and they thereby participate in many aspects of regulation. Cellular responses to agonists of these receptors are usually rapidly <b>attenuated.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> of signal attenuation include removal of agonists from the extracellular fluid, receptor desensitization, endocytosis and down-regulation. Agonists are removed by dilution, uptake by transporters and enzymic degradation. Receptor desensitization is mediated by receptor phosphorylation by G-protein receptor kinases and second-messenger kinases, interaction of phosphorylated receptors with arrestins and receptor uncoupling from G-proteins. Agonist-induced receptor endocytosis also contributes to desensitization by depleting the cell surface of high-affinity receptors, and recycling of internalized receptors contributes to resensitization of cellular responses. Receptor down-regulation is a form of desensitization that occurs during continuous, long-term exposure of cells to receptor agonists. Down-regulation, which may occur during the development of drug tolerance, is characterized by depletion of the cellular receptor content, and is probably mediated by alterations in the rates of receptor degradation and synthesis. These regulatory mechanisms are important, as they govern the ability of cells to respond to agonists. A greater understanding of the mechanisms that modulate signalling may lead to the development of new therapies and may help to explain the mechanism of drug tolerance...|$|R

South bears much {{of the burden of}} the domestic HIV epidemic. This study seeks to explore the dynamic effects of HIV-related stigma on health outcomes in a population of PLWH in middle Georgia. Experiences of enacted HIV stigma in the past year were assessed and participants indicated how stressful these events were and how they coped with the most impactful event. The primary study aim tested a moderated serial mediation model of HIV stigma on health in this population. Method – A total of 199 people living with HIV completed surveys via audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI) while they attended their regular clinic appointment at a Ryan White clinic located in Macon, GA. Measures included demographics, health information, experiences of enacted stigma in the past year, stress and coping with the most impactful enacted stigma event. Medical information (viral load, CD 4 count, clinic attendance, and medications) was abstracted from patient charts for a period of 6 months prior to their survey date. Results – A total of 96 individuals endorsed experiencing enacted stigma in the past year, and the sample endorsed moderate levels of internalized HIV stigma. Individuals who endorsed enacted stigma tended to have more negative psychosocial and mental health outcomes. Internalized stigma related to stress indexed on the most salient event of enacted stigma in the past year as well as maladaptive coping strategies used to cope with discriminatory experiences. There was not evidence in multivariate analyses that stress or maladaptive coping mediated effects of internalized stigma on medication adherence. There was also not a moderating effect of adaptive coping strategies on medication adherence in this sample. Conclusion – HIV stigma appears to have short-term effects on mental health, which could lead to long-term effects on physical health. Longitudinal investigations are indicated to uncover the mediating and <b>attenuating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of HIV stigma on health. Stigma should be addressed in the context of health promotion interventions for PLWH given its implications on mental health and wellbeing...|$|R

But when might an adverse event that strikes one partner become too burdensome for another partner? Extant theories of alliance instability provide incomplete answers, which is problematic: for stricken organizations, anticipating whether their non-stricken partners {{will remain in the}} alliance can be essential for survival. Integrating insights from alliance dynamics and organizational stigma literatures, we theorize how an organization-specific adverse event affects a non-stricken partner's decision to continue with or defect from an alliance by considering factors that shift the balance between cohesive and disruptive forces. We propose that high stigmatization risk will increase the probability of partner defection through two disruptive mechanisms: relational uncertainty and stigma anxiety. Building on the idea that the same factors contributing to alliance formation may also condition partner defection, we theorize about the roles of partner resource interdependencies, relational embeddedness, and perceived partner similarity in amplifying or <b>attenuating</b> disruptive <b>mechanisms</b> triggered by an adverse event.

40|$|Zoopharmacognosy denotes a {{constellation}} of learned ingestive responses that promote healing and survival of infected or poisoned animals. A similar self-medication phenomenon was reported in diseased laboratory rodents. In particular, {{a series of studies}} revealed that autoimmune MRL/lpr mice readily consume solutions paired or laced with cyclophosphamide (CY), an immunosuppressive drug that prevents inflammatory damage to internal organs. However, due to design limitations, it could not be elucidated whether such a response reflects the learned therapeutic effect of CY, or a deficit in sensory input. We presently assess the behavioural effects of prolonged consumption of CY-laced, 16 % sucrose solution in a continuous choice paradigm, with tap water available ad lib.

Several distinct mutations in Factor XII (FXII) {{are associated with}} hereditary angioedema (HAE) {{in the presence of}} normal C 1 esterase inhibitor activity (FXII-HAE). The underlying disease mechanisms are unclear, which complicates diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the natural trigger for FXII activation, which causes uncontrolled bradykinin production in patients with FXII-HAE. METHODS: We generated recombinant variants of FXII, representing health and disease, and studied their behavior in functional studies. We investigated bradykinin-forming pathways in blood plasma with newly developed nanobody-based analytic methods. RESULTS: We here report that FXII-HAE mutations collectively introduce new sites that are sensitive to enzymatic cleavage by plasmin. These FXII mutants rapidly activate after cleavage by plasmin, escape from inhibition through C 1 esterase inhibitor, and elicit excessive bradykinin formation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that plasmin modulates disease activity in patients with FXII-HAE. Finally, we show that soluble lysine analogs <b>attenuate</b> this <b>mechanism,</b> explaining their therapeutic value in patients with HAE. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a new pathway for bradykinin formation in patients with HAE, in which FXII is cleaved and activated by plasmin.

40|$|SummaryTGF-β {{signaling}} {{is essential}} for development and proliferative homeostasis. During embryogenesis, maternal determinants act in concert with TGF-β signals to form mesoderm and endoderm. In contrast, ectoderm specification requires the TGF-β response to be <b>attenuated,</b> although the <b>mechanisms</b> by which this is achieved remain unknown. In a functional screen for ectoderm determinants, we have identified Ectodermin (Ecto). In Xenopus embryos, Ecto {{is essential for}} the specification of the ectoderm and acts by restricting the mesoderm-inducing activity of TGF-β signals to the mesoderm and favoring neural induction. Ecto is a RING-type ubiquitin ligase for Smad 4, a TGF-β signal transducer. Depletion of Ecto in human cells enforces TGF-β-induced cytostasis and, moreover, plays a causal role in limiting the antimitogenic effects of Smad 4 in tumor cells. We propose that Ectodermin is a key switch in the control of TGF-β gene responses during early embryonic development and cell proliferation...|$|R

Niacin is known to improve lipid metabolism and to produce beneficial modification of cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this work was to investigate if Niacin is able to modu-late pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages in a murine model of atherosclerosis. For this purpose C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice fed with atherogenic diet (AGD) or with conventional chow diet were used. The AGD group showed an increase in body weight and in total plasma cholesterol, with no differences in triglyceride or HDL levels. Lesions in arte-rial walls were observed. The characterization of Niacin receptor showed {{an increase in the}} receptor number of macro-phages from the AGD group. Macrophages from control and AGD animals treated in vitro with an inflammatory stimulus showed elevated levels of IL- 6, IL- 1 and TNF-α, that were even higher in macrophages from AGD mice.

Elevated levels of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) were found in cells exposed to HG conditions. HG also caused elevated mRNA levels of the antioxidant enzymes CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and MnSOD. These changes were accompanied by increased mRNA levels of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), fibronectin (FN) and collagen IV (CIV). Addition of antioxidants to high glucose caused a significant reversal of FN and CIV gene expression; α-lipoic acid also up-regulated γ-GCS gene expression and restored intracellular GSH and MDA levels. ConclusionsThe results demonstrate the existence of glucose-induced oxidative stress in mesangial cells as evidenced by elevated MDA and decreased GSH levels. The decreased levels of GSH are as a result of decreased mRNA expression of γ-GCS within the cell. Antioxidants caused a significant reversal of FN and CIV gene expression, suggesting an etiological link between oxidative stress and increased ECM protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} a host's immune {{response}} influences both the development and progression of a malignancy such that immune responses can have both pro- and antitumorigenic effects. Cancer immunotherapy {{is a form of}} treatment that aims to improve the ability of a cancerbearing individual to reject the tumor immunologically. However, antitumor immunity elicited by the host or by immunotherapeutic strategies, can be actively <b>attenuated</b> by <b>mechanisms</b> that limit the strength and/or duration of immune responses, including the presence of immunoregulatory cell types or the production of immunosuppressive factors. As our knowledge of tumor-induced immune suppression increases, it has become obvious that these mechanisms are probably a major barrier to effective therapy. The identification of multiple mechanisms of tumor-induced immune suppression also provides a range of novel targets for new cancer therapies. Given the vital role that a host's immune response is known to play in cancer progression, therapies that target immune suppressive mechanisms have the potential to enhance anticancer immune responses thus leading to better immune surveillance and the limitation of tumor escape. In this review, mechanisms of tumor-associated immune suppression have been divided into four forms that we have designated as (1) regulatory cells; (2) cytokines/chemokines; (3) T cell tolerance/exhaustion and (4) metabolic. We discuss select mechanisms representing each of these forms of immunosuppression that have been shown to aid tumors in evading host immune surveillance and overview therapeutic strategies that have been recently devised to "suppress these suppressors.

40|$|Seismic {{vulnerability}} of historic churches {{is a well}} known issue in earthquake engineering. The need of preserving these buildings encourages the development of reliable numerical methods to assess their seismic behavior. In this paper a new approach is presented, based on evaluating damage pattern obtained by non-linear dynamic analysis and the energy dissipated by each macro-element during earthquakes. A “hierarchy of dissipated energy” concept emerges to give a scale of {{vulnerability of}} the parts that compose the church. By modifying masonry mechanical parameters or geometric characteristics, the crack pattern and amount of energy dissipation density of each element is varied and calibrated to achieve the desired hierarchy. The structural designer can therefore state the effectiveness of strengthening devices by checking reduction and possibly migration of dissipated energy density from weaker structural elements to more resistant ones, together with a preferable damage pattern. The proposed strategy is applied to a single nave church, hit by the Emilia Romagna earthquake (Italy, 2012), first defining a scale of vulnerability of the macro-elements and then proposing a rehabilitation strategy, which improves the seismic response in terms of damages and dissipated energy. In the case study the strong vulnerability of the main dome vault was shown, due to the combination of its high dissipated energy density with its intrinsic weakness. Strengthening techniques have been aimed {{to reduce the amount}} of dissipated energy of vulnerable macro-elements and to <b>attenuate</b> out-of-plane <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|World-wide crop loss {{caused by}} insect pest and {{nematode}} reaches critical level. In Korea, similar crop loss has been gradually augmented {{in the field}} and greenhouse due to continuous crop rotation. The current methods on controlling herbivorous insects and plant parasitic nematodes are mostly depended on agro-chemicals that have resulted additional side-effect including occurrence of resistant insects and nematodes, environmental contamination, and accumulation in human body. To overcome the pitfalls, microbe-based control method have been introduced and applied for several decades. Here, we revised biological control using by the bacteria, fungi, and virus in order to kill insect and nematode and to <b>attenuate</b> its virulence <b>mechanism.</b> The introduced microbes mainly secreted out the hydrolysing enzymes and toxic compounds to target host membrane or cell wall directly. Indirectly, the microbe-triggered plant innate immunity against insects and nematodes was also reported. In conclusion, we provide a new frontier of microbe-based environmentally friendly procedure and effective methods to manage insects and nematodes...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}}-gamma (PPARγ) is {{a member}} of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily of ligand-activated transcriptional regulators. Accumulating evidence suggests that PPARγ agonists such as the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) may prove to be useful anti-cancer agents exhibiting anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic affects in a range of cancer cell types including melanoma, however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. We have demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of full and partial PPARγ modulators in human melanoma cell lines. Ablation of PPARγ expression in the MM 96 L melanoma cell line by siRNA mediated <b>mechanisms</b> <b>attenuates</b> the anti-proliferative effect of these agents suggesting this effect is directly mediated by PPARγ. The mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of PPARγ in melanoma cells involve the regulation of expression of a number of critical cell cycle genes and β-catenin. Moreover, our data indicate that PPARγ modulates Wnt/β-catenin mediated signalling in melanoma cells in an agonist dependent manner.

40|$|Overwhelming {{inflammation}} {{triggered by}} systemic infection in bacterial sepsis {{contributes to the}} pathology of this condition. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important in early septic inflammation. As a safeguard, the innate immune system has evolved to counter excessive inflammation through the induction of “tolerance. ” In endotoxin tolerance, TLR signaling is inhibited and/or <b>attenuated</b> by multiple <b>mechanisms</b> that mitigate the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate critical kinases through TLR 4. Here, we describe a novel mechanism. Protein kinase R (PKR), a kinase normally activated by a subset of TLRs, is rendered unresponsive to LPS in endotoxin-tolerized cells. In its naive state, PKR is subject to K 63 -linked ubiquitination (Ub), followed by K 48 -linked Ub, in response to LPS. In tolerance, the kinetics of this differential Ub is altered, resulting in a predominance of K 48 -linked chains, concomitant {{with a loss of}} PKR activation. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which a TLR-responsive kinase may be rendered inactive in tolerance...|$|R
