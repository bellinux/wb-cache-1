5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev came {{to power}} in the Soviet Union on March 11, 1985, and the next day {{negotiations}} on nuclear and space-based weapons began in Geneva. A few weeks later, he proposed <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations, and in July, he proposed to ban nuclear testing. Reagan rejected the proposals.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan placed <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 {{death row}} inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois {{death row inmates}}. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged {{brutality}} to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report anticipated much of the present Blue Line route in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a route in Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E

5|$|She was {{launched}} as the passenger ship Ausonia on 15 April 1915. While {{the ship was}} still being fitted out, the German navy decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier. The proposed design was completed by 1918, but by then, the majority of naval construction efforts were diverted to building new U-boats. The demands on labor and resources the war imposed on the German economy reduced the shipbuilding industry to barely being able to cover the maintenance and repair needs of the High Seas Fleet. What resources were left over were by 1918 funneled into U-boat production. As {{a result of the}} growing importance of U-boat construction and <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new surface ships imposed by the Reichsmarineamt (RMA the Imperial Navy Office), the conversion project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island did not have much time to prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden homes on the beach for sturdier brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{sea otter}} populations became so depleted, {{commercial}} hunting {{was no longer}} viable. It had stopped the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a conservation measure imposed by the Russian-American Company. Further restrictions were ordered by the Company in 1834. When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly extirpated the sea otter again. Prices rose as the species became rare. During the 1880s, a pelt brought $105 to $165 in the London market, but by 1903, a pelt could be {{worth as much as}} $1,125. In 1911, Russia, Japan, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States signed the Treaty for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals, imposing <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> the harvesting of sea otters. So few remained, perhaps only 1,000–2,000 individuals in the wild, that many believed the species would become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did {{not mean}} an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60,000 Italian {{volunteers were}} now {{operating}} in Spain, and {{the removal of}} foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, and put <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was an important issue during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.|$|E
5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was <b>a</b> <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.|$|E
