5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E

25|$|Today the {{significance}} of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now seen as strange or wrong.

25|$|Sir John Franklin {{arrived in}} Hobart Town on 5 January 1837 {{with his wife}} Lady Jane Franklin to become the 5th Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land. The colony they took command of was orientated towards {{commerce}} and industry, but lacking in culture and opportunities for education. Lady Jane was passionate about improving the town and colony, as was her husband. However, their liberal views were not well received by many members of Hobart Town's civil service, and civilians who benefited from exploiting convict labour did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> humane views.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s {{many parts}} of Old Havana, {{including}} the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, {{with the assistance of}} foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated.

25|$|In 1886, Carnegie {{wrote his}} most radical work to date, {{entitled}} Triumphant Democracy. Liberal {{in its use}} of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British monarchical system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal crown and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.|$|E

Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti.

25|$|It {{is such an}} {{interesting}} drama to see a nation create itself, that I – if I now had not been who I am – would go to America to follow up close every phase {{in the emergence of}} this new republic. – This perhaps is America's century. The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries. No matter what, I cannot help but admire their courage and enthusiastically <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> daring.|$|E

He said “the customer’s psychology always favors a busy place,” because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit.

25|$|Despite much {{chaos in}} the Empire, the Byzantines {{experienced}} a revival in culture and art within their domain. Towards the 14th century, as the Empire entered into a phase of terminal crisis, such achievements became less valued. All was not lost for these seemingly rejected scholars — many in Italy who had been opened up to Byzantium by the maritime expansions of Genoa and Venice came to <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> achievements, facilitating the Renaissance. As such these scholars found themselves in Italian institutions, expressing their Greco-Roman culture for pay. Immigration to Italy was made less attractive {{by the idea of}} abandoning the Orthodox faith to practice Catholicism. Nonetheless, a significant and increasing number of Greeks began travelling to Italy, first temporarily to Italian colonies such as Crete or Cyprus before returning to Byzantium, then as the Empire began to fail horribly, in more permanent manner. The Fall of Constantinople was marked by large numbers of Greek refugees escaping Turkic rule into Europe via Italy and thus accelerating the Renaissance.|$|E

25|$|The Germans were {{helped in}} their escape {{by the failure}} of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven {{critical}} radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet's course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to <b>appreciate</b> <b>their</b> significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and {{it was clear that the}} battle could no longer be resumed.|$|E
