25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and acted as if she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E

In fact, however, when the 1797 frigate was being dismantled at the Gosport Navy Yard near Norfolk, Virginia, work was beginning on the 1854 sloop, likely reusing some timber from the old ship in building this very new one. The misidentification was maintained by deliberate deception, apparently to enhance the likelihood of the ship's being preserved as a historic relic. Naval records and the evidence from the extant ship's hull, though, make it clear that the vessel floating today dates from 1854." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{share of}} {{flexible}} jobs on the Dutch labour market {{is among the}} highest in Western countries, in particular for recent graduates. In this study we examine why recent graduates enter into temporary contracts and whether flexible jobs match their qualifications worse than permanent jobs do. Graduates that enter into flexible jobs face large wage penalties, a worse job match and less training participation than those entering into permanent jobs, even after correcting for ability differences. When the labour market situation for a particular field of education deteriorates, a larger share of recent graduates is forced into flexible jobs, which may threaten their position on the labour market in the long run. Flexible work among graduates is unrelated to their willingness to take risks. Only for university graduates are there <b>any</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> flexible jobs may provide stepping stones to permanent jobs. Keywords: labour economics...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{structural}} change in agriculture depends on several preconditions, {{some of which}} are only indirectly linked to the farming sector. The rural non-farm economy is known as one important driver of {{structural change}} because it offers alternative employment. However, {{little is known about the}} factors that influence farm exit decisions. Based on a recent household survey of Croatian family farms, we analyse individual employment decisions of farm household members by taking a prospective look at developments to come in the medium term. We find that mixed activities and part-time farming will be at the core of expected future developments. A cumulative logit regression model is employed, showing that steps toward individual farm exit are least likely for elderly people and for those in households that are particularly successful in farming. Individual exit is more likely for better-off households. Generally, we find that there is a clear trend toward non-farm employment for individuals, but there are hardly <b>any</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> this leads to final abandonment of the farm. ...|$|R

2500|$|For example, Shakespeare {{must have}} used Hall for {{the scene where}} Gloucester is {{attempting}} {{to gain access to}} the Tower, and Woodville tells him that the order not to admit anyone came from Winchester. Dismayed, Gloucester refers to Winchester as [...] "that haughty prelate,/Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne're could brook" [...] (1.3.23–24). Only in Hall is there <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Henry V had a problem with Winchester. In Holinshed, there is nothing to suggest any disagreement or conflict between them. Another example of Shakespeare's use of Hall is found when Sir Thomas Gargrave is injured by the artillery strike at Orléans (1.5). In the play, he dies immediately, and the rest of the scene focuses on the death of the more senior soldier Salisbury. Likewise, in Hall, Gargrave dies immediately after the attack. In Holinshed, however, Gargrave takes two days to die (as he did in reality). The semi-comic scene where the French leaders are forced to flee Orléans half-dressed (dramatised in 2.1) also seems based on an incident reported only in Hall. When discussing the English retaking of Le Mans in 1428, Hall writes, [...] "The French, suddenly taken, were so amazed in so much that some of them, being not out of their beds, got up in their shirts.") Another incident involving Gloucester and Winchester is also unique to Hall. During their debate in Act 3, Scene 1, Gloucester accuses Winchester of attempting to have him assassinated on London Bridge. Hall mentions this assassination attempt, explaining that it was supposed to have taken place at the Southwark end of the bridge in an effort to prevent Gloucester from joining Henry V in Eltham Palace. In Holinshed however, there is no reference to any such incident. Another incident possibly taken from Hall is found in Act 3, Scene 2, where Joan and the French soldiers disguise themselves as peasants and sneak into Rouen. This is not an historical event, and it is not recorded in either Hall or Holinshed. However, a very similar such incident is recorded in Hall, where he reports of the capture of Cornhill Castle in Cornhill-on-Tweed by the English in 1441.|$|E

A scoping study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of scratches approximately 0. 0015 to 0. 002 inch deep on the fitness for service and bond quality. The stems were characterized using borescope before and after welding. The four stems were welded with near optimal weld parameters, proof tested, and examined metallographically. The stems were radiographed, proof tested, and examined metallographically. The scratches did not adversely affect (1) the weld integrity based on radiography, (2) the ability to withstand the proof pressure, and (3) the weld quality based on metallographic cross-sections. Based on these limited results at a nominal weld current, the weld process is very robust. It {{may be able to}} recover from manufacturing defects and inspection anomalies worse than those expected for typical fill stem manufacturing processes; additional testing specific to each application over a range of weld heats is needed to verify applicability of these results...|$|R
