30|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Ca(OH) 2 on the dental pulp is vascular and associated with cell migration, proliferation and liquefaction necrosis (necrotic pulp) (Schroder 1985). These conditions {{are required to}} promote the biomaterial mineralization and cellular differentiation. Matrix vesicles initiate the formation and diffusion of mineralized granules in the newly formed collagen layer. Secondary odontoblasts differentiate, including the so-called Hoehl’s cells and mesenchymal stem cells/pulp progenitors. <b>After</b> <b>capping,</b> crystallite structures are observed at the interface between the superficial necrotic zone and the underlying pulp tissue (Yoshiba et al. 1996). They are positively immunostained for fibronectin and still remain positive a few days <b>after</b> <b>capping,</b> with corkscrew fiber-like structures visible between the cell bodies (Yoshiba et al. 1996). After Ca(OH) 2 implantation {{for longer periods of}} time, 89  % of the dentin bridges display tunnel defects, failing to provide a hermetic seal against infection to the underlying pulp. Due to microleakage, after 6  months, most of the Ca(OH) 2 capping material disintegrates and disappears (Cox et al. 1996).|$|R

Tadzio was a boy genius whose family was killed by Axis soldiers who subjected him to the Super Soldier serum leaving him deformed and evil. Red Skull launches a missile at Washington but Captain America attacks Red Skull's base. Red Skull battles Captain America aboard the flying missile and is forced to cut off his hand to avoid death. <b>After</b> <b>Cap</b> is trapped in ice Red Skull forms a criminal organization with his daughter Valentina.

50|$|Black rot is {{probably}} the “Achilles heel” for organic grape production in the East. In the only good trial that we’ve run with copper, it provided 40% disease control when applied at 2-week intervals, versus essentially 100% control with Nova. To try to avoid this, implement a rigorous program to remove mummies during pruning, and spray copper once a week {{throughout much of the}} growing season. This was hard on some of the hybrid vines and runs counter to the thinking of many with a “sustainable” orientation (after all, copper is an element and doesn’t break down into anything else, so it stays in the soil forever), but it did control the disease in an organically acceptable manner. Limit inoculum within the vineyard. Ideally, this would include removing or burying any mummies that you might encounter at the site. All mummified clusters should be removed from the trellis during pruning and from 2 to 6 weeks <b>after</b> <b>cap</b> fall and prune out any affected clusters before they allow the disease to spread, all the better (spores for disease spread are dispersed by rain primarily within the canopy, so should pose little risk of causing new infections if said clusters are simply dropped to the ground).|$|E
5000|$|Arria {{resigned}} {{as head of}} Venezuela Tourism Corporation to create the political movement Causa Común (Common Cause) that later supported the presidential candidacy of Carlos Andrés Pérez (CAP). In 1973, Arria was elected member of the National Congress, representing the state of Miranda. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>CAP</b> was elected in March 1974, he appointed Arria Governor of the Federal District (Caracas), {{at a time when}} {{this was one of the}} most important presidential appointments. In 1976 when he was Governor of the Federal District he went to Chile to negotiate with President Pinochet the release of his friend Orlando Letelier, his colleague at the Inter American Development Bank in D.C. Pinochet released Letelier, but soon after, Letelier was murdered with a car bomb in Washington D.C by Pinochet's order. Arria intervened again by bringing Leterlier's body to be buried in Caracas, where he remained until the end of Pinochet's rule. He subsequently moved from the governorship to become Minister of Information and Tourism in February 1977. He resigned on 17 March 1978, in order to stand as an independent candidate in the Venezuelan presidential election, 1978.

50|$|Captain America is {{the leader}} of the Avengers in the JLA/Avengers limited series, in which the two super teams travel to each other's universe. His mind {{affected}} by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the Justice League as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at Superman, who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. <b>After</b> <b>Cap</b> and Batman battle to a standstill, the two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. Using an inter-dimensional vehicle that allows them to reach the Grandmaster's headquarters, they discover that the Avengers are fighting for Krona. Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. The Grandmaster causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap, still subtly aware of the reality changes, attacks Superman, who is also aware of the changes. This shatters the fixed reality, freeing Krona. Cap and Superman again argue, but are stopped by Wonder Woman. The two teams find the Grandmaster, who reveals their true realities. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the Martian Manhunter's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. After the two teams defeat Krona and restore their universes, Cap and Superman salute each other as they are transported back to their own dimensions, saying they fight on.|$|E
50|$|In the miniseries JLA/Avengers, Iron Man aids the Avengers in {{the battle}} against Starro the Conqueror. Afterwards, he creates a {{dimensional}} alarm in order to tell when invaders from another dimension come into their universe. After a brief scuffle with the JLA in the Savage Land, the Avengers are confronted by Metron, who gives Tony a Mother Box. Using this, Tony is able to get the Avengers to Metropolis, where the Avengers confront the JLA again. The Avengers escape, but Tony and Hawkeye manage to take Green Lantern's Power Battery before they leave, with Tony able to stop the Flash in his tracks. The two later take down Captain Atom and Green Arrow in order to collect the Casket of Ancient Winters. Tony then leaves and arrives to save Photon and Quasar from Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, allowing them to take the Spear of Destiny. After the battle in the Savage Land, Tony is one of the Avengers and is clueless as to the dimensional shifts that are happening around him. <b>After</b> <b>Cap</b> and Superman attack each other, Tony ends up in Metropolis. When the two worlds are briefly corrected by the Grandmaster, Tony is shown his true future with his alcoholism and his defeat by Obadiah Stane. Accepting this, he aids the JLA and the Avengers in the final battle and helped build the ship that took them to Krona's base. During the battle, he teams up with Kyle Rayner to create a weapon to use against their enemies and the two are shown to be impressed by one another, Kyle expressing his awe at Tony's engineering prowess and Tony asking Kyle where he could get a Green Lantern ring.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} sensory nerves in glucose-stimulated insulin {{secretion}} and glucose tolerance {{was investigated in}} conscious mice treated neonatally with either capsaicin (Cap) or vehicle (Veh). At 10 - 12 wk <b>after</b> <b>Cap,</b> both the early (1 min) insulin secretory response to intravenous glucose (2. 8 mmol/kg) (by 67 %) and glucose elimination were potentiated (P < 0. 05). In contrast, basal insulin, glucagon, and glucose were not affected by Cap. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels did not differ between Cap- and Veh-treated animals, whereas the increase in plasma insulin levels normally induced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine was absent <b>after</b> <b>Cap</b> treatment. In isolated islets, the insulin secretory response to glucose (20 mmol/l), carbachol (0. 1 mmol/l), or phentolamine (0. 5 mmol/l) was not affected <b>after</b> <b>Cap.</b> It is concluded that sensory denervation by Cap results in increased glucose tolerance, which is {{in part because of}} a potentiated early insulin response to glucose. This potentiation does not seem secondary to altered plasma catecholamine levels or to altered islet secretory capacity. The results suggest rather that Cap-sensitive nerves, by a local effector function and/or as the afferent loop of a neural reflex, exert inhibitory influences on insulin secretion...|$|E
