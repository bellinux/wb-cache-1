25|$|The auditor is {{responsible}} for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient’s federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.|$|E
25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the examination accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk auditees, the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have compliance issues. Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is non-compliant, just that they're more likely to be.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information that is useful to management and stakeholders for resource allocation decisions. For financial information to be useful, it should be timely and free from material errors, omissions, and fraud. In the real time economy, timely and reliable financial information is critical for day-to-day business decisions regarding strategic planning, capital acquisition, credit decisions, supplier partnerships, and so forth. Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real time information. However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|E

[...] Verification of Financial Statements, the first pamphlet dedicated exclusively to providing guidance for audits, was issued in 1929. With its opening paragraph, the guidance provided one of the most fundamental principles in auditing, stating that [...] "the responsibility for the extent of the (audit) work required must be assumed by the auditor." [...] In 1936 the AICPA revised its prior pronouncements and issued Examination of Financial Statements by Independent Public Accountants, which contained more detailed guidance on performing <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> for audits of small and mid-sized companies, while still emphasizing the need to perform the audit based on the nature of the client, its size, and its internal control structure, among other attributes.|$|E

During that time, the Securities Exchange Commission required public accountants to include a representation in their independent audit reports that the audit was performed in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards, and the Committee issued a booklet titled Generally Accepted Auditing Standards—Their Significance and Scope to adopt the SEC’s requirement.
