40|$|OBJECTIVES: Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic density {{categories}} {{are associated with}} considerable interobserver variability. Automated methods of measuring volumetric breast density may reduce variability and be valuable in risk and mammographic screening stratification. Our objective was to assess agreement of mammographic density by a volumetric method with the radiologists' classification. METHODS: Eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-two examinations from the Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial were classified according to BI-RADS, 4 th Edition. Volumetric breast density was assessed using automated software for 8433 examinations. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric breast density and BI-RADS was descriptively analyzed. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> radiologists and between categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS was calculated, rendering kappa values. RESULTS: The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> BI-RADS scores of different radiologists was 80. 9 % [kappa 0. 77 (0. 76 - 0. 79) ]. A spread of volumetric breast density for each BI-RADS category was seen. The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS scores was 57. 1 % [kappa 0. 55 (0. 53 - 0. 56) ]. CONCLUSIONS: There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric density and BI-RADS scores from European radiologists indicating that radiologists evaluate mammographic density differently than software. The automated method may be a robust and valuable tool; however, differences in interpretation between radiologists and software require further investigation. KEY POINTS: • <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> qualitative and software density measurements has not been frequently studied. • There was substantial <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> different radiologists´ qualitative density assessments. • There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> software and radiologists' density assessments. • Differences in interpretation between software and radiologists require further investigation...|$|R

Workers' compensation has been a contentious issue in Oregon for some time, as the state-run State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF) insures approximately 35% of the workforce. The legislature passed a law as a result. The changes were considered to benefit the insurance industry and business interests, {{at the expense of}} claimants, who were required to establish more extensively that their employers were responsible for injuries. The issue was contentious for some time, involving lawsuits and various efforts to modify the law. In 2000, Governor John Kitzhaber attempted to reform the system again. This led to a new law in the 2001 Legislature, which was complicated by an Oregon Supreme Court ruling that occurred during deliberations.|$|E

While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> parties.

In 1898, the MS and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
