5|$|The first {{director}} of Jodrell Bank was Bernard Lovell, who established the observatory in 1945. He was succeeded in 1980 by Sir Francis Graham-Smith, followed by Professor Rod Davies around 1990 and Professor Andrew Lyne in 1999. Professor Phil Diamond {{took over the}} role on 1 October 2006, {{at the time when}} the Jodrell Bank Centre for <b>Astrophysics</b> was formed. Prof Ralph Spencer was Acting Director during 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Prof. Albert Zijlstra became Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for <b>Astrophysics.</b> Professor Lucio Piccirillo was the Director of the Observatory from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011 when Prof Simon Garrington became its managing director.|$|E
5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer atop a hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements. AMiBA {{is the result of a}} collaboration between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and <b>Astrophysics,</b> the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility, and also involves researchers from other universities.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards <b>astrophysics.</b> He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} summit, {{the winners}} of the first Kavli Prizes were {{announced}} in a simulcast linking New York City and Oslo. The first Kavli Prize for <b>astrophysics</b> was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden-Bell for their pioneering work on quasars. Louis E. Brus and Sumio Iijima shared the nanoscience prize for their contributions to the science of quantum dots and carbon nanotubes, respectively. Pasko Rakic, Thomas Jessell and Sten Grillner were awarded the neuroscience prize for their research into how neuronal networks develop and communicate.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with <b>astrophysics.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical <b>astrophysics</b> in 1967.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar <b>Astrophysics</b> for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{focused on}} the foundations of general relativity {{as well as on}} the theory's applications to <b>astrophysics.</b> He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} on the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L using the NACO imager at the Very Large Telescope array successfully distinguished the star's mass. The collected data from VLT and from observations during the microlensing event was run {{through a series of}} models and analyzed. An orbiting planetary body larger than Jupiter (or of a similar size, given uncertainties) was discovered. The discovery of the planet was reported on February 21, 2011 in the journal Astronomy and <b>Astrophysics.</b>|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern <b>astrophysics.</b> It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern <b>astrophysics.</b> It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong that even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and <b>Astrophysics</b> of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates {{that it may be}} a planet.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the Congress {{restored}} {{funding for}} fiscal year 2008 {{as part of an}} omnibus appropriations bill which the President later signed. At the same time the Congress directed NASA to move the mission forward to the development phase. In 2009 the project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for the findings and recommendations of the Astronomy and <b>Astrophysics</b> Decadal Survey, Astro2010, performed by the National Academy of Sciences, which would determine the project's future.|$|E
