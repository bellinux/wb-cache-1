5|$|The {{study of}} the {{classification}} or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic entomology. If one works with a more specific order or even a family, the term may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> specific to that order or family, for example systematic dipterology.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{from the}} satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be}} made from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} it can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2008, it was {{announced}} The Tales of Beedle the Bard would <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available for the public, in both standard and collector's editions. The book was published by Children's High Level Group and printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Amazon.com. The decision was taken due to disappointment among Harry Potter fans after it had initially been announced a wide public release was not intended.|$|E
5|$|The project brings free, encrypted, gigabit {{wireless}} internet coverage {{to the five}} boroughs by converting old payphones into Wi-Fi hotspots where free phone calls could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> , there are 920 Links citywide; eventually, there will be 7,500 Links installed in the New York metropolitan area, making the system the world's fastest and most expansive. Intersection has also proposed installing Links in other cities such as London and Columbus, Ohio. The Links {{are seen as a}} model for future city builds as part of smart city data pools and infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E
5|$|Mention should <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of Meyerbeer's intense {{concern with}} the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Such {{plans are}} subject to {{approval}} by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment {{of many of the}} current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.|$|E
5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand geographical names.|$|E

5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> subservient to the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the political realities of the French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E
