40|$|It is {{well known}} that breast carcinomas without {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) have a poor prognosis and do not respond to <b>antiestrogenic</b> <b>therapy.</b> In analyzing the question of the lack of ER gene expression, we have considered the possibility to modify the ER gene expression by transfecting ER-negative breast cancer cells with a polymerase chain reaction product mimicking a putative negative regulatory region ( [...] 3258 / [...] 3157) inside the P 3 ER gene promoter. Here we have demonstrated the efficacy of the selected sequence used as a decoy molecule in restoring the ER gene transcription. When this DNA was complexed and delivered by cationic liposomes (PC:DOTAP) {{a significant increase in the}} decoy effect was obtained. Breast cancer cells receiving the combination treatment responded substantially better to reactivation of quiescent ER gene than cells that had received DNA with calcium phosphate. This information may be useful for a series of in vitro transfections and also for in vivo application of the decoy strategy that is a potential therapeutic tool to control disease-related genes such as ER gene in breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Mucinous {{carcinoma}} {{may present}} at various sites, including the breast and the gastrointestinal tract. Rarely, such tumors arise within the skin. Comparatively, breast lesions are relatively common and {{usually associated with}} a good prognosis. When pure, they are typically estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive and responsive to tamoxifen. The authors studied 12 mucinous carcinomas of the skin and compared the morphology with that of typical mammary lesions. The authors also evaluated for expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and the mucus-associated peptides of the trefoil factor family (TFF), TFF 1 (formerly pS 2) and TFF 2 (formerly SP), using immunohistochemistry. The localization of mRNAs for TFF 1, TFF 2, and TFF 3 (formally ITF) was also studied in a subset of three tumors, using in-situ hybridization with S 35 labeled riboprobes. The Grimelius stain was used to look for evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. Eight resembled type A mucinous carcinomas of the breast, two resembled type B, and one had composite features. The 12 th was a papillary neoplasm. The two type B tumors exhibited argyrophilia. All showed strong nuclear staining with the estrogen receptor antibody but a more varied pattern with antibodies to progesterone receptor and TFF 1. None labeled for TFF 2. The detection of TFF 1 in mammalian skin is a novel finding. Cutaneous mucinous carcinoma shows strong similarities to its mammary counterpart, including expression of estrogen receptor, TFF 1, and TFF 3 mRNA. These observations suggest that some mucinous carcinomas of the skin might respond to <b>antiestrogenic</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Alteration of the {{phenotype}} {{of breast}} cancers from estrogen-dependent to estrogen-independent growth {{often leads to}} the failure of <b>antiestrogenic</b> tumor <b>therapies.</b> We report that overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by estrogen-dependent MCF- 7 breast cancer cells could abolish estrogen-dependent tumor growth in ovariectomized mice. In the absence of estrogen, MCF- 7 VEGF-expressing tumors with in-creased vessel density showed growth kinetics similar to, or even greater than, that of parental MCF- 7 tumors with estrogen supplementation. Overexpression of VEGF by MCF- 7 cells or treatment on parental MCF- 7 cells with recombinant VEGF also stimulated cell proliferation in culture. Our data suggest that VEGF stimulation of MCF- 7 tumor angiogenesis and growth is mediated by both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms...|$|R
