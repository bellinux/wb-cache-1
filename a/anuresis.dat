50|$|Anuria, {{sometimes}} called <b>anuresis,</b> is nonpassage of urine, in practice {{is defined as}} passage of less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day. Anuria is often caused by failure in the function of kidneys. It may also occur because of some severe obstruction like kidney stones or tumours. It may occur with end stage renal disease. It is a more extreme reduction than oliguria (hypouresis), with 100 mL/day being the conventional (albeit slightly arbitrary) cutoff point between the two.|$|E
40|$|A {{formerly}} healthy 32 -year-old {{woman was}} hospitalized {{for a closer}} examination of undiagnosed fever with mild headache. Despite lack of distinct findings on physical and laboratory examinations at admission, she suddenly developed <b>anuresis</b> due to acontractile neurogenic bladder. On the basis of her symptoms and the faint nuchal rigidity revealed later, {{as well as the}} results of cerebrospinal fluid analyses, a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis was eventually reached. While aseptic meningitis subsided within 3 weeks, about 10 weeks, including a 26 -day period of anuria, was necessary for complete restoration of normal voiding function, necessitating intermittent self-catheterization. Acute urinary retention should be considered an uncommon but critical manifestation of aseptic meningitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{patient was}} a girl 2 years and seven months of age. Because of vomiting, she was {{examined}} by a pediatrician on November 25, 1993. Her condition seemed to improve a little, however on November 29, she suffered from fever and <b>anuresis,</b> and was hospitalized in a surgical department. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen and tenderness in the abdomen, but no tumor. An ultrasound examination {{was performed on the}} abdomen and a CT scan was performed on the pelvis. From the results of these tests, the patient was diagnosed with torsion of tumor in the left ovary. Peritoneotomy was performed and the result of the surgery showed that the tumor originated from the right overy, and was incarcerated in the pelvic cavity, exerting pressure on the base of the bladder. The tumor was 7 × 6 × 6 cm in size, and contained hair balls and 15 g of serum. Pathohistologically, fatty tissues, as well as developed crinis and bone tissues were found. From these findings, the tumor was was diagnosed as ovarian dermoid cyst. It is extremely rare for ovarian dermoid cyst to occur in children, and in Japan, there have been few cases of ovarian dermoid cyst in children under 7 years of age. Nonetheless, because of their age, one must be careful when handling these cysts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ureteral injury {{occurs in}} less than 1 % of blunt {{abdominal}} trauma cases, partly because the ureters are relatively well protected in the retroperitoneum. Bilateral ureteral injury is extremely rare, with only 10 previously reported cases. Diagnosis may be delayed if ureteric injury is not suspected, and delay of 36 hours or longer has been observed in more than 50 % of patients with ureteric injury following abdominal trauma, leading to increased morbidity. Case presentation A 29 -year-old man {{was involved in a}} highway motor vehicle collision and was ejected from the front passenger seat even though wearing a seatbelt. He was in a preshock state {{at the scene of the}} accident. An intravenous line and left thoracic drain were inserted, and he was transported to our hospital by helicopter. Whole-body, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed left diaphragmatic disruption, splenic injury, and a grade I injury to the left kidney with a retroperitoneal haematoma. He underwent emergency laparotomy. The left diaphragmatic and splenic injuries were repaired. Although a retroperitoneal haematoma was observed, his renal injury was treated conservatively because the haematoma was not expanding. In the intensive care unit, the patient's haemodynamic state was stable, but there was no urinary output for 9 hours after surgery. <b>Anuresis</b> prompted a review of the abdominal x-ray which had been performed after the contrast-enhanced CT. Leakage of contrast material from the ureteropelvic junctions was detected, and review of the repeat CT scan revealed contrast retention in the perirenal retroperitoneum bilaterally. He underwent cystoscopy and bilateral retrograde pyelography, which showed bilateral complete ureteral disruption, preventing placement of ureteral stents. Diagnostic laparotomy revealed complete disruption of the ureteropelvic junctions bilaterally. Double-J ureteral stents were placed bilaterally and ureteropelvic anastomoses were performed. The patient's postoperative progress was satisfactory and he was discharged on the 23 rd day. Conclusion Diagnosis of ureteral injury was delayed, although delayed phase contrast-enhanced CT and abdominal x-rays performed after CT revealed the diagnosis early. Prompt detection and early repair prevented permanent renal damage and the necessity for nephrectomy. </p...|$|E
