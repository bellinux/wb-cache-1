5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather {{like that of}} an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E

Fluent in Cantonese <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> need for translator, Clementi {{introduced}} the first ethnic Chinese, Shouson Chow, into the Executive Council as an unofficial member. Under Clementi's tenure, Kai Tak Airport entered operation as RAF Kai Tak and several aviation clubs. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke {{out when the}} Japanese Empire expanded its territories from northeastern China into the mainland proper. To safeguard Hong Kong as a freeport, Governor Geoffry Northcote declared the Crown Colony as a neutral zone.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E

Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor's Carriage is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot is a melodrama that features Marie Eline in the starring role. The film begins with Max, an old musician who has two daughters, {{one of whom is}} blind. Max becomes ill and dies <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> mother to raise them, the younger daughter cares for her older sister, but they are homeless and poor. The little girl begs a doctor to restore her sister's vision and he proposes to her. The film was released on September 9, 1910 and was met with praise from reviewers. The film saw a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, Britain and Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's research activities in Antarctica were sporadic <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fixed base. This gave the advantage that the research was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In 1989, any party to the Treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need for a permanent base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May, Stjepan Mesić, a Croat, was {{scheduled}} to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial. This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without a head of state <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> commander-in-chief. Two days later, a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed. Ante Marković, prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time, proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers. It was not immediately clear who the panel members would be, apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević, nor who would fill position of JNA commander-in-chief. The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional. The crisis was resolved after a six-week stalemate, and Mesić was elected president — the first non-communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} moving to Diego-Suarez, Jaojoby entered a local talent {{competition}} and managed to win despite singing unaccompanied <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> microphone. He began to perform in nightclubs whenever the opportunity presented itself. The uncle with whom he was lodging sent word of Jaojoby's activities to the young singer's parents, who consulted a priest before giving their son permission to continue exploring his musical talents {{on the condition that}} he continue to perform well at school. Jaojoby agreed to this provision, studying during the day and performing at night for several years. In 1972 he began singing with Los Matadores, the well-established house band of the Saigonais nightclub in Diego-Suarez. This group catered to the club's primarily Western clientele by performing cover songs and rhythm and blues compositions in French and English, occasionally incorporating traditional instruments like kabosy and drums, or experimenting with local musical styles using electric guitar, bass, and drum kit, accompanied by traditional Malagasy language vocal performance.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression saw a {{consistent}} squeeze on Georgia Tech's budget, but World War II-inspired research activity combined with post-World War II enrollment more than {{compensated for the}} school's difficulties. Georgia Tech desegregated peacefully <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> court order in 1961, in contrast to other southern universities. Similarly, it did not experience any protests due to the Vietnam War. The growth of the graduate and research programs combined with diminishing federal support for universities in the 1980s led President John Patrick Crecine to restructure the university in 1988 amid significant controversy. The 1990s were marked by continued expansion of the undergraduate programs and the satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia and Metz, France. In 1996, Georgia Tech {{was the site of}} the athletes' village and a venue for a number of athletic events for the Summer Olympics. Recently, the school has gradually improved its academic rankings and has paid significant attention to modernizing the campus, increasing historically low retention rates, and establishing degree options emphasizing research and international perspectives.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

Heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops were compared for with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>an</b> entrance. The tube was divided into six sections and the heat transferred to each measured separately. Measurements included inlet velocities, heat fluxes, pressure drops and stream and wall temperatures.
