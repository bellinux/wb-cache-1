5|$|Malawi’s first science <b>and</b> <b>technology</b> policy {{dates from}} 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Policy of 2002 envisaged the {{establishment}} of a National Commission for Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> to advise the government and other stakeholders on science and technology-led development. Although the Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> and the National Research Council. The Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Act of 2003 also established a Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> has reviewed the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E

The Second Science <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Policy also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science <b>and</b> <b>technology</b> and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.|$|E

40|$|Machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> {{are the key}} for the {{paradigm}} shift in achieving sustainable agriculture development. The ergonomics design of the machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> {{is very important to}} resolve WMSD problems faced by workers. The study aims to investigate on the pain problems experienced by palm oil workers on their body parts, due to the impact of the usage of machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> as they perform their daily tasks in the palm oil plantation. A survey was conducted using Modified Nordic Questionnaire to investigate and analyse musculoskeletal symptoms among palm oil plantation workers. There were 12 palm oil plantation workers who participated in the survey. The survey results show that all workers who used machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> while working have been experiencing body parts pain disorders, especially at the neck. Body parts pain experienced by these workers has led to an increasing number of palm oil plantation workers who are resisting from using machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies.</b> Practitioner Summary: Machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> would be very helpful tools, if the designers have considered various ergonomic factors at the design stage. This is important because a good and realistic relationship needs to be established between human user and machine. Human workers shall then be able to accept and continue to use the machines <b>and</b> <b>technologies,</b> if it is comfortable and safe to use...|$|R
