40|$|Although {{thirty years}} have elapsed since a {{streptococcus}} was first {{reported in the}} lesions of rheumatic fever, the etiology of this disease still remains in doubt. It is true, of course, that the streptococcus is now looked upon {{by many as the}} exciting agent, but final acceptance of the streptococcal theory is far from being universal. When one seeks for an explanation of this disagreement, the answer is not hard to find. From time to time streptococci have been found both in the blood and in the joints of patients with <b>acute</b> inflammatory <b>rheumatism,</b> but rarely with sufficient frequency to justify the conclusion that they were the cause of the disease. Indeed, several criticisms can fairly be made of previous investigations in this field; the number of cases studied has usually been small; some authors have failed to state the exact percentage of positi+e cultures obtained; and control cultures have not been made on individuals free from rheumatic fever. Triboulet and Coyon (1), in 1897, cultivated a diplococcus from five living eases of rheumatic fever, and at autopsy on one fatal case. Later (1898) they (2) described the production of mitral endocarditis in rabbits by the intravenous injection of a diplococcus isolated from the blood of a patient with rheumatic fever.

40|$|Objective: The {{determination}} {{of the source of}} embolism in patients with lower extremity arterial emboli is a major clinical problem. A review of the literature focusing on large patient series showed that the heart is the embolic source in 78 % of these patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the role of early postoperative echocardiographic investigations in the {{determination of}} embolic origin. Methods: This retrospective study group consisted of 57 patients in whom we performed 63 unilateral and bilateral urgent femoral embolectomies. Bilateral urgent femoral embolectomy was performed in 6 of the 57 patients included in the study and unilateral intervention was performed in the rest. Besides the features regarding age and sex, the cardiac rhythms of the patients during their application to our clinic were evaluated. In order to determine the origin of the acute peripheral arterial occlusion, transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients in the first 24 hours after the embolectomy. Results: In 6 patients who underwent bilateral femoral embolectomy, distinct heart valve pathologies were determined. As for the 51 patients who underwent urgent unilateral femoral embolectomy, it was determined that 28 (55 %) had serious cardiac pathologies. Among these 28 patients, 14 (50 %) underwent the required open-heart surgery interventions after the completion of further examinations. It was determined that, in our series, 14 (64 %) of the 22 patients with serious mitral valve pathologies had a history of <b>acute</b> joint <b>rheumatism.</b> Conclusion: Regardless of whether the interventions are bilateral or unilateral, we believe that echocardiographic investigation should be performed in all patients during the early postoperative period in order to prevent recurrence by the {{determination of the}} thromboemboli source.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of {{theories}} {{try to explain}} the insurgence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with <b>acute</b> articular <b>rheumatism</b> (AAR). These theories remind the close relation between AF and left atrium, or with valvular vitium degree, or monophasic action potential and histological cardiac structure. In 15 years {{of work in the}} academic Department of Heart and Big Vessels in Rome, the Authors studied 243 patients with mitral valvular disease post AAR before and after surgical manoeuvres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were divided in order to monitor atrium and ventricle morphological and functional modifications of the valve according to cardiac rhythm. Patients classification was based on surgical therapy adopted, kind of mitral disease and cardiac rhythm. An histological examination was performed, only in patients treated with valvular replacement. During the operation an histological examination in an atrial tissue fragment was performed. 243 patients with mitral valvular disease post AAR with indication in valvular adjustment were studied. The whole population was treated with mitral transcutaneous valvuloplasty (Group B [...] 130 patients) or with mitral valve replacement surgery (Group A [...] 113 patients). These two groups were divided: in Gr. A in Gr. A 1 and Gr. A 2, and Gr. B in Gr. B 1 and Gr. B 2, according to cardiac rhythm (sinus rhythm iSR, AF). These subgroups were also divided in Gr. A 1 SR, Gr. A 1 AF; Gr. A 2 SR, Gr. A 2 AF; Gr. A 3 SR, Gr. A 3 AF, according to mitralic disease's kind (stenosis, stenosis/regurgitation, regurgitation). A complex screening were exerted to all patients using echocardio-doppler technology. Morphological parameters of atrium and ventricle, and functional parameters of mitral valve, aorta and tricuspid were evaluated. In Gr. A group patients during the operation were execute a bioptic sampling from left atrium and a consecutive histological valuation. RESULTS: In Gr. A 1 mitral valve area (MtVA) arises smaller (p 0. 05). Left atrium volume arises elder in patients in AF than in patients in SR (p< 0. 01), either in patients of subgroups Gr. A 1, Gr. A 2 or in patients of the whole Gr. B before and after valvuloplasty. In the whole population Gr. B, either Gr. BRS or Gr. BFA, left and right atrial volumes decrease eloquently (p< 0. 01) after valvoplasty. There's no linear relationship (Pearson r< 0. 5) between the different subgroups of Gr. A (Gr. A 1, Gr. A 2, Gr. A 3) and those of Gr. B according to mitral valve area (MtVA), volume and left atrial area. Left atrial biopsy shows in patients of SR a normal atrial tissue in the 48 % of cases and lightly altered in remaining 52 %. On the contrary in patients of AF there are strong anomalies in the 100 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: According to histological view, atrial volumes variations and valvular area variations before and after surgical treatment, and according also to their comparisons in different groups, authors could assume that insurgence of AF and its chronicization could be an expression of a strong atrial myocardial histological alteration. Furthermore while starting moment of AF genesis is characterized by histological alterations of atrial myocardium (expression of rheumatic chronic disease), its chronicization hands to anatomic-volumetric progressive deterioration of the atrial dysfunction...|$|R

He further studied Pedro Cieza de León's Crónicas del Perú, the works of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Fernández's Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru. Prescott's progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family traveled to Niagara, which he considered a more healthy environment for her. After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the Conquest, and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell. Prescott's father {{died at the age}} of 82 on December8, which deeply upset him. He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father's estate. His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,736.86, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister. Prescott was elected to the Institut de France in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian. He took the place of Martín Fernández de Navarrete, who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the North American Review were published as Biographical and Critical Miscellanies by Bentley in octavo, and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper & Brothers in New York. Prescott was writing 12pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the Conquest. He used the inheritance from his father to buy a house on Beacon Street in Boston. The building is now a National Historic Landmark, and is also known as the William Hickling Prescott House. Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the Conquest of Peru. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott was also suffering from <b>acute</b> dyspepsia and <b>rheumatism,</b> and he travelled to Nahant to [...] "benefit from the sea-air". This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President James K. Polk. He was also entertained by John Y.

[...] The Conquest of Peru was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper & Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500copies, and the books were sold for $1 each. It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently.
