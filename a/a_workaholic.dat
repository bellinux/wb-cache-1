5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} and is <b>a</b> <b>workaholic</b> and introvert. Adept at using social media, {{he has been}} since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E

50|$|Burke and Fiksenbaum {{refer to}} Schaufeli, Taris, and Bakker (2007) {{when they made}} a {{distinction}} between an individual being <b>a</b> good <b>workaholic</b> and him being <b>a</b> bad <b>workaholic.</b> <b>A</b> good <b>workaholic</b> will score higher on measures of work engagement and <b>a</b> bad <b>workaholic</b> will score higher on measures of burnout. They also suggest why this is - some individuals work because they are satisfied, engaged, and challenged and to prove a point. On the other hand, the opposite kind work hard because they are addicted to work; they see that the occupation makes a contribution to finding an identity and purpose.|$|R

25|$|Dr Kligler {{had arrived}} in Palestine in 1921. He had a vision, {{along with many other}} idealistic Zionists, of Jewish {{self-determination}} in Palestine, and he followed it passionately. Control of malaria was a vital goal, as a failure meant that much of Palestine would have remained uninhabitable, and Zionism would have remained unfulfilled. He was not <b>a</b> <b>workaholic</b> in the conventional sense – he was driven to these activities by a wish to genuinely improve the community, and would undertake any step which he felt would fulfill those ends.|$|E

25|$|A {{brilliant}} {{scholar and}} champion athlete while at university, Bulmer-Thomas wrote biographies {{and worked as}} a sub-editor on The Times during his early life.

He was <b>a</b> <b>workaholic</b> and after leaving politics he became a leading layman in the Church of England; an interest in historic buildings led him to set up the Friends of Friendless Churches group, which campaigned to prevent churches falling into disuse, and {{play a key role in}} founding the charity known today as The Churches Conservation Trust.|$|E

40|$|Several {{theorists have}} noted that the {{conceptualisation}} of workaholism has been neglected in favour {{of the development of}} measures of the construct (Harpaz & Snir, 2003; Burke, 2004 a; Scott, Moore & Miceli, 1997; Robinson, 2001). Typically, workaholism investigations treat the social sphere as peripheral. Consequently, this thesis explored workaholism from a socially contextualised perspective. Various social contexts that were constructed as playing a role in creating workaholism were examined. These included family o f origin, farriily o f procreation, formal educational, work and national cultural contexts. In addition, the construed consequences of excessive working on the social context were investigated. Machlowitz’s (1980) screening tool was employed. Thirty-seven semi-structured interviews were conducted. Employees from the management consultant and financial service sectors were recruited. There were four participant groups, namely, <b>a</b> <b>workaholics</b> group, <b>a</b> former <b>workaholics</b> group, <b>a</b> significant others group and a control group. The <b>workaholics</b> group included <b>a</b> subgroup of <b>Workaholics</b> Anonymous members. Using the Nvivo (Version 2. 0) software package for qualitative research, discourse analysis was applied to the interview transcripts. This thesis found that both external and internal explanations were constructed to account for workaholism. Incisive, previously unexamined explanations also emerged from the data. These included construals o f personal choice and boundaries as well as addiction to excessive activity. Furthermore, contextual issues were assembled as being essential when examining the consequences o f workaholism. Hence, the context was worked up as a significant, but not the only aspect of excessive work patterns. An innovative, comprehensive model integrating these findings was devised...|$|R

500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor".

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>workaholic,</b> Kubrick rarely took a {{vacation}} or left England during the forty {{years before he}} died. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, {{similar to those of}} Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his [...] "reclusiveness" [...] to be myth: [...] "e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people... {{he was one of the}} most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone." [...] Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and had thought London a superior film production center to New York.|$|E
