25|$|Wife and I are come {{to settle}} here. We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{arrived from}} the East {{only a few days}} ago, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{awaiting}} my father, who had some business down the line. Are you going out with the train?" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{filling the}} flat with cattle we took {{on board the}} family of T. S. Hooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in their dwelling, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> taking them up Little River to the hills.|$|E

6000|$|Before the proudest of {{the earth}} [...] We stand with an uplifted brow; Like us, thou wast a toil-worn man, [...] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> noble <b>now!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a yookoohoo," [...] said Polychrome. [...] "Fortunately, {{we managed}} to escape from her castle, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{on our way to}} Glinda the Good to see if she {{possesses}} the power to restore us to our former shapes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the truth}} is," [...] said Turnbull, {{suddenly}} and startlingly, becoming quite grave and precise, [...] "the truth is, the nigger is a Margate nigger, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{on the edge}} of the Isle of Thanet, a few miles from Margate." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{ourselves}} saw {{the play}} yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> discussing it. I am explaining to B. the difficulty I experience in writing {{an account of}} it for my diary. I tell him that I really {{do not know what}} to say about it.|$|E
6000|$|I was not minded to {{continue}} the discussion just at that time, for {{it seemed to me}} we might better bring our mission to a successful end if we held our peace. Water, as one well knows, will carry sound a long distance, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> so near the Charlestown shore that there could have been an hundred Tories or lobster backs hiding within the shadow of the foliage without our being the wiser. It was, therefore, with some petulance, mayhap, that I said: ...|$|R
30|$|With the local/global second {{derivative}} estimate in Theorem  1.1, and {{the boundary}} estimates in (2.22), Lemmas  2.2 <b>and</b> 2.3, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> ready {{to prove the}} global second derivative estimate (1.18) in Theorem  1.2.|$|R
6000|$|Euphemia and I {{had left}} Rudder Grange, {{to spend a}} month or two in Florida, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> on a little sloop-yacht on the bright waters of the Indian River. It must not be {{supposed}} that, because we had a Paying Teller with us, we had set up a floating bank. With this Paying Teller, from a distant State, we had made acquaintance on our first entrance into Florida. He was travelling in what Euphemia called [...] "a group," [...] which consisted of his wife,--the little lady with the note-book,--the contemplative young man on the forward deck, and himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "By my reckoning," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "we {{could not have}} passed more than thirty {{miles to the east}} of them. We have made about eighty miles of westing since we got on our course, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> just on the {{longitude}} of the westermost point of the islands. They are about a hundred miles to the north of us." ...|$|E
60|$|Whether {{the law of}} {{marriage}} be instituted or not, the dictate of nature and virtue {{seems to be an}} early attachment to one woman. Supposing a liberty of changing {{in the case of an}} unfortunate choice, this liberty would not affect population till it arose to a height greatly vicious; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> supposing the existence of a society where vice is scarcely known.|$|E
6000|$|... "AUGUST 29th, March to Budin; that is, southward, {{across the}} Eger, arrive within forty miles of Prag. Austrian Bathyani, summoned hastily {{out of his}} Bavarian posts, to succor in this {{pressing}} emergency, has arrived in these neighborhoods,--some 12,000 regulars under him, preceded by clouds of hussars, whom Ziethen smites a little, by way of handsel;--no other Austrian force to speak of hereabouts; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> between Bathyani and Prag.|$|E
5000|$|John Hume then Social Democratic and Labour Party leader {{told the}} House of Commons, [...] "This raises very {{fundamental}} {{questions as to}} whether the authorities have abandoned the rule of law, <b>and</b> whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> in a war situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome," [...] she said. [...] "And when I saw you {{standing}} on the porch by yourself, {{the idea of being}} generous to old Aunt Patsy came into my mind. <b>And</b> here <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Now,</b> {{what do you want to}} know first?" ...|$|R
40|$|Ontologies are {{considered}} a key technology enabling semantic interoperability and integration of data <b>and</b> processes. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> entering a phase of knowledge system development, in which ontologies are produced in larger numbers and exhibit greater complexity.

6000|$|... "We are out {{of their}} course now, my lad. We passed the {{latitude}} of Cape St. Vincent yesterday evening, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> pretty well {{off the coast of}} Africa. Nine out of ten of the ships we have seen were either bound to the Mediterranean or on their way home. Now that we have passed the mouth of the strait we shall not run across many sail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{bursting}} in the vessel's sides the ice eased off, and she at once {{began to}} settle down. We {{could hear the}} water rushing furiously into the hold. Ten minutes later she was gone! Thus end our hopes of farther discovery, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> left to fight our way in an open boat to the settlements on the south coast of Greenland. We have little time to think. Prompt action must be our watchword now, if we would escape from this world of ice.|$|E
60|$|In the {{preceding}} chapter we closed the minuter narrative with a {{scene at the}} Hut, {{in the spring of}} 1765. We must now advance the time just ten years, opening, anew, in the month of May, 1775. This, it is scarcely necessary to tell the reader, is bringing him at once up to the earliest days of the revolution. The contest which preceded that great event had in fact occurred in the intervening time, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> about to plunge into the current of some of the minor incidents of the struggle itself.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, using [...] <b>and</b> [...] <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> able {{to determine}} {{which of the two}} values of [...] ( [...] or [...] ) works.

50|$|Based on {{the order}} of {{inquiries}} submitted, you have been matched with an interested backer, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> waiting <b>now</b> for legal to finish drafting up the respective documents (hopefully before end of this month). I'll get back to you just as soon as I have them.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is so," [...] {{the earl}} said; [...] "and many of us, {{ascending}} {{the hill in}} front, saw Jerusalem. But even then it was certain that we must again retrace our steps; and when we asked King Richard {{to come to the}} crest of the hill to see the holy city, he refused to do so, saying, 'No; those who are not worthy of conquering Jerusalem should not look at it!' This was but a short time since, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> retracing our steps to Acre, and are treating with Saladin for a peace." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{begin at}} the beginning. Two weeks have elapsed since we crossed 50, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> in 37--the same {{latitude}} as San Francisco, or, to be correct, we are as far south of the equator as San Francisco is north of it. The trouble was precipitated yesterday morning shortly after nine o'clock, and Possum started the {{chain of events that}} culminated in downright mutiny. It was Mr. Mellaire's watch, and he was standing on the bridge, directly under the mizzen-top, giving orders to Sundry Buyers, who, with Arthur Deacon and the Maltese Cockney, was doing rigging work aloft.|$|E
6000|$|Rather wishing {{his modest}} {{adjective}} away, Mr. Lorry replied, [...] "No, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime {{as we are}} all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest." ...|$|E
5000|$|On Russia: [...] "Even in a U.S.-Russia {{relationship}} dominated {{for decades}} by politics <b>and</b> security, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> focused on helping Russia join the World Trade Organization, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> putting a special premium on protecting {{freedom of navigation}} and a rules-based approach to resource development {{in places like the}} South China Sea and the Arctic Ocean." ...|$|R
5000|$|Now, {{the double}} complex [...] {{gives rise to}} two {{spectral}} sequences, horizontal <b>and</b> vertical, which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> going to examine. On the one hand, by definition, ...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} {{arguments}} from Lemma  3.1, Lemma  3.2 <b>and</b> Proposition  3.2, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{in a position}} to formulate a collage theorem for Reich’s iterated function system.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may have}} been a mistake, sir," [...] he said. [...] "But it was not our fault. It was all the munificence of Captain Fraser. He {{requested}} that the highest price and talent on our tariff should be employed to detain you gentlemen. Now the highest payment in our office goes to those who impersonate vicars, as being the most respectable and more of a strain. We are paid five guineas a visit. We have {{had the good fortune to}} satisfy the firm with our work; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> permanently vicars. Before that we had two years as colonels, the next in our scale. Colonels are four guineas." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon after I {{left off}} as above {{we had a}} gale of wind which blew all night. For a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of mine to the saloon, or vice versâ, so heavily did the sea break over the decks. The ship, however, made nothing of it, {{and we were all}} right again by Monday afternoon. Except for a few hours {{yesterday}} (when we had a very light head-wind), the weather has been constantly favourable, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> bowling away at a great rate, with a fresh breeze filling all our sails. We expect to be at Queenstown between midnight and three in the morning.|$|E
60|$|But we have {{exhausted}} {{ourselves in}} the process. We have found great treasures, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> impotent to use them. So we have said: 'What good are these treasures, they are vulgar nothings.' We have said: 'Let us go back from this adventuring, let us enjoy our own flesh, like the Italian.' But our habit of life, our very constitution, prevents our being quite like the Italian. The phallus will never serve us as a Godhead, {{because we do not}} believe in it: no Northern race does. Therefore, either we set ourselves to serve our children, calling them 'the future', or else we turn perverse and destructive, give ourselves joy in the destruction of the flesh.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} MCDM has come of age. It is not {{sufficient}} to continue improving or refining old concepts <b>and</b> paradigms: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> facing diminishing marginal returns. It is time for change.
