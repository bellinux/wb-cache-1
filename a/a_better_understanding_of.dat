These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity {{could be explained by}} assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron.

5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche.

5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists.

5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may {{come into contact with}} carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.

5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E

Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E

By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment.
