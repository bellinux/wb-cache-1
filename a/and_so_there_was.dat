5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 {{at a time when they}} had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the age, {{all that}} {{remained}} of free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a settlement {{at the mouth of the}} River Sirion and another settlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril, which his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from Morgoth. But the Fëanorians had a claim on the Silmaril still <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid against Morgoth.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, {{the school}} {{received}} further County and Government grants. In the inter-war years, numbers of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a Kindergarten and Preparatory Form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, {{the number of}} pupils {{over the age of}} 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire Grammar Schools, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no separate sixth form, although a few pupils did go on to university, some with the aid of County Scholarships.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in {{the summer}} of 1981 Joe Boyd signed the Thompsons to his small Hannibal label, and in November of that year the Thompsons went back into the studio and {{recorded}} a new album. Boyd's proposal, which the Thompsons accepted, was that the album be recorded {{in a matter of days}} so that money could be put aside for a tour of the USA. The resulting Shoot Out the Lights included fresh recordings of six songs that had been recorded during the Rafferty-sponsored sessions and two newer songs. Linda Thompson was several months pregnant when the album was recorded <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no prospect of an immediate release or supporting tour. By the time the album was released Richard and Linda Thompson’s marriage was over.|$|E
25|$|When the 'Dukes' were amalgamated {{with the}} Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards' {{to form the}} Yorkshire Regiment on 6 June 2006. The right to march was finally ended as the award did not give the right, for the freedom to march, to {{be passed on to}} any heirs or successors. The {{majority}} of the Yorkshire Regiment is now composed of soldiers from the north and eastern areas of Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Regiment requested the right to march to be transferred to them. However, the County Borough no longer exists <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no authority to do so. The 'Freedom' given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively that freedom also ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the East and West Riding Regiment. The East and West Riding Regiment ceased to exist on 6 June 2006, having been merged into the Yorkshire Regiment as its 4th Battalion. Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council, as successors to the Huddersfield Borough Council, amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred the 'Freedom' to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.|$|E

25|$|In February 2004, ITV plc {{announced}} plans to close and sell the Lenton Lane production centre in Nottingham with over 350 jobs being axed in the process Following {{the closure of the}} studios, a new news-gathering centre was established in the city, but production and transmission of Central News East moved to the Birmingham studio in Spring 2005. The former studio complex is now part of The University of Nottingham and is known as 'King's Meadow Campus'. It still maintains one Studio (Studio 7), and this is rented out to television and film Companies, generating income for the University. In October 2004, ITV plc closed Central's presentation/transmission department and moved transmission to the Northern Transmission Centre in Leeds. Although there was heavy opposition, the role of presentation and transmission at Birmingham had been significantly reduced after network presentation was centralised to LNN in London in 2002 <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an inevitability that this function would be moved out. CITV (Children's ITV), which had been presented by Central since 1983, was also re-homed to Granada's studios in Manchester, with all content pre-recorded and with out-of vision presentation.|$|E
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} {{refereed}} by Major Francis Marindin of the Royal Engineers, {{who was also}} President of the Football Association. His two umpires were Charles Wollaston of Wanderers and C. Crump of the Birmingham Football Association. According to initial estimates, there were around 10,000 to 12,000 spectators, breaking previous records for attendances in London. This was unexpected, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not enough staff at the stadium to prevent the crowd from rushing through the turnstiles without paying. The weather was described as [...] "bright and seasonable". Queen's won the coin toss and chose to defend the gasometer end. Rovers kicked off, but play quickly turned in the Scottish team's favour and they made the first two attacks. The work of Inglis and Sowerbutts saw Rovers {{take control of the}} match briefly, but Queen's Park were awarded an indirect free kick for handball inside the Blackburn half. The ball was shot straight into the Blackburn net without touching another player, and so no goal was awarded. Rovers quickly gained a corner kick but failed to score.|$|E

500|$|Foster {{created a}} premise {{entitled}} [...] "In Thy Image", {{the basis of}} which was to see Earth threatened {{for the first time}} in Star Trek. Goodwin proposed that this story should be the pilot of Phase II at a meeting with Eisner on August 3. He would later recall that this specific meeting changed the direction of the franchise, as Eisner declared that Foster's story was the one that had been looking for to make a feature, not a television, film. At the same time, Paramount had come to realise that the expected advertising revenues for the Paramount Television Service could not support a fourth network, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no possibility of creating Phase II. By this point, the series had already spent $500,000, and the studio was looking to recoup those expenses in some manner. The initial idea was to continue with the pilot, and then attempt to sell the series to NBC, CBS or ABC. But the Paramount executives were concerned about losing control of a potential franchise, and by moving the pilot into a feature film, it gave them the ability to keep it in-house.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E
500|$|The Ball and Theakston {{series are}} {{considered}} to be when Live & Kicking was at its peak in popularity. After their final series in 1999, it was believed the BBC would replace Live & Kicking with another programme, as its two predecessors had both lasted six years. Instead, they continued with Live & Kicking, with new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson. The series {{was the beginning of the}} end for the show; Ledden and Wilson did not know each other at the start of the series, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> none of the interaction between them, as seen between Ball and Theakston. Additionally, SMTV Live which broadcast opposite on ITV was slowly becoming more popular, and gaining the audience the BBC was losing. After just one series, Ledden and Wilson's contracts were not renewed. Wilson later said that they were dropped just as they were starting to form a relationship, and that Ant & Dec, presenters of SMTV Live, had the edge over them as they had known each other much longer. Ledden had already been dropped when Wilson went through several meetings with the BBC. He decided it was better to leave after one good series, rather than do a second [...] "lame" [...] series, and went on to appear in rival SMTV Live's 100th show, in the Friends skit, 'Chums'. When Live & Kicking returned in October 2000, it was completely revamped, with brand new titles and a line-up of four presenters. However, this did nothing to increase viewing figures, and the chemistry between the presenters was even less apparent. It was decided not to end the show in April and replace it with a summer show, because the replacement FBi had lost even more viewers for the BBC. Live & Kicking continued until September after a move to Glasgow where the summer show had normally been filmed. Just before the move it was announced it would be the final series. The principal reason given for the decision was the increasing loss of viewers to SMTV Live, which had a similar format and was more successful. Live and Kicking was replaced by The Saturday Show, fronted by Dani Behr and Joe Mace, which was shown all year round until September 2003 when it began an Autumn-Spring/Summer loop with Dick and Dom in da Bungalow. Live & Kicking was featured in the BBC's It Started with Swap Shop programme in 2006, where Noel Edmonds interviewed the first pair of presenters, Andi Peters and Emma Forbes, about their time on the show.|$|E

2500|$|But Stevens's {{principal}} objection {{was that}} the Court had crafted {{a new kind of}} severability analysis.

[...] Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no need to adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations. [...] After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. [...] Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their Blakely rights in appropriate situations.|$|E
