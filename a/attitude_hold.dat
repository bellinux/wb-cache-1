50|$|The Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera/Sprint (AERCam/Sprint) is a small, unobtrusive, {{free-flying}} camera {{platform for}} use outside a spacecraft. The free-flyer has a self-contained cold gas propulsion system {{giving it the}} capability to be propelled with a {{6 degrees of freedom}} control system. On board the free-flyer are rate sensors to provide data for an automatic <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> capability. AERCam/Sprint is a spherical vehicle that moves slowly and is covered in a soft cushioning material to prevent damage {{in the event of an}} impact. The design philosophy is to keep the energy low by keeping the velocities and mass low while providing a mechanism to absorb any energy from an impact. The free-flyer platform is controlled from inside the Orbiter by using a small control station. The operator inputs motion commands from a single, Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) device controller. The commands are sent from the control station to the free-flyer via a Radio Frequency (RF) modem link operating in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This research designed and simulated an adaptive {{attitude control system}} for the Crew Equipment/Retriever (CER) during autonomous <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> and large angle or slewing maneuvers. The CER is a proposed space robot that deploys from the Space Station and retrieves any lost equipment or incapacitated astronauts. The moment of inertia tensor for the CER and acquired target is not known a priori. In this research, the moment of inertia tensor is estimated by a Kalman filter and used to update the derived linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and quaternion feedback regulator (QFR) control laws. Computer simulation results show that during <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> the adaptive LQR design stabilizes the CER and provides a more fuel efficient controller effort: as compared with a previously designed nonadaptive minimum time controller and a nonadaptive LQR design.

Statistically significant results were produced by separation velocity. Fuel, time maximum range, time to maximum range, maximum axial range, and final axial velocity increased with separation rate.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for an {{efficient}} control of the aircraft landing and attitude through Dynamic Matrix Control. The idea of MPC structures used in aircraft control has been well established {{during the last few}} years, but some aspects require further investigation. With this in mind, the paper proposes structures for aircraft landing and aircraft attitude control by using single DMC controllers for landing and respectively one DMC controller for each of the attitude axis (pitch <b>attitude</b> <b>hold,</b> bank angle hold and heading hold). The model used for analysis of the aircraft landing structure is based on the last phase of landing. Also, the model used to illustrate the attitude control is that of a pitch <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> system of a N 250 - 100 aircraft. Simulations are performed for a variety of control and prediction horizons, taking into account the possibility of adding a weighting factor for the control actions. Apart from separate studies on step reference variations, for some use cases, a generic reference trajectory is provided as a control purpose of the system. Results show a better performance of the proposed method in terms of control surface transition and protection of the actuators involved and a better time response in stabilizing the aircraft attitude. Overall, the aspects shown ensure an improved aircraft attitude control and landing stabilization...|$|E

Worth Company's E- 7 D short takeoff and vertical land (STOVL) supersonic fighter/attack aircraft design with a modified General Electric F 110 engine which has augmented propulsive lift capability. The system is fully augmented to provide flight path control and velocity control, and rate command <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> for angular axes during the transition and hover operations. In cruise mode, the {{flight control system}} is configured to provide direct thrust command, rate command <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> for pitch and roll axes, and sideslip command with turn coordination. A control selector based on the nonlinear inverse transformation method is designed specifically to be compatible with the propulsion system's physical configuration which has a two dimensional convergent-divergent aft nozzle, a vectorable ventral nozzle, and a thrust augmented ejector. The nonlinear inverse transformation is used to determine the propulsive forces and nozzle deflections, which in combination with the aerodynamic forces and moments (including propulsive induced contributions), and gravitational force, are required to achieve the longitudinal and vertical acceleration commands. The longitudinal control axes are fully decoupled within the propulsion system's performance envelope.
