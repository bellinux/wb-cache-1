5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carrier</b> state.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carrier).</b> Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

Five(83 %) of the 6 HABA patients were positive for anti-HTLV-Ⅰ IgA antibodies, although all 7 ATL patients and 11 of the 14 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> were negative. All HABA and ATL patients and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> were positive for anti-HTLV-Ⅰ IgG antibodies. Four(67 %) of the 6 HABA patients, 2 (29 %) of the 7 ATL patients and 9 (64 %) of the 14 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> were positive for anti-HTLV-Ⅰ IgM antibodies.

2500|$|Dogs become {{infected}} through oral contact with CPV2 in feces, infected soil, or fomites that carry the virus. Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid {{tissue in the}} throat, and then spreads to the bloodstream. From there, the virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, notably those in the lymph nodes, intestinal crypts, and the bone marrow. There is depletion of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and necrosis and destruction of the intestinal crypts. Anaerobic bacteria that normally reside in the intestines can then cross into the bloodstream, {{a process known as}} translocation, with [...] bacteremia leading to sepsis. The most common bacteria involved in severe cases are Clostridium, Campylobacter and Salmonella species. This can lead to a syndrome known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS leads to a range of complications such as hypercoagulability of the blood, endotoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial myocarditis has also been reported secondarily to sepsis. Dogs with CPV are at risk of intussusception, a condition where part of the intestine prolapses into another part. Three to four days following infection, the virus is shed in the feces for up to three weeks, and the dog may remain an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carrier</b> and shed the virus periodically. The virus is usually more deadly if the host is concurrently infested with worms or other intestinal parasites.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the serum concentrations of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies in H. pylori-infected peptic ulcer patients, H. pylori-infected <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> and a healthy control group. Methods: A Total of 100 H. pylori-infected peptic ulcer patients, 65 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> and 30 healthy H. pylori-negative subjects (as a control group) were enrolled into study. Serum samples of participants tested for the levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies by use of ELISA. Results: The mean serum levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies in peptic ulcer group was significantly higher in comparison to the control group (p< 0. 05). Although, the mean serum levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies in the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> group was higher than those in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were observed between peptic ulcer patients and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> groups regarding the mean serum levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies. The mean serum levels of rheumatoid factor in men with peptic ulcer was significantly higher compared to the group of healthy men (p< 0. 05). Although in female of peptic ulcer patients or <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> groups, the mean serum levels of rheumatoid factor was higher than that in healthy women, but the differences were not statistically significant. Also, no significant differences were observed between men and women with peptic ulcer, <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> control groups based on the serum levels of anti-nuclear antibodies. Conclusion: The results showed higher serum levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies in H. pylori-infected patients with peptic ulcer disease which represent the H. pylori-related immune disturbance in these patients. Additional follow-up studies are necessary to clarify the clinical significance of these autoantibodies in patients with H. pylori infection...|$|R

Tax viral protein plays {{a critical role in}} viral pathogenesis. Previous studies suggested that extracellular Tax might involve cytokine-like extracellular effects. We evaluated Tax secretion in 18 h-ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures from 15 HAM/TSP patients and 15 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers.</b> Futhermore, Tax plasma level was evaluated from other 12 HAM/TSP patients and 10 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers.</b> Proviral load and mRNA encoding Tax were quantified by PCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Intracellular Tax in CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) cells occurred in 100 % and 86. 7 % of HAM/TSP patients and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers,</b> respectively. Percentage of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) Tax+, proviral load and mRNA encoding Tax were significantly higher in HAM/TSP patients. Western blot analyses showed higher secretion levels of ubiquitinated Tax in HAM/TSP patients than in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers.</b> In HTLV- 1 -infected subjects, Western blot of plasma Tax showed higher levels in HAM/TSP patients than in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers,</b> whereas no Tax was found in noninfected subjects. Immunoprecipitated plasma Tax resolved on SDS-PAGE gave two major bands of 57 and 48 kDa allowing identification of Tax and Ubiquitin peptides by mass spectrometry. Relative percentage of either CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) Tax+ cells, or Tax protein released from PBMCs, or plasma Tax, correlates neither with tax mRNA nor with proviral load. This fact could be explained by a complex regulation of Tax expression. Tax secreted from PBMCs or present in plasma could potentially become a biomarker to distinguish between HAM/TSP patients and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers.</b> Fondecyt 	 1080396 Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Conicyt) from Chile 	 2409015...|$|R

Nevertheless, it is clear that further interventions will be necessary to meet the international target of a reversal in the incidence of malaria by 2015. This article discusses the prospective role of an innovative malaria control strategy - the community-based treatment of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> of Plasmodium falciparum, with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The potential of this intervention was considered by key scientists in the field at an Advisory Board meeting held in Basel, in April 2009. This article summarizes the discussions that took place among the participants. Presentation of the hypothesis <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> do not seek treatment for their infection and, therefore, constitute a reservoir of parasites and thus a real public-health risk. The systematic identification and treatment of individuals with asymptomatic P. falciparum as part of a surveillance intervention strategy should reduce the parasite reservoir, and if this pool is greatly reduced, it will impact disease transmission. Testing the hypothesis This article considers the populations that could benefit from such a strategy and examines the ethical issues associated with the treatment of apparently healthy individuals, who represent a neglected public health risk. The potential for the treatment of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> to impair the development of protective immunity, resulting in a 'rebound' and age escalation of malaria incidence, is also discussed. For policymakers to consider the treatment of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> with ACT as a new tool in their malaria control programmes, it will be important to demonstrate that such a strategy can produce significant benefits, without having a negative impact on the efficacy of ACT and the health of the target population. Implications of the hypothesis The treatment of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> with ACT is an innovative and essential tool for breaking the cycle of infection in some transmission settings.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} outcome of {{prophylactic}} mastectomy in a hospital-based series of BRCA 1 / 2 gene mutation carriers with and without a history of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A center-based consecutive series of 254 BRCA 1 / 2 gene mutation carriers that had prophylactic mastectomy after a normal surveillance round including breast-magnetic resonance imaging were identified. One hundred forty-seven <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> underwent bilateral mastectomy and 107 symptomatic women had contralateral mastectomy after a mean cancer free interval of 3. 6 years. All removed breasts were histopathologically examined. RESULTS: In one <b>asymptomatic</b> BRCA 2 <b>carrier</b> (0. 7 %) an occult small invasive breast cancer was diagnosed, while in 6 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>carriers</b> (4. 0 % BRCA 1 and 4. 3 % BRCA 2) and in 5 symptomatic carriers (2. 5 % BRCA 1 and 10. 7 % BRCA 2) DCIS was detected at prophylactic mastectomy. No breast cancer occurred in the asymptomatic group after a postprophylactic follow-up period of 778 women-years.
