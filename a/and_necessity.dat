5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May, in {{response}} to Belgian pressure <b>and</b> <b>necessity,</b> the Royal Air Force and the Armée de l'Air undertook several air attacks on the German-held Maastricht and Meuse bridges to prevent German forces flowing into Belgium. 74 sorties had been flown by the Allies since 10 May. On 12 May, eleven out of eighteen French Breguet 693 bombers were shot down. The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force, which included the largest Allied bomber force, was reduced to 72 aircraft out of 135 by 12 May. For the next 24 hours, missions were postponed as the German anti-aircraft and fighter defences were too strong.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of first-order logic. Some {{of these are}} inessential {{in the sense that}} they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols.

25|$|ADC's initial plans {{called for}} some 52 Bomarc {{sites around the}} United States with 120 {{missiles}} each but as defense budgets decreased during the 1950s the number of sites dropped substantially.

However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the United States and two in Canada.|$|E

25|$|In 1736, Franklin {{created the}} Union Fire Company, {{one of the}} first {{volunteer}} firefighting companies in America.

He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the British House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|The perp walk arose {{incidentally}} {{from the}} need to transport a defendant from a police station to court after arrest, and the general prohibition of prior restraint under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Law enforcement agencies often coordinate with the media in scheduling and arranging them. It has been criticized {{as a form of}} public humiliation that violates a defendant's right to privacy and is prejudicial to the presumption of innocence, but is defended as promoting transparency in the criminal justice system. American courts have permitted it {{on the grounds that it}} arises from the limitations <b>and</b> <b>necessity</b> of police procedure, but have also limited it only to those times when it is actually necessary.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{documentation}} of the history <b>and</b> <b>necessity</b> of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn’t {{make much of a}} difference in terms of regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.|$|E

25|$|On November 25, 2014, Washoe County, Nevada District Court Judge Scott Freeman, {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction preventing Uber from operating statewide. The temporary injunction {{was based on}} the company's failure to file a certificate of public convenience <b>and</b> <b>necessity,</b> which is required for every transportation service in Nevada to conform with state regulations. The Government of Nevada also claimed that Uber's screening process was not rigorous enough to protect consumers, and failed to conform with the aforementioned regulations. Uber contested the ruling, arguing that it is an app-based technology company rather than a transportation company, but the company's management made the decision to temporarily shut down its Nevada operations. Nevada legalized TNCs in May 2015.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2006, MP Michel Wolter {{introduced}} a legislative proposition {{to replace the}} current red-white-blue national flag with the red lion ensign. He argued that the current flag was commonly confused {{with that of the}} Netherlands and that the red lion on the other hand was more popular, more aesthetic and of greater historic value. Wolter also claimed he had personally discussed the matter with some three hundred people, most of whom expressed their support for his initiative. On the other hand, many national politicians (including leading members of Wolter's own CSV) and VIPs have expressed astonishment in the local media concerning both the timing <b>and</b> <b>necessity</b> for such a change. The only political party to express support for Wolter's initiative was the nationalist and populist ADR.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, <b>and</b> <b>necessity.</b> Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.|$|E
