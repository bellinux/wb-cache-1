5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a very common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. <b>Also</b> <b>less</b> common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>also</b> <b>less</b> {{challenging}} hikes {{that are}} equally scenic, yet {{better suited for}} families with young children. Popular objectives include Glen Ellis Falls, a waterfall on the Ellis River, and Square Ledge, with an impressive view of Mount Washington for modest effort.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are <b>also</b> <b>less</b> predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
50|$|There were <b>also</b> other <b>less</b> {{frequent}} opinion polls.|$|R

5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were <b>also</b> <b>less</b> enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not profitable.|$|E
5|$|Both stadia had {{approximately}} east-west alignment: the rugby {{ground to}} the north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been much less than Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and <b>also</b> <b>less</b> than the demand for tickets to major events.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed vulture {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed vulture. Its flight is <b>also</b> <b>less</b> steady {{than that of the}} greater yellow-headed vulture. The lesser yellow-headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed vulture.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and <b>also</b> <b>less</b> visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are <b>also</b> <b>less</b> common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>also</b> <b>less</b> action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E

5|$|WASP-15 is a {{magnitude}} 11 star located about 1000 light-years {{away in the}} constellation Hydra. The star, which is more massive, larger, hotter, and more luminous than the Sun, is <b>also</b> <b>less</b> metal-rich than the Sun. WASP-15 has one known planet in its orbit, WASP-15b; the planet is a Hot Jupiter with an anomalously high radius, a phenomenon which {{may be explained by}} the presence of an internal heat source. The star was first observed by the SuperWASP program in 2006; future measurements in 2007 and 2008, as well as follow-up observations and analysis, eventually led to the discovery of WASP-15b using the transit method and Doppler spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by {{at least an hour}} and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was <b>also</b> <b>less</b> than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance difference between the two variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was <b>also</b> <b>less</b> time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E

5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is <b>also</b> <b>less</b> costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E
5|$|In July 1545, the French {{carried out}} a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet. Soon, however, silt began to block the {{entrance}} to the Camber, threatening its use as an anchorage. Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and the authorities in Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the Camber was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was <b>also</b> <b>less</b> strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but <b>also</b> <b>less</b> state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
