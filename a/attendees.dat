In this paper, we present the meshin system, an intelligent personal assistant that organizes messages, notifications and appointments for mobile phone users. To help users prepare for meetings, meshin automatically creates a profile for each meeting <b>attendee.</b> The meshin system searches the Internet with the <b>attendee’s</b> name and the domain of the email address, then retrieves and aggregates information for this <b>attendee.</b> To get {{a better understanding of the}} <b>attendee,</b> it further estimates the personality profile based on the emails he/she wrote. Our experimental results show that our system can predict personality with reasonable accuracies (95 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Ample {{evidence}} attests {{that social}} intention, elicited through gestures explicitly signaling a request of communicative intention, affects the patterning of hand movement kinematics. The current study {{goes beyond the}} effect of social intention and addresses whether the same action of reaching to grasp an object for placing it in an end target position within or without a monitoring <b>attendee’s</b> peripersonal space, can be moulded by pure social factors in general, and by social facilitation in particular. A motion tracking system (Optotrak Certus) was used to record motor acts. We carefully avoided the usage of communicative intention by keeping constant both the visual information and the positional uncertainty of the end target position, while we systematically varied the social status of the <b>attendee</b> (a high, or a low social status) in separated blocks. Only thirty acts performed {{in the presence of}} a different social status <b>attendee,</b> revealed a significant change of kinematic parameterization of hand movement, independently of the <b>attendee's</b> distance. The amplitude of peak velocity reached by the hand during the reach-to-grasp and the lift-to-place phase of the movement was larger in the high rather than in the low social status condition. By contrast, the deceleration time of the reach-to-grasp phase and the maximum grasp aperture was smaller in the high rather than in the low social status condition. These results indicated that the hand movement was faster but less carefully shaped in presence of a high, but not of a low social status <b>attendee.</b> This kinematic patterning suggests that being monitored by a high rather than a low social status <b>attendee</b> might lead participants to experience evaluation apprehension that informs the control of motor execution. Motor execution would rely more on feedforward motor control {{in the presence of a}} high social status human <b>attendee,</b> vs. feedback motor control, in the presence of a low social status <b>attendee...</b>|$|R
