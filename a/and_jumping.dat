5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders <b>and</b> <b>jumping</b> spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E
40|$|The {{market risk}} of returns for BRIC Eurobonds {{has not been}} {{thoroughly}} analyzed via nonparametric estimation methods. The significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> is examined in a monthly sampling frequency. A detailed comparison upon significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> between BRIC Eurobonds is provided. Comparison concerns risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> during the international financial crisis period: February 2007 up to February 2010. Among the BRIC countries, Chinese Eurobonds are the most significant {{in terms of both}} risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps.</b> The most significant estimator is the monthly Yang & Zhang range across the set of BRIC Eurobonds. The shorter the expiry period, the higher is the significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps.</b> This is evident in all BRIC Eurobonds. Risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> estimates are higher for theoretical prices rather than for actual prices according to all risk <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> significance measures...|$|R

5|$|Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, {{which he}} founded in 1988 with his {{daughter}} Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing <b>and</b> <b>jumping</b> capabilities (linking within and across various documents).|$|E

40|$|Significant jumps {{have been}} found in stock prices and stock indexes, which implied that jump risk is part of {{systematic}} risks. Since jump risk is priced, adding jump risk into the traditional finance models has significant empirical and theoretical meanings. Earlier attempts to model <b>and</b> estimate <b>jumps</b> are based on parametric jump-diffusion models. Due to the limitation of parametric models, the literature is rapidly moving towards using nonparametric methods to study various attributes of jumps in stock prices <b>and</b> the associated <b>jump</b> risks. Two nonparametric methods are employed to extract two different types of jump risks in this thesis. The Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006) method tests for large <b>and</b> rare <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> can only be used to estimate the total jump risks. Macinni (2009) method allows for both small jumps with infinite activity <b>and</b> large <b>jumps</b> with finite activity. However, the latter method is computationally intensive and is only used to extract the systematic jump risks by applying it only to the market returns. Jump estimations are computed on 1300 individual stocks <b>and</b> 1 index. <b>Jump</b> risks are found in all 1300 stocks and the index <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risk is a small component of the total risk. SmallCap stocks tend to have higher diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks than MidCap and LargeCap stocks. When SmallCap stocks are used to form portfolio, its diversification gain is higher than that of portfolios formed by MidCap or LargeCap stocks. A portfolio's diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks decrease at a diminishing speed as the number of its constituents increase <b>and</b> its <b>jump</b> risk decreases faster than diffusion risk. However, the uncertainty associated with the diversification gain of jump risk is much higher than that of the diffusion risk. To measure the systematic diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks, CAPM is dichotomised into a two-factor model, two independent factors representing the diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> return processes. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for the 1300 stocks are estimated. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for stocks tend to be statistically different from each other...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-documented}} that stock returns have different sensitivities {{to changes in}} aggregate volatility, however less is known about their sensitivity to market jump risk. By using S&P 500 crash-neutral at-the-money straddle and out-of-money put returns as proxies for aggregate volatility <b>and</b> market <b>jump</b> risk, I document significant differences between volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> loadings of value vs. growth, and small vs. big portfolios. In particular, small (big) and value (growth) portfolios exhibit negative (positive) and significant volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas. I also provide further evidence that both volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risk factors are priced and negative...|$|R

The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running <b>and</b> <b>jumping,</b> but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} Softdisk in 1991 for DOS.

The game features Keen running <b>and</b> <b>jumping</b> through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them.|$|E
5|$|Due to its popularity, Sony {{produced}} two sequels to Jumping Flash!, including one spin-off. A direct sequel, Jumping Flash! 2—also developed by Exact—was released worldwide for the PlayStation the following year; it continued {{the story of}} Robbit and the subsequent {{rise and fall of}} Baron Aloha. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics particularly praising its updated features. Robbit Mon Dieu was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, and was the final instalment in the series. It was met with mixed reviews, and following Exact's merger with SCEI in 2000, the series came to an end. Both Jumping Flash! <b>and</b> <b>Jumping</b> Flash! 2 were re-released via the PlayStation Network in 2007 and 2009, respectively. A loose spin-off titled Pocket MuuMuu was released exclusively in Japan for the PocketStation in 1999 before Exact's closure.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running <b>and</b> <b>jumping,</b> Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E
