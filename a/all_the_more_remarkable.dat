5|$|Orkney has an {{abundance}} of wildlife, especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins, kittiwakes, tysties, ravens, and bonxies. Whales, dolphins, and otters are also seen around the coasts. Inland the Orkney vole, a distinct subspecies of the common vole introduced by Neolithic humans, is an endemic. There are five distinct varieties, found on the islands of Sanday, Westray, Rousay, South Ronaldsay, and the Mainland, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as the species is absent on mainland Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable.</b> Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{biography}} of Juan Antonio Olavarrieta/José Joaquín de Clararrosa, attending to the different facets involved in his life. Among <b>all</b> of them, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> are <b>the</b> roles of journalist and public agitator which give the essential structure of his life. Eventually, identity changes and problems with the Spanish Inquisition blurred his legacy, appearing as a histrionic person to the public opinion...|$|R

5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} {{surfaces}} of constant curvature has a transitive Lie group of symmetries. This group theoretic fact has far-reaching consequences, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{because of the}} central role these special surfaces play in the geometry of surfaces, due to Poincaré's uniformization theorem (see below).|$|E

25|$|Most Austronesian {{languages}} lack a {{long history}} of written attestation, making the feat of reconstructing earlier stages – up to distant Proto-Austronesian – <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable.</b> The oldest inscription in the Cham language, the Đông Yên Châu inscription, dated to the mid-6th century at the latest, is also the first attestation of any Austronesian language.|$|E
25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> for {{a region where}} metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{aerodynamics}} {{also contributed}} to the car's very low drag coefficient of 0.29– quite low even for modern cars. This accomplishment is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> considering the engineers did not enjoy the benefits of computer-aided design or wind tunnel testing. The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.|$|E

25|$|A flood-hit season inflicted serious {{financial}} damage, and on-field {{results in}} the Championship gave little cheer as Worcestershire were relegated. However, in the Pro40 First Division things were very different, and victory over Gloucestershire in mid-September brought the title to New Road, the county's first trophy since 1994. The feat was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{for the fact that}} every one of Worcestershire's games was played away from their New Road home, due to the floods, with 'home' games played at Edgbaston, Taunton and Kidderminster.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Amsterdam was the fourth largest city in Europe, behind Constantinople (about 700,000), London (550,000) and Paris (530,000). This was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of {{government}} of the Dutch Republic, which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as Leiden (about 67,000), Rotterdam (45,000), Haarlem (38,000), and Utrecht (30,000).|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{initially}} {{played a}} Second XI Championship fixture for Sussex in 1981 against the Second XI of Hampshire, but made no further appearances for the Sussex Second XI for some while following that fixture. He did though play club cricket in Brighton, {{while working as}} an insurance underwriter. However, in 1987 he had trials at Sussex, where he again played Second XI cricket for the Sussex Second XI. The trial {{turned out to be}} a success for Clarke, with Sussex signing following which he took a sabbatical from his job. His late start in county cricket, at the age of 26, was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> considering that his bowling style was virtually considered an extinct form in England.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{professional}} cycle racing was stopped after 1915 because of the First World War {{and it was not}} until 1918 that Girardengo took another win, taking the first of his six victories in Milan–San Remo, a record which Eddy Merckx eventually eclipsed over 50 years later. He also finished in the first three of the same race every year from 1917 to 1926 and was first over the Turchino Pass on five occasions. His post 1918 form was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as during the First World War Girardengo had contracted Spanish flu and nearly died, his manager believing a survivor of that disease could not race properly refused at one point to renew his licence.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{half of the}} university's {{students}} {{volunteer in}} community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 Watts Riots, are credited {{for the safety of}} the university during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> in light of the complete destruction of several strip malls in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.) The ZIP code for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, Gleeson {{was named}} {{the winner of the}} Lindsay Gaze Trophy as the Coach of the Year for the 2010/11 season. Gleeson led his Townsville Crocodiles team to an {{impressive}} 17–11 record in 2010/11, which was the second-best win-loss ratio in the league. That is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as a pre-season poll of the NBL coaches didn't even tip the Crocs to finish in the top four. Gleeson inspired his team to the best home record in the NBL, as the Crocs lost just one of their 14 games at 'The Swamp' during the season. That equalled the club's most number of home wins in a regular season ever. He also engineered a Crocs defence that limited opponents to the second lowest number of points of any team in the NBL.|$|E

500|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} lieutenant (between field cornet and commandant), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command. Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late.

500|$|Science Fiction Weekly {{stated in}} 2000 that [...] "few would dispute that Martin's most monumental {{achievement}} {{to date has}} been the groundbreaking A Song of Ice and Fire historical fantasy series", for which reviews have been [...] "orders of magnitude better" [...] than for his previous works, as Martin described to The New Yorker. In 2007, Weird Tales magazine described the series as a [...] "superb fantasy saga" [...] that [...] "raised Martin {{to a whole new}} level of success". Shortly before the release of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Bill Sheehan of The Washington Post was sure that [...] "no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort", and Ethan Sacks of Daily News saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was [...] "rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage". Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:The success is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> because [...] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R. Martin earned his following the hard way, by word of mouth, by hooking his characters into the psyche of his readers to an extent that most writers of fantasy only dream of.Publishers Weekly noted in 2000 that [...] "Martin may not rival Tolkien or Robert Jordan, but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson." [...] After the fourth volume came out in 2005, Time Lev Grossman considered Martin a [...] "major force for evolution in fantasy" [...] and proclaimed him [...] "the American Tolkien", explaining that, although Martin was [...] " [...] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers" [...] at the time and would [...] "never win a Pulitzer or a National Book Award... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today". As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase American Tolkien [...] "has stuck to , as it was meant to", being picked up by the media including The New York Times ("He's much better than that"), the New Yorker, Entertainment Weekly ("an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy"), The Globe and Mail, and USA Today. Time magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and USA Today named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.|$|E
