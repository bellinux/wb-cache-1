30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that successful approaches to more economical production technologies of biosurfactant will be a collaborative approach involving process development and sustainable raw materials supplies. According to Smyth et al. (Smyth et al. 2010 a, b) emphasis should be on cost effective management of downstream processing. The potential to obtain pure biosurfactants is dependent on several complex extraction and purification steps. Use of simple substrates with less downstream processing will economize the process and the use of <b>agricultural</b> <b>substrates</b> and their wastes represents a positive step towards achieving that goal. Some of the prevalent downstream processing process uses solvent extraction (e.g. chloroform-methanol, dichloromethane-methanol, butanol, ethyl acetate, pentane, hexane, acetic acid, ether) or acid precipitation, use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, crystallization, centrifugation, adsorption and foam fractionation (Chen et al. 2008; Kaar et al. 2009; Martins et al. 2006; Mukherjee et al. 2006; Neto et al. 2009). Use of statistical experimental strategies including factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) will help in better optimization of solid state production of biosurfactants. Recently, (Kiran et al. (2010 a) reported the production of a new glycolipid biosurfactant from marine Nocardiopsis lucentensis MSA 04 in solid-state cultivation. More studies are needed on these processes for efficient production of biosurfactants.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} fact in the biogas technology that protein-rich biomass substrates should be avoided due to inevitable process inhibition. Substrate compositions with a low C/N ratio are considered difficult to handle and may lead to process failure, though protein-rich industrial waste products have outstanding biogas generation potential. This common belief has been challenged by using protein-rich substrates, i. e. casein and precipitated pig blood protein in laboratory scale continuously stirred mesophilic fed-batch biogas fermenters. Both substrates proved suitable for sustained biogas production (0. 447 L CH 4 /g protein oDM, i. e. organic total solids) in high yield without any additives, following a period of adaptation of the microbial community. The apparent key limiting factors in the anaerobic degradation of these proteinaceous materials were the accumulation of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide.

In this study, the utilization of agro-based products was taken into account in the enhanced production of exo-PG using an A. sojae mutant by applying statistical design methods. Complex sources (orange peel, wheat bran, and corn meal), simple sugar sources (glucose, maltrin, and sugar beet syrup), and two phosphate salts were screened using D-optimal design method. Orange peel yielded the highest exo-PG activity with all simple sugars and phosphate sources. According to the results of response surface methodology (RSM), the optimum concentrations of orange peel, sugar beet syrup, and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 were found to be 10, 60, and 8 g L - 1, respectively. The exo-PG activity under these conditions was 145. 4 U m L - 1 in shake flask cultures. In bioreactor studies enzyme production was induced at low pH values; thus highest production was obtained under uncontrolled pH conditions, in which the pH dropped to 2. 0 in 72 h.

Compost maturity tests can be classified into physical, chemical, plant, and microbial activity assays.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatially explicit method for making regional {{estimates of the}} potential for biogas production from crop residues and manure, accounting for key technical, biochemical, environmental and economic constraints. Methods for making such estimates are important as biofuels from agricultural residues are receiving increasing policy support from the EU and major biogas producers, such as Germany and Italy, in response to concerns over unintended negative environmental and social impacts of conventional biofuels. This analysis comprises a spatially explicit estimate of crop residue and manure production for the EU at 250 m resolution, and a biogas production model accounting for local constraints such as the sustainable removal of residues, transportation of substrates, and the substrates' biochemical suitability for anaerobic digestion. In our base scenario, the EU biogas production potential from crop residues and manure is about 0. 7 EJ/year, nearly double the current EU production of biogas from <b>agricultural</b> <b>substrates,</b> most of which does not come from residues or manure. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the potential could easily be 50 % higher or lower, depending on the stringency of economic, technical and biochemical constraints. We find that the potential is particularly sensitive to constraints on the substrate mixtures' carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and dry matter concentration. Hence, the potential to produce biogas from crop residues and manure in the EU depends to large extent on the possibility to overcome the challenges associated with these substrates, either by complementing them with suitable co-substrates (e. g. household waste and energy crops), or through further development of biogas technology (e. g. pretreatment of substrates and recirculation of effluent) ...|$|R

The complete sequence of protein was obtained by mass spectrometry analysis. Apparent Km and Vmax values of the xylanase for birchwood xylan were 11. 66 mg/ml and 87. 6 μmol min− 1 mg− 1 respectively. Conclusion: Purified xylanase was analyzed by mass-spectrometry which revealed 2 unique peptides. Xylanase under current study showed significant production using agricultural residues and a broad range of pH stability in the alkaline region. Xylanase produced by Aspergillus fumigatus R 1 could serve as the enzyme of choice in industries...|$|R
30|$|The present study, thus, {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} Se-rich <b>agricultural</b> residues as <b>substrates</b> for cultivation of Se-enriched Pleurotus sajor-kaju (oyster mushrooms) and Volvariella volvacea (paddy straw mushroom) which hitherto has been reported with only exogenous selenium supplementation. Both indicated notable selenium accumulation along with significant antioxidant activities during cultivation on substrates naturally enriched with selenium. These Se-enriched mushrooms, with enhanced antioxidant content, can alternatively be used as effective dietary supplements or neutraceuticals. However, detailed studies need {{to be carried out}} to confirm their properties both in vitro and in vivo condition.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{suitability}} of several chromogenic substrates to detect Alcalase (Novo) and other protease enzymes in sensing devices was evaluated. The {{sensitivity of the}} substrates was evaluated from their A^, values and their stability to spontaneous breakdown was determined over an 8 -h period. ^-Nitrophcnyl trimethylacetate showed reasonable sensitivity but was the least stable of the <b>substrates.</b> The other <b>substrata</b> were based on p-nitroanalide chromophores and were very stable. The substrate which showed the highest sensitivity to Akalase was ^-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-ananyl-p-nitioanilide (£ 3 = 50. 25 /nnol AU" 1 min" 1). This substrate was selected for an 8 -h assay. Esperase (Novo) and Subtilisin Carlsberg were compared with Alcalase with the substrate p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate. A further evaluation of Af-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide was made by incubating this substrate with Alcalase over an 8 -h period. There was a gradual reduction in the rate over the 8 -h period but {{it is suggested that}} the enzyme-substrate reaction is lufficiently stable for incorporation in a sensor for long-term monitoring.
