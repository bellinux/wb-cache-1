40|$|The OpenWSN {{project is}} an {{open-source}} {{implementation of a}} fully standards-based protocol stack for capillary networks, rooted in the new IEEE 802. 15. 4 e Time Synchronized Channel Hopping standard. IEEE 802. 15. 4 e, coupled with Internet-of-Things standards, such as 6 LoWPAN, RPL and CoAP, enables ultra-low power and highly reliable mesh networks which are fully integrated into the Internet. The resulting protocol stack will be cornerstone to the upcoming Machine-to-Machine revolution. This article gives {{an overview of the}} protocol stack, as well key integration details and the platforms and tools developed around it. The pure C OpenWSN stack was ported to four off-the-shelf platforms representative of hardware currently used, from older 16 -bit micro-controller to state-of-the-art 32 -bit Cortex-M architectures. The tools developed around the low-power mesh networks include visualization and debugging software, a simulator to mimic OpenWSN networks on a PC, and the environment needed to connect those networks to the Internet. Experimental results presented in this article include a network where motes operate at an average radio duty cycle well below 0. 1 % and an <b>average</b> <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> of 68 µA on off-the-shelf hardware. These ultra-low power requirements enable a range of applications, with motes perpetually powered by micro-scavenging devices. OpenWSN is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first open-source implementation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 e standard. Copyright c © 2013 John Wiley & Sons...|$|E

30|$|An {{experimental}} method is proposed by Tiwari et al. to empirically determine {{the base and}} the inter-instructions overhead cost. In this {{experimental method}}, several programs containing an infinite loop consisting of several instances of the given instruction or instruction sequences are used. The <b>average</b> <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by the processor core during the execution of this loop is measured by a standard off-the-shelf, dual-slope integrating digital multimeter. Much more accurate measuring environments have been proposed to precisely monitor the instantaneous <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by the processor instead of the <b>average</b> <b>current.</b> One of these approaches has employed a high-performance current mirror based on bipolar junction transistors as current sensing circuit. The power profiler {{in the work of}} Nikolaidis et al. [23] receives as input the trace file of executed assembly instructions, generated by an appropriate processor simulator, and estimates the base and interinstruction energy cost of the executed program taking into account the energy sensitive factors as well as the effect of pipeline stalls and flushes. The main disadvantage of this approach is the current measuring complexity [24].|$|R
40|$|An {{emission}} current control system for balancing the individual {{emission current}}s from {{an array of}} hollow cathodes has current sensors for determining the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by each cathode from a power supply. Each current sensor has an output signal which has a magnitude proportional to the current. The current sensor output signals are averaged, the average value so obtained being applied to a respective controller for controlling the flow of an ion source material through each cathode. Also applied to each controller are the respective sensor output signals for each cathode and a common reference signal. The flow of source material through each hollow cathode is thereby made proportional to the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by that cathode, the <b>average</b> <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> {{by all of the}} cathodes, and the reference signal. Thus, the emission current of each cathode is controlled such that each is made substantially equal to the emission current of each of the other cathodes.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a micro power {{battery state of charge}} monitor. The novelty of this design lies in the extreme low power consumption and accurate prediction of the battery reserve time. The <b>average</b> <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> is successfully limited to 60 µA, which is significantly smaller than those in currently available devices. The proposed design predicts the reserved battery charge with an accuracy of 5 % under different discharge conditions. The automated learning scheme using software is utilized. Protection of the battery against excessive current drain and usage outside the specified temperature range is incorporated. This paper details the proposed technique adopted for power reduction. The battery temperature and current sensing circuits are normally in power down mode, they go into active mode for the microcontroller to take measurements. An ON/OFF ratio of 1 : 153 is achieved which results in power reduction by a factor of 59. 30. The <b>average</b> <b>current</b> requirement of the proposed design is reduced from 3302. 79 µA to 55. 69 µA with the adoption of power reduction approach.

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{reference}} voltage generator {{is an important}} circuitry block in pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The function of the reference generator is to provide accurate {{reference voltage}}s to the ADC which are compared to the unknown input signal in order to convert analog data into digital. To maintain sufficient accuracy, the reference voltage generator often consumes {{a substantial amount of}} area and power in relation to other circuits on the integrated circuit. This project focuses on reducing the power and area required by reference voltage generators used for pipelined ADCs while maintaining the required accuracy. To minimize error in the ADC output, traditional reference voltage generator designs used for pipelined ADCs strive to keep variations in the reference voltages much less than a least-significant bit (LSB). This is accomplished using two different design methods. The first method is to use large bypass capacitors on the reference voltage outputs to minimize the glitches seen in the reference voltages when the residue stage capacitors connect to these outputs. The second method is to design the reference voltage output buffers to have a very low output resistance to prevent errors due to the <b>average</b> <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> from the buffer. Both of these methods require a large amount of silicon area, and the second also requires a substantial amount of power to achieve the low output resistances required. This project proposes a design for the reference voltage generator that can save substantial area and power compared to the previously described traditional design. Rather than minimizing variations in the reference voltages, the proposed design described in this report allows the reference voltages to vary much more as long as they quickly return to their correct values. Analysis shows that this method requires far less area and power than traditional reference voltage generator designs. A second design technique also examined here employs signal-dependent charge cancellation. Through the use of replica residue stages, the charge injected by the residue stages into the reference voltage generator outputs can be made signal independent, thereby eliminating this source of error in the ADC output codes. In combination with the first design improvement, this signal-dependent charge cancellation allows the requirements on the reference voltage generators to be further relaxed, thereby saving even more area and power. This project presents an accurate 8 -bit, 1. 5 -bit/stage pipelined ADC Matlab computer model that has been derived from a pipelined ADC Matlab model previously developed by Professor Perry Heedley. This new model was used to verify the proposed reference voltage generator design, as well as the signal-dependent charge cancellation technique. Analysis of the new reference voltage generator design and the signal-dependent charge cancellation technique was also performed through Spice simulations of a previously designed 8 -bit, 1. 5 -bit/stage pipelined ADC previously designed by a team of graduate students at CSU, Sacramento. The end result was a design for accurate reference voltage generators for pipelined ADCs that have greatly reduced area and power when compared to conventional designs.
