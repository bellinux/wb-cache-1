40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of just-in-time (JIT) <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> in many industries has prompted many companies that still use the economic order quantity (EOQ) <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> to ponder if they should switch to the JIT <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy.</b> Despite existing studies that directly compare the costs between the EOQ and JIT purchasing systems, this decision is, however, still difficult to be made, especially when price discount has to be considered. JIT purchasing {{may not always be}} successful even though plants that adopted JIT operations have experienced or can take advantage of physical space reduction. Hence, the objective {{of this study is to}} expand on a classical EOQ with a price discount model to derive the EOQ–JIT cost indifference point. The objective was tested and achieved through a survey and case study conducted in the ready-mixed concrete industry in Singapore...|$|R

30|$|Since the State Council {{issued the}} house <b>purchase</b> {{restriction}} <b>policy</b> (“Guo Shi Tiao”) in 2010, {{local governments have}} also introduced relevant house <b>purchase</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent housing prices from becoming overheated. Generally, most of the housing <b>purchase</b> restriction <b>policies</b> {{limit the number of}} houses a resident can buy. For those people without hukou, the number of houses they are permitted to purchase is always less than that of local residents. The purchasing procedure is also more complicated and several cities do not allow residents without hukou to buy houses at all. This policy has been successful in supporting the government’s stated goal, i.e., “housing is for living in, not for speculation,” but it creates significant difficulties for migrants without hukou in integrating into their new places of residence.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{research}} indicates that some consumers form price expectations which may impact their purchase behavior. While literature in operations research has built <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models incorporating uncertain price expectations, these models have been built for commodities. Consumers face an environment with multiple brands. In this paper, we develop a model that incorporates consumer preferences and price expectations for multiple brands as determinants of normative consumer purchase behavior. The model demonstrates how commodity <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models recognizing price uncertainty {{can be adapted to}} the study of multi-brand markets. The model is used to analyze the normative impact of changes in price promotion policies and holding costs on individual purchase behavior. It is also used in a Monte-Carlo market simulation that illustrates some scenarios where a post-promotion dip is more or less evident, and provides an explanation for the nonexistent post-promotion dip. price expectations, stockpiling, inventory models, decision making under uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the formation of}} self-enforcing climate agreements, or stable climate coalitions, when all countries {{have the option to}} fight climate change by purchasing (the right to extract) fossil-energy deposits. First, we consider the stand-alone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> and then combine that policy with the option to tax or subsidize the supply of deposits. In either case, coalitions of any size turn out to buy deposits while the non-cooperative countries do not. In case of the standalone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> either no coalition is stable or the grand coalition is the only stable coalition. If the two-instrument policy is implemented, all countries inside and outside the coalition are better off than in case of the stand-alone deposit policy, but the conditions for stable grand coalitions are more favorable under the stand-alone deposit policy than under the two-instrument policy due to weaker free-rider incentives...|$|R
