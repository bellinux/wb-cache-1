40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{offers several}} {{advantages}} over zirconium (Zr) -based alloys {{as a potential}} cladding material for Pressurized Water Reactors: very slow corrosion rate, ability to withstand much higher temperature with little reaction with steam, and more favorable neutron absorption. To evaluate the feasibility of longer fuel cycles and higher power density in SiC clad fuel, a core design study was completed with uranium dioxide fuel and SiC cladding in a standard, Westinghouse 4 -loop PWR. NRC-limited values for hot channel and hot spot values were taken into account as well as acceptable values for the reactivity feedback and control mechanisms and shutdown margin. The Studsvik Core Management System, which consisted of CASMO- 4 E, CMS-Link, and SIMULATE- 3, provided an accurate tool to design the new core loading patterns that would satisfy current nuclear industry standards. Libraries of Westinghouse robust fuel assemblies (RFAs) were modeled in CASMO- 4 E with varying enrichments, burnable poison layouts, and power conditions. Using these assemblies, full core, three-dimensional analyses were performed in SIMULATE- 3 for operating conditions similar to the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station. In this study, SiC-clad fuel rods held 10 % less heavy metal to allow for central holes in the U 0 2 pellets, limiting peak fuel temperature during anticipated operational transients but raising the <b>average</b> <b>enrichment</b> <b>per</b> fuel batch. The cladding dimensions remained similar to the current Zircaloy 4 cladding. Three approaches were followed in creating the PWR core designs: 1) constant core power density (or total reactor power) and cycle length, but fewer fresh assemblies loaded, 2) constant cycle length, but increased core power density to the maximum feasible level, staying within the capability of the reactor etc., and 3) constant power density, but extended fuel cycle length from 18 to 24 months. Sixteen core designs were completed with three different types of burnable poison (IFBA, WABA, and gadolinium) that achieved the desired operating cycle lengths and target values for reactor physics parameters limited by the NRC. Batch average discharge burnups ranged from ~ 41 to ~ 80 MWd/kgU, reinforcing SiC's advantage and potential appeal to power utilities. Additionally, a power uprate of 10 % {{was found to be}} feasible, but beyond this value would require a redesign of the control rod material and/or layout to allow for an acceptable shutdown margin by end of cycle (EOC). Nevertheless, all other reactivity coefficients and safety margins were met, confirming the feasibility of operating to higher burnups beyond the current limits of Zr cladding. by Jacob P. Dobisesky.

Here, we show that midbrain dopamine neurons can be laser-microdissected to a high degree of enrichment and purity. The <b>average</b> <b>enrichment</b> for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression in the microdissected sample relative to midbrain sections was approximately 200 -fold.

Additionally, SN and VTA dopamine neurons had significantly different expression levels of dopamine neuron-specific genes, which likely reflects functional differences between the two cell groups. This study demonstrates that it is possible to laser-microdissect dopamine neurons to a high degree of cell purity.

40|$|The trophic {{position}} of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in spring was determined {{from the analysis}} of the natural abundance of stable nitrogen isotopes in the southern Bay of Biscay between 1998 and 2014. Mesozooplankton (200 - 500 µm) was employed as the reference baseline, as its isotopic signature tracked the seasonal development of phytoplankton blooms. Two methods for estimating trophic position were compared. Scaling the isotopic <b>enrichment</b> <b>per</b> trophic level to the isotopic signature of the reference baseline produced lower trophic position estimates than those using the traditional assumption of a constant <b>enrichment</b> <b>per</b> trophic level. Indeed, the studied sardine population is placed as a mid trophic level consuming prey near the base of the food web. Zonal averages of trophic position increased with decreasing size of the sardine stock and increasing values of the upwelling index, suggesting the interaction of trophic relationships and population dynamics. The effects of changes in the timing of phytoplankton blooms and the release of competition for prey at low population densities were discussed as potential factors causing an increase in mean trophic {{position of}} sardine in recent years. The application of the scaled trophic position estimates to the monitoring of sardine populations will facilitate the comparison of different studies and provide new insights on the factors regulating these populations.

To determine {{the length of time}} spent away from the Bering Sea, growth rate was estimated using the covarying oscillations δ 13 C and δ 15 N, estimated to be 0. 09 mm/day. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in vibrissae from 30 male fur seals showed a minimum of 13 separate periods of stable covariance covering 3. 25 + cm, indicating at least 1 year in warmer, less productive waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The vibrissae isotope ratios were used in conjunction with δ 18 O from tooth dentin growth layer groups of 20 male northern fur seals; they showed significant enrichment in δ 18 O in 50 % of the animals at age 1 - 2 years, which indicates extended periods of time spent in lower latitudes in the North Pacific Ocean as δ 18 O is typically enriched in warmer, less productive waters.
