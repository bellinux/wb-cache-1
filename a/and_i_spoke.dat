5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2008, Beckinsale {{starred in}} Nothing but the Truth as a {{journalist}} who refuses to reveal her source. The film, co‑starring Vera Farmiga and Matt Dillon, {{was inspired by the}} case of Judith Miller. As part of her research for the role, [...] "I spent some time at The L.A. Times with some female reporters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to Judith Miller about her experience....I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played [...] "two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working {{at the top of her}} game." [...] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance. The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy and the film has grossed just $186,702 worldwide. [...] "I have prayed—prayed—for film companies to go bankrupt on films I've made, and then this happens on the one I love," [...] said Beckinsale. [...] "Usually it's the ones you're most embarrassed about that are on the side of every bus." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
5000|$|The {{sentence}} <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{to the boys}}, Sam and Tom {{could mean}} either <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to the boys and Sam <b>and</b> Tom (<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to more than three people) or <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to the boys, who are Sam <b>and</b> Tom (<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to two people); ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well!' said <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> in a queer voice. 'I am very well. There {{is nothing}} {{the matter with}} me. What is her name?' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to {{the boys}}, Sam, and Tom - {{must be the}} boys and Sam <b>and</b> Tom (<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to more than three people).|$|R
2500|$|... "This wasn't {{some sort}} of jailhouse {{confession}} where somebody has gone in and sat in a cell one night and had a brew with another prisoner and somebody has allegedly said something. It's a lot stronger than that. Dupas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> regularly, {{just the two of}} us. This was over months and months that he was talking to me and confiding in me.|$|E
2500|$|Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me {{is owned}} by a company called MK2 in France. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to them {{a couple of months}} ago. [...] I've spoke to them several times about this. [...] I think it will happen, but maybe the {{financial}} crisis is [...] affecting that in some way. I'm not sure what's going on. I'm pretty sure there's seventeen scenes in that at least but it's been a while since we've looked into that.|$|E
2500|$|It was me {{who brought}} Poulidor to Mercier where, like Desbats and me, he spent all his career. In a criterium, I saw this unknown who was riding all around us. I {{saw him again}} in the Bol d'Or <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him. He said he hadn't yet got a team {{but that he was}} in talks. When I got home, I spoke {{straight}} away to Antonin Magne, who asked me: [...] "You're sure that he rides well?" [...] I said I was and he contacted him and took him on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will step}} inside?" [...] <b>I</b> asked awkwardly, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> was {{wondering}} {{how long it would}} be before the earl's excitement broke out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap, indeed! And {{know you}} not this face?" [...] <b>And</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> whipped away my wig and mask, and thrust my countenance close up to his.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll swear I saw it!' replied Monks, trembling. 'It was bending forward when I saw it first; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> it darted away.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|But I, though I saw {{and heard}} these things, refused {{to write for}} a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the {{diversity}} of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [...] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!' ...|$|E
60|$|The time {{to draw a}} breath, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> out for the Cabinet without faltering.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am glad,' <b>I</b> answered; <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> {{thought that}} if he knew {{everything}} he would understand why my eyes glistened, as I am sure they did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] I {{said more}} softly, [...] "it is a Queen's gift, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will keep it," [...] <b>and,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>I</b> saw the curtain shake. Often since that night I have sorrowed over those simple words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} what <b>I</b> had seen, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{she put on her}} bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> exulted, thinking--and then she took off her bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew she would not go away with me.|$|R
60|$|I disregarded his {{interruption}} altogether. I still addressed myself {{only to the}} child, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> as encouragingly as I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, master armourer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> hastily. I {{thought perhaps}} it was for this that you had {{informed}} me of the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all,' said Louis. 'Northwold tea-parties were my earliest, {{most natural}} dissipation; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> for these good people {{for my own}} {{personal}} gratification.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I {{no longer}} could bear her falsehood, for I saw that she but played with me. <b>And</b> so <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> that which was in my heart: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{the burning}} words, I stood close {{up to him}} and tapped his breast as if to drive the epithets into his very heart.|$|R
6000|$|The {{glass was}} dewy, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> wiped {{at it with}} my blanket. [...] "We're {{half an hour or}} so beyond the day," [...] he said. [...] "We must wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother! Mother! My little mother--you're sick, you're really sick, and I didn't know <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> so harshly. Oh, what is it, what is it, mother dear?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{my father}} had been a judge and I had a brother who was a barrister; but the madness was upon me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> quickly and convincingly.|$|E
60|$|There was myself. I {{spoke of}} myself;--of myself, of myself, of myself;--of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up my nose, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of myself.|$|E
6000|$|These are the English lines-- [...] Their outer horns <b>and</b> tusks--whereof <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> [...] Constructed by Lord Wellington of late [...] To {{keep his}} {{foothold}} firm in Portugal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I remember. And she is base {{enough to}} say that I have cut her? I did see her for a moment yesterday, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Him I {{followed}} {{one night}} To this place without light, <b>And,</b> ere <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> heard Him say, word by word, At {{the end of}} his winding, The darkness unminding:- ...|$|R
60|$|Felix <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> not. Disappointment, and {{something}} worse, sealed our speech. DID God look like that--like that stern, angrily frowning {{old man with}} the tossing hair and beard of the wood-cut Cecily held.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{the victim}} of your own obstinate refusal to profit by a plain warning," [...] Bervie rejoined. [...] "At the {{eleventh}} hour, I entreated you, and I entreated Mr. Linwood, to provide for your own safety; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> in vain." ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{morning and}} night I fed that dog, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> as kindly and gently {{to him as}} I knew how. But he seemed to cherish a distaste for me, and always greeted me with a growl. He was an awful dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{every one}} of them," [...] I replied carelessly, believing it was {{possible}} to see them all, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> Harvey Pearson piped up in his shrill voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, [...] "she has absorbed its principles; {{she told}} me as much herself. Sacrifice, for instance," [...] <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> the word my eyes filled with tears.|$|R
60|$|And the action, {{the feel}} of her, her {{suddenly}} uttered cry wrought against all pretense, hurt me as my brutality hurt her, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> what was hard, passionate truth.|$|R
