5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Superscript {{notation}} is also used, {{especially in}} group theory, to indicate conjugation. That is, , where g and h are elements of some group. Although conjugation obeys {{some of the}} same laws as exponentiation, it is not an example of repeated multiplication in <b>any</b> <b>sense.</b> A quandle is an algebraic structure in which these laws of conjugation play a central role.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea, {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was so used to {{living in the city}} that he had lost <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. G.—Yes (but rather reluctantly, I thought). As for Marie Antoinette, {{she was not}} a {{striking}} character in <b>any</b> <b>senses</b> she was horribly frivolous; and, I suppose, we must say she was, what shall I call it—a very considerable flirt? ...|$|R
50|$|A person's {{sense of}} time and space {{disappear}} during a religious ecstasy forsaking <b>any</b> <b>senses</b> or physical cognizance in its duration. Among venerated Catholic saints and mystics, a person's physical stature, human sensory, or perception is completely detached from time and space during an ecstatic experience.|$|R

If he had <b>any</b> <b>senses</b> left, he's miles away by this time. When he was off I went back to Smith's Pocket. I found the hidden opening and saw the gold." ...|$|R
5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{intended}} that Fred would {{manage the}} estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As {{an extension of}} her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

An inflatable bladder which forms {{a portion of the}} secondary seal varies the damping applied to this seal ring. The amplitude of vibration of the primary seal ring is sensed with a proximity probe that is connected to a microprocessor in a control system. The bladder pressure is changed by the control system to mitigate <b>any</b> <b>sensed</b> instability or vibration...|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally {{able to get into}} the story, in part due to the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> {{to say that a}} natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to convene representatives {{of the three major}} movements to formulate a practical solution to this issue. To date, these have failed, though all parties concede the importance of the issue is greater than <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of rivalry among them.|$|E
25|$|Although raised Jewish, Harry Kroto {{stated that}} {{religion}} never made <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> to him. He was a humanist {{who claimed to}} have three religions: Amnesty Internationalism, atheism, and humour. He was a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{analysis}} happens in some metric space; {{the most commonly}} used are the real line, the complex plane, Euclidean space, other vector spaces, and the integers. Examples {{of analysis}} without a metric include measure theory (which describes size rather than distance) and functional analysis (which studies topological vector spaces that need not have <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of distance).|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} to the movement approach to wh-movement and discontinuities in general is feature passing. This approach rejects the notion that movement in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> has occurred. The wh-expression is base generated in its surface position, and instead of movement, information passing (i.e. feature passing) occurs up or down the syntactic hierarchy {{to and from the}} position of the gap.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein argues, in {{his later}} work, that this account of private {{language}} is inconsistent. If {{the idea of a}} private language is inconsistent, then a logical conclusion would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> to talk of private experiences or of private mental states.|$|E

As operational service, we define <b>any</b> <b>sensing</b> capability offered individually by a sensor node or collectively by a WSI. As supporting services, we define functions that support the provisioning of the operational services. The supporting services may be offered by one or more WSIs or it may be hosted outside the WSI by external service providers. Many VSN services may be combined to offer new VSN services (as service mash-ups).|$|R

My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again.|$|E
25|$|Dabo {{is one of}} {{the first}} hip hop artists in Japan. He sprung to the scene in the 1990s and has fame all over Japan. He is the first Japanese artist to be signed to Def Jam Japan. He is also disliked for his style of hip hop, which is said to be {{imitation}} of African American Hip Hop. Many Japanese musicians feel that artists similar to Dabo are just mimicking what they see in American hip hop and is not unique in <b>any</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E
25|$|The year 1910 saw the {{foundation}} of the National Hockey Association (NHA), precursor to the NHL, and Lalonde joined the Montreal Canadiens for their first season. Lalonde scored the first-ever goal for the Montreal Canadiens. Halfway through the season, the Habs traded him to the Renfrew Creamery Kings, for whom Lalonde led the league in scoring. He rejoined the Canadiens for the 1911 season—professional hockey was only then developing <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of teams retaining the rights to their players—during which he had several stick battles and provoked the ire of opposing fans.|$|E
30|$|Coverage and {{connectivity}} {{are ones}} of critical factors to establishing mobile sensor network [2, 3]. The coverage means {{the area in}} which sensing by sensor nodes is possible. The connectivity means how many sensors are connected to cover the entire area for sensing or detecting, and deliver <b>any</b> <b>sensing</b> information to the sink node. The mobile sensor network, established in a given target area where terrain status is unknown, is required to maximize sensing coverage with mobile sensors and maintain the connectivity as much as a network administrator requires.|$|R
40|$|Conformant {{planning}} {{is the task}} of generating plans given uncertainty about the initial state and action effects, and without <b>any</b> <b>sensing</b> capabilities during plan execution. The plan should be successful regardless of which particular initial state we are in. This paper is motivated by the observation that (1) Conformant planning without conditional effects can be handled easily by any forward search planner; (2) To handle conditional effects, one can reason about the set of known facts following each sequence of actions, rather than explicitly enumerating the sets of possible worlds.
