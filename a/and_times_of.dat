5000|$|The word epoch {{was often}} used in a {{different}} way in older astronomical literature, e.g. during the 18th century, in connection with astronomical tables. At that time, it was customary to denote as [...] "epochs", not the standard date <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> origin for time-varying astronomical quantities, but rather the values at that date <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> those time-varying quantities themselves. [...] In accordance with that alternative historical usage, an expression such as 'correcting the epochs' would refer to the adjustment, usually by a small amount, of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard date <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> reference (<b>and</b> not, as might be expected from current usage, to a change from one date <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> reference to a different date <b>and</b> <b>time).</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{influence}} <b>of</b> different forces <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> centrifugation in mini-Percoll techniques with traditional Percoll for sperm selection on motility parameters of ram frozen-thawed sperm. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the reduction of the gradient volume <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> centrifugation, <b>and</b> the increase of its force at Percoll, can be successfully used for ram sperm selection. In conclusion, mini-Percoll may be used instead of traditional Percoll, decreasing costs <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> sperm handling, without motility damages in ram frozen-thawed sperm. 201...|$|R

5|$|Barrymore's {{achievements}} and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, Confessions of an Actor. Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, {{authorized by the}} subject, John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man; Fowler, wrote Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life <b>and</b> <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> John Barrymore (1943); Alpert published The Barrymores (1964); and John Kobler wrote Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 {{that many of these}} earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, The House of Barrymore, and his own study of the actor's work in John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.|$|E

The annual cash award is given on Khan's birthday to a Pakistani author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development, peace, poverty alleviation, or gender discrimination. At the occasion of the award ceremony in 2006, a documentary film about the life <b>and</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> Akhter Hameed Khan was premiered. The film includes archival footage and interviews with family members, colleagues, and contributors and beneficiaries of the Comilla and OPP projects.|$|E
5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain the most from the book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably allegory, to young readers, as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting the life <b>and</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work. This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
