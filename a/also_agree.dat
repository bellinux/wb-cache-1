5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E
5|$|Historians in the 20th and 21st {{century have}} {{conducted}} extensive research on Edward and his reign. Most have concluded {{this was a}} highly significant period in English medieval history, some going further and describing Edward {{as one of the}} great medieval kings, although most <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> that his final years were less successful than his early decades in power. Three major academic narratives of Edward have been produced during this period. Frederick Powicke's volumes, published in 1947 and 1953, forming the standard works on Edward for several decades, and were largely positive in praising the achievements of his reign, and in particular his focus on justice and the law. In 1988, Michael Prestwich produced an authoritative biography of the King, focusing on his political career, still portraying him in sympathetic terms, but highlighting some of the consequences of his failed policies. Marc Morris's biography followed in 2008, drawing out more of the detail of Edward's personality, and generally taking a harsher view of the King's weaknesses and less pleasant characteristics. Considerable academic debate has taken place around the character of Edward's kingship, his political skills, and in particular his management of his earls, and the degree to which this was collaborative or repressive in nature.|$|E

25|$|In general, the Mac Mini {{has been}} praised as a {{relatively}} affordable computer with a solid range of features. However, many <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> that it is relatively costly for a computer aimed at the lower segment of the market. It is possible to buy small computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and more storage. The small size has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, its size and reliability has helped keep resale values high.|$|E

25|$|In the Scandinavian sources, {{consisting}} of Norse sagas, Icelandic poems and Danish chronicles, Hrothgar also {{appears as a}} Danish king of the Scylding dynasty. He remains the son of Healfdene and the elder brother of Halga. Moreover, he is still the uncle of Hroðulf. The Scandinavian sources <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> with Beowulf by making Hrothgar contemporary with the Swedish king Eadgils. These agreements with Beowulf are remarkable considering that these sources were composed from oral tradition 700 to 800 years after the events described, and 300 to 400 years later than Beowulf and Widsith.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{commentary}} {{proposed that}} the chiropractic profession actively regulate itself to combat abuse, fraud, and quackery, which are more prevalent in chiropractic than in other health care professions, violating the social contract between patients and physicians. According to a 2015 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, the perception of chiropractors is generally favourable; two-thirds of American adults agree that chiropractors have their patient's best interest in mind {{and more than half}} <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> that most chiropractors are trustworthy. Less than 10% of US adults disagreed with the statement that chiropractors were trustworthy.|$|E
25|$|Punishments are {{reserved}} {{to the legal}} authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely. It {{has been said that}} these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> and give their confession under oath four times.|$|E

25|$|The commissioner's office {{reviews the}} {{application}} for Gateway Players, verifying {{that the college}} teammate does not have prior St. Louis affiliations; no other options {{to stay in the}} city. Each applicant must <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> to play in a minimum number of games to qualify. If the request is approved, one registration fee is refunded and the two college teammates operate as a package deal. Both must play on the same team, like brothers in a Little League program. If any manager wants to claim one, they receive the other, but it costs the team two recruiting chips. If the Gateway Players go unsigned in the offseason, they will enter the draft, and must be selected in back-to-back rounds.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal and ordinal numbers {{must agree}} in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups {{are treated as}} masculine) with the noun they are describing. If {{there is no such}} noun (e.g. a {{telephone}} number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., shlosha yeladim), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., yeled echad). The number two is special: shnayim (m.) and shtayim (f.) become shney (m.) and shtey (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For ordinal numbers (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.|$|E
25|$|Simulated {{patients}} are often {{recruited from the}} local amateur and professional acting community, through advertisements in local newspapers, or by word of mouth. Actual patients who take an active and self-taught role in their own healthcare may also be recruited. Graduate students in nearby universities may <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> to take up these roles. Patients and medical students working as a SP can be paid upwards of $100/hour for their services. SPs need to draw on their own personal experiences with physicians, conversations with healthcare professionals, talking to specific patient populations etc. They {{also need to be}} trained to accurately and reliably simulate particular clinical scenarios. Frequent quality assessment may be needed to ensure consistency in the portrayal of the patient role; especially since SPs may absorb a significant amount of clinical knowledge from their interactions with healthcare professionals.|$|E

25|$|Only a year later, {{the family}} was {{overtaken}} by a greater scandal. Elizabeth's younger daughter, Anne, and her only living son, George, were executed on charges of treason, adultery, and incest. Anne's two chief biographers, Eric Ives and Retha Warnicke, both concluded that these charges were fabricated. They <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> that the King wanted to marry Jane Seymour. Beyond this obvious fact, {{the sequence of events}} is unclear and historians are divided about whether the key motivation for Anne's downfall was her husband's hatred of her or her political ambitions. Despite the claims of several recent novels, academic historians agree that Anne was innocent and faithful to her husband. Nonetheless, the judges obeyed the King, condemning Anne, George Boleyn and four others to death. Elizabeth's husband Thomas Boleyn and brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk provided no help to the condemned. The accused men were beheaded by the axe on 17 May 1536 and Anne was executed by a French swordsman two days later.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games, and Hodges writing for a Western {{audience}} encourages players to do so.) Players can <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> to a draw at any time, {{or if the}} game reaches a position such that the winning condition is impossible to fulfill for either player (called 持将棋 jishōgi, as in standard shogi). (In practice, positions that cannot be won without the other side making a very obvious blunder are also considered as jishōgi, such as a king with only his lion blocked from getting near the enemy king by two side movers on adjacent ranks.) Under the historical rules, this means that no legal series of moves can lead to all of one player's royal pieces being captured; under the Japanese Chu Shogi Association's rules, this additionally means that no legal series of moves can lead to one player being left with only a king, or with no royal pieces. In professional play, drawn games are replayed with opposite colours.|$|E
