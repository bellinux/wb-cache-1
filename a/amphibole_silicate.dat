50|$|Actinolite is an <b>amphibole</b> <b>silicate</b> mineral {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula Ca2(Mg4.5-2.5Fe2+0.5-2.5)Si8O22(OH)2.|$|E
50|$|Tremolite is {{a member}} of the <b>amphibole</b> group of <b>silicate</b> {{minerals}} with composition: ☐Ca2(Mg5.0-4.5Fe2+0.0-0.5)Si8O22(OH)2. Tremolite forms by metamorphism of sediments rich in dolomite and quartz. Tremolite forms a series with actinolite and ferro-actinolite. Pure magnesium tremolite is creamy white, but the color grades to dark green with increasing iron content. It has a hardness on Mohs scale of 5 to 6. Nephrite, one of the two minerals of the gemstone jade, is a green variety of tremolite.|$|R
50|$|Riebeckite is a sodium-rich {{member of}} the <b>amphibole</b> group of <b>silicate</b> minerals, {{chemical}} formula Na2(Fe2+3Fe3+2)Si8O22(OH)2. It forms a solid solution series with magnesioriebeckite. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system, usually as long prismatic crystals showing a diamond-shaped cross section, but also in fibrous, bladed, acicular, columnar, and radiating forms. Its Mohs hardness is 5.0-6.0, and its specific gravity is 3.0-3.4. Cleavage is perfect, two directions {{in the shape of}} a diamond; fracture is uneven, splintery. It is often translucent to nearly opaque.|$|R
25|$|Minerals {{with many}} {{cleavages}} might not break equally well {{in all of}} the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three direction, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the <b>amphiboles</b> are double-chain <b>silicates</b> and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.|$|R
40|$|The Los Santos skarn shows several {{chemical}} and mineralogical features common {{to many other}} W-bearing calcic mesozonal reduced skarn deposits. Early exoskarn consists of hedenbergite (Hd 82 - 87), grossular (Grs 53 - 73) and Mo-rich scheelite. The mineral assemblage which formed during the cooling {{of the system is}} very complex and is constituted mainly by subcalcic garnet, other hydrated <b>silicates</b> (<b>amphibole,</b> phlogopite, prehnite, epidote-clinozoisite, chlorite, white mica and zeolite) and metallic mineralization with Mo-poor scheelite. The aplitic granite is replaced by a calcic plagioclase and clinopyroxene endoskarn. Stockscheider, breccias and fractures indicate a forceful emplacement and over pressure associated with volatile exsolution from granite magma. The occurrence of zeolites indicates that the hydrothermal fluid circulation probably communicated with the surface as in present-day geothermal system...|$|R
40|$|Recent sediments with {{distinct}} {{signs of}} hydrothermal alteration sampled in the Hess Deep(Galapagos Ridge, East Pacific Rise) contained {{a piece of}} ash-gray rock, which differed from other rock fragments by degree of consolidation, conchoidal fracture, and had properties of asbestos. Our studies found that the sample represented mixture of asbestos-like pyroxene of diopside-hedenbergite composition, amphibole of tremolite composition and a new mineral, which basic structure consisted of bands of triple pyroxene chains with the radical [Si 6 O 16]. The latter {{can be regarded as}} intermediate between <b>amphiboles</b> and layered <b>silicates.</b> Also {{in some parts of the}} sample presence of trioctahedral vermiculite-chlorite was indicated. Genesis of the studied asbestos rock is considered from the standpoint of high-temperature hydrothermal-metasomatic alteration of sediment by post-magmatic mineralized halide solutions...|$|R
30|$|Empirical {{equations}} {{have been}} proposed to quantitatively relate the physical and chemical conditions of a silicate melt in equilibrium with calcic amphibole (including T, P, and SiO_ 2 ^melt) with the single-phase composition of amphibole (Ridolfi et al. 2010; Ridolfi and Renzulli 2012; Putirka 2016). The empirical equations were formulated based on high-P–T equilibrium experiments using natural volcanic rocks as starting materials. In the present study, the P–T–SiO_ 2 ^melt conditions of silicate melts in equilibrium with amphiboles were estimated using the empirical equations based on amphibole composition. These conditions can be estimated using these equations without assuming equilibrium between amphibole and other phases, which enables us to recognize disequilibrium between these phases. Although several geothermobarometers {{have been proposed}} based on element partitioning between amphibole and plagioclase (e.g., Blundy and Holland 1990; Holland and Blundy 1994; Molina et al. 2015) and between <b>amphibole</b> and <b>silicate</b> melt (e.g., Putirka 2016), they all require the assumption of equilibrium between amphibole and other phases. These models therefore have increased errors associated with P–T estimates if amphibole and other phases are in disequilibrium. Therefore, we calculated the P–T–SiO_ 2 ^melt conditions of silicate melts in equilibrium with amphiboles using the empirical equations based on amphibole composition.|$|R
40|$|Micropods, {{irregular}} {{bodies and}} schlieren of chromitite occur within {{a unit of}} layered plagioclase-bearing wehrlite on Ouen Island, southern New Caledonia. The primary chromian spinel is Al-rich, with Cr# [atomic (Cr/Cr + Al) ] between 0. 52 and 0. 62, and Mg# [Mg/(Mg + Fe²⁺) ] between 0. 57 and 0. 72. Contents of minor and trace elements (Ga, Ni, Zn, Co, Mn, V, Sc) in primary spinel, obtained by LA–ICP–MS, are comparable to those reported in chromian spinel from podiform chromitites in other ophiolite complexes. The chromitites are strongly enriched in Pt and Pd (up to 11. 5 ppm Pt + Pd), reflecting the presence of abundant platinum-group minerals (PGM), including alloys, sulfides, oxides and compounds containing Te, Sb or Hg. Also present are Ru–(Os–Ir) phases, in accessory amounts: sulfides (mainly laurite, two unidentified Os–S and Ir–S compounds) and sulfarsenides of Ir and Rh. Abundant base-metal minerals (BMM) occur together with the PGM; they include Ni–Cu–Fe sulfides (pentlandite, millerite, heazlewoodite, chalcopyrite and bornite), awaruite (Ni₃Fe), and a phase with a composition close to NiAsS (probably gersdorffite). The geochemistry and mineralogy of the chromitite and the PGE mineralization show that the Ouen Island chromitites have a different origin than {{those found in the}} mantle and crust sequences of the New Caledonia ophiolite complex. The distribution, morphology and composition of the PGM and BMM in the chromitites define two distinct paragenetic assemblages: i) primary or magmatic, consisting of PGM and BMS grains enclosed in the unaltered core of chromian spinel grains and in primary anhydrous silicates (olivine and pyroxene) of the matrix; ii) secondary or postmagmatic, consisting of PGM and BMM grains found along fractures, enclosed or in contact with high-temperature secondary hydrous <b>silicates</b> (<b>amphibole)</b> and low-temperature <b>silicates</b> (serpentine, chlorite). Microtextural and compositional data for the secondary PGM and BMM mineral assemblages suggest that after the crystallization of chromian spinel, an excess of H₂O generated a residual high-temperature hydrothermal fluid that modified the magmatic PGM mineralogy, producing small-scale remobilization of the PGE. Late serpentinization overprinted this hydrothermal alteration, and contributed to the degradation of the primary PGM and BMM. At this stage, PGE-bearing alloys and sulfides were replaced by new stable alloys and oxides of the PGE. 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIsland arc picrites and boninites are {{magnesian}} {{magmatic rocks}} {{believed to be}} generated by high degrees of melting of depleted mantle sources fluxed by subduction-derived, volatile-rich components. These magmas can be probes of both the mantle wedge protoliths and subduction components, but are rare among other, usually more evolved, types of arc lavas. Furthermore, many arc picrites and boninites show evidence for late-stage differentiation prior to or during eruption, masking their primary, mantle-derived geochemical signatures. We report textural and chemical data on spinel-hosted melt inclusions of mantle origin in amphibole-bearing websterite veins cross-cutting spinel harzburgite xenoliths from the active andesitic Avacha volcano (south Kamchatka, Russia). The data are used to constrain the composition and origin of melts that formed the websterite veins in the sub-arc lithospheric mantle. The melt inclusions typically contain euhedral orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene and occasionally minor <b>amphibole</b> in <b>silicate</b> glass. The melt inclusions were homogenized using heating stages and gas-mixing furnaces. The homogenized glasses range from subalkaline primitive silica-rich picrite and high-Ca boninite (> 15 [*]wt % MgO, 48 – 54 [*]wt % SiO 2) to rhyolite. High-Ca boninite glasses have moderate volatile and low {{heavy rare earth element}} contents and elevated Cs, Rb, Ba, U, Sr, and Li abundances, with extremely high U/Th. In turn, the glasses display no negative spikes in the high field strength elements Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and Ti. We show that the silica-rich picrite and high-Ca boninite liquids in this study formed by high degrees of melting (> 25 %), at volatile under-saturation, of hybrid melt-depleted but silica-rich mantle sources at ≥ 1 · 5 [*]GPa. The hybrid sources formed in two stages: first, by extraction of ∼ 15 % melt from the convecting mantle to form a refractory protolith, which was subsequently enriched in silica via interaction with subduction-derived components prior to or during remelting in the mantle wedge. The subduction-derived components were enriched in fluid-mobile elements and probably oxidized. Overall, our results suggest that silica-rich picrites and high-Ca boninites can be primary melts in mature subduction zones and differentiate within the mantle wedge and the deep arc crust to form more evolved andesite magmas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRationale: We {{have used}} ahigh–precision, high {{efficiency}} method for themeasurementof the 2 H/ 1 H ratios of hydrous <b>silicates</b> (<b>amphiboles)</b> and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAM) such as clinopyroxene, garnet and diamond, {{which are usually}} extremely resistant to pyrolysis. This opens up new fields of investigation {{to better understand the}} conditionsof formation fordeep-Earth minerals. Method: The technique described hereinvolvesIsotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) online in continuous flow mode with an Elemental Analyzer (EA) using“purge and trap” technology rather than conventional packed column-GC gas separation. The system is equipped with a special high temperature furnace reaching 1500 °C, with a longer hot zone and improved temperature stability. Emphasis is put on the efficiency of the system to reliably pyrolyserefractory minerals difficult to analyse with other conventional systems. Results: While conventional systems usually fail to generate hydrogen suitable for isotopic analyses, with the technique presented here we were able to measure 2 H/ 1 H ratios from 4 diamond samples (δ 2 H= - 60, - 77, - 84 and - 79 ‰ V-SMOW; average SD = 4. 5 ‰; n= 2), 3 garnet samples (δ 2 Hfrom - 70 to - 63 ‰), and 9 clinopyroxenes (δ 2 H from - 92 to - 58 ‰) associated with 7 amphiboles (δ 2 Hfrom - 76 to - 27 ‰) from single mantle rock. Conclusions: The possibility of using such a system to reliably measure 2 H/ 1 H ratios from refractory minerals, which are usually extremely difficult to analyse, offers a new tool of investigation for giving us unrivaled clues to study the Earth's deep interiors...|$|R
40|$|This review substantiates kinetically and pathologically the diVerences between {{chrysotile}} and amphiboles. The serpentine chrysotile is a {{thin walled}} sheet <b>silicate</b> while the <b>amphiboles</b> are double-chain <b>silicates.</b> These diVerent chemistries result in chrysotile clearing very rapidly from the lung (T 1 / 2 D 0. 3 to 11 days) while amphiboles are among the slowest clearing Wbers known (T 1 / 2 D 500 days to 1). Across the range of mineral Wber solubilities chrysotile lies towards the soluble end of the scale. Chronic inhalation toxicity studies with chryso-tile in animals have unfortunately been performed at very high exposure concentrations resulting in lung overload. Consequently their relevance to human exposures is extremely limited. Chrysotile following subchronic inhalation at a mean exposure of 76 Wbers L> 20 m/ cm 3 (3413 total Wbers/cm 3) resulted in no Wbrosis (Wagner score 1. 8 – 2. 6), at any time point and no diVerence with controls in BrdU response or biochemical and cellular parameters. The long chrysotile Wbers were observed to break apart into small particles and smaller Wbers. Toxicologically, chrysotile which rapidly falls apart in the lung behaves more like non-Wbrous mineral dusts while response to amphibole asbestos reXects its insoluble Wbrous structure. Recent quantitative reviews of epidemiological studies of mineral Wbers have determined the potency of chrysotile and amphibole asbestos for causing lung cancer and mesothelioma in relation to Wber type have also diVerentiated between these two minerals. The most recent analyses also concluded {{that it is the}} longer, thinner Wbers that have the great-est potency as has been reported in animal inhalation toxicology studies. However, one of the major diYculties in interpreting these stud-ies is that the original exposure estimates rarely diVerentiated between chrysotile and amphiboles.

40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} mafic silicates from the Amba Dongar carbonatitic-alkaline complex, Gujarat, India and the Strange Lake peralkaline granitic complex, Quebec-Labrador, Canada {{are the subject of}} this investigation of their origin, evolution and relationship to mineralization. Primary minerals are transformed by a variety of processes related to their crystallization history. The most important of these processes are: magma evolution, magma degassing and metasomatism. These processes are commonly associated with the evolution of peralkaline granitic and carbonatitic-alkaline complexes, and with the formation of associated mineral deposits (e. g., fluorite in the Amba Dongar complex; Zr-, REE- (rare-earth elements), Be-, Nb-and Y-rich deposit in the Strange Lake complex). Although all minerals in these complexes may be subject to these changes, the mafic <b>silicates</b> <b>amphibole,</b> pyroxene and mica are of particular interest, as they remain poorly studied and may comprise up to 10 vol. % of the rock. Moreover, they can contain significant quantities of high field-strength elements (HFSE), which may be mobilized following interaction with later fluids, and deposited as secondary minerals in the ore zone. In the Amba Dongar complex, Na-metasomatism followed by K- (or Mg-) metasomatism resulted in the formation of fenites, with mobilization of HFSE, among other trace elements. Vermiculite was formed by a subsequent stage of hydrothermal alteration, which is also responsible for formation of the fluorite deposit. In the Strange Lake complex, enrichment of the primary arfvedsonitic amphibole in HFSE and REE is related to magmatic evolution, whereas later degassing released sufficient amounts of volatiles and Na that the amphibole became more potassic and aegirine crystallized. This amphibole acted as a sink for trace elements such as Li, HFSE and REE. These elements were remobilized during Na-metasomatism through replacement of amphibole by aegirine, and deposited as secondary, generally Ca-rich, minerals (e. g., winchitic amphibole and biopyriboles) during later, lower-temperature Ca-metasomatism. Primary mafic silicates in alkaline complexes can thus undergo metasomatic reactions that result in the mobilization of elements that contribute to formation of related ore deposits. These findings concerning the solid phases involved in both localities correlate very well with indications of mixing of two distinct fluid phases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLi {{behaviour}} {{and distribution}} in the mantle were investigated by ion microprobe in situ measurements on co-existing olivine (ol), orthopyroxene (opx), clinopyroxene (cpx) and amphibole (amp) in xenoliths from the French Massif Central. The fertile spinel lherzolites of this study record increasing degrees of mantle metasomatism, from unmetasomatised anhydrous samples through cryptically metasomatised samples to highly metasomatised amphibole-rich samples. In anhydrous lherzolites, Li is preferentially incorporated into olivine (1. 1 - 1. 4 ppm, average values) compared to pyroxenes (0. 2 - 0. 9 ppm). The hydrous samples clearly show enrichment of Li in ol (1. 5 - 5. 0 ppm), opx (1. 1 - 2. 4 ppm) and cpx (2. 4 - 5. 4 ppm), while amphibole incorporates less Li than the co-existing phases (0. 8 - 1. 3 ppm). Average δ 7 Li values range from + 7. 6 to + 14. 5 ‰ in ol, from 5. 1 to + 13. 7 ‰ in opx and from 8. 8 to + 10. 3 ‰ in cpx from the anhydrous lherzolites. A layered peridotite sample (Sdi) shows higher Li content in all phases, with lighter isotopic composition in opx and cpx (− 0. 6 and − 2 ‰ average δ 7 Li values, respectively). In the hydrous lherzolites average δ 7 Li values both overlap and extend beyond these ranges in ol (up to 17. 5 ‰) and in opx (up to 22. 9 ‰), and vary widely in cpx (− 2. 7 to + 9. 7 ‰). Low δ 7 Li values are observed in some opx (− 10. 4 ‰) and cpx (− 13 ‰) from sample Sdi, and in cpx from three hydrous samples (from − 9. 7 to − 5. 3 ‰). The different anhydrous phases from the hydrous samples show large intra-grain variations in Li isotopic ratios (e. g., up to 18 ‰) compared to the same phases from the anhydrous samples (mostly less than 6 ‰), excepting sample Sdi which has up to 20. 4 ‰ variation in cpx. Similar to the anhydrous <b>silicates,</b> <b>amphiboles</b> show a wide variation of δ 7 Li values on the intra-grain scale (2 - 27 ‰). These variations are interpreted to result from fractionation processes during metasomatism by a silicate melt undergoing compositional changes as it percolates through and reacts with the peridotite phases. Thus Li abundances and isotopic in situ measurements are useful for tracing metasomatic processes but the heterogeneities observed in the samples preclude any identification of a specific mantle source by its Li signature...|$|R
