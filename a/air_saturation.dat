40|$|This work {{successfully}} {{applied the}} gas-phase partitioning tracer method {{to determine the}} NAPL, water and <b>air</b> <b>saturations</b> in the vadose zone at the field scale. This project {{was one of the}} first, and still one of the few, field-scale gas-phase partitioning tracer tests. This work differs from other work in that it was conducted in a high water content, fractured clay. There were three primary components of this work. First, gas-phase tracers were identified and their NAPL-air and Henry's Law constants measured. There were four types of tracers used in this study: noble gases or nonpartitioning tracers; alkanes, which were expected to be nonpartitioning tracers; perfluorides, NAPL partitioning tracers; and halons, NAPL and water partitioning tracers. A laboratory method for measuring NAPL-air partition coefficients was developed and TCE-air partition coefficients were measured for the perfluoride and halon tracers. The second component of this study involved conducting a field-scale gas-phase partitioning tracer test, the results which were used to estimate NAPL, water and <b>air</b> <b>saturations.</b> The NAPL saturation, calculated to be an extremely low value, resulted in an estimate of NAPL mass present that is similar to the amount that has subsequently been extracted from the test site via SVE remediation. The alkane tracers, which had been used previously in laboratory column studies as nonpartitioning tracers, were more retarded than the perfluoride tracers at this site. It was the alkane tracers, and not the halon tracers, that were used to determine the water content. The water content was estimated to be approximately 90 %, which is unexpectedly high for a vadose zone. Additionally, the tracer response time, vacuum data, and other geological data indicated that the tracer test was performed in fractured clay. The third component of this work comprised an analysis of the tracer test data to determine transport parameters. The analysis employed matching eight simple mathematical models to the experimental data. All of the models tested: two porous, three double-porosity, and three fracture-based (single fracture, multifracture, fracture-matrix) models could reasonably match the experimental data and no one model resulted in consistently superior predictions than the others...|$|R

50|$|Super{{saturation}} {{of oxygen}} (i.e. saturation levels above 100%) can occur naturally. The {{most common cause}} is oxygen production by photosynthetically active species such as plants and algae. According to Henry's law, the equilibrium oxygen concentration {{is proportional to the}} partial pressure of oxygen gas. As air contains about 21% oxygen the equilibrium concentration of pure oxygen gas corresponds to nearly 500% <b>air</b> <b>saturation.</b> The other reason is that the oxygen concentration can be slow to adjust to changes in the environment. A rapid increase in temperature can reduce the equilibrium concentration of oxygen to a value below the actual concentration in the water, giving raise to more than 100% saturation until the system has had time to equilibrate through diffusion. Supersaturation can sometimes be harmful for organisms and cause decompression sickness.|$|E

50|$|Louis Lliboutry {{noted that}} the key climatic {{condition}} for the differential ablation {{that leads to the}} formation of penitentes is that the dew point is always below freezing. Thus, snow will sublimate. Once the process of differential ablation starts, the surface geometry of the evolving penitente produces a positive feedback mechanism, and radiation is trapped by multiple reflections between the walls. The hollows become almost a black body for radiation, while decreased wind leads to <b>air</b> <b>saturation,</b> increasing dew point temperature and the onset of melting. In this way peaks, where mass loss is due only to sublimation, will remain, as well as the steep walls, which intercept only a minimum of solar radiation. In the troughs, the ablation is enhanced, leading to a downward growth of penitentes. A mathematical model of the process has been developed by Betterton, although the physical processes at the initial stage of penitente growth, from granular snow to micropenitentes, still remain unclear. The effect of penitentes on the energy balance of the snow surface, and therefore their effect on snow melt and water resources has also been studied.|$|E

Coculturing of N. europaea with the nitrite oxidizer Nitrobacter winogradskyi strongly reduced the relative levels of NO and N(inf 2) O production, probably as an effect of the lowered nitrite concentration. After lowering the aeration, N. europaea produced large short-lasting peaks of NO and N(inf 2) O emissions in the presence but not in the absence of nitrite.

40|$|Hypoxia is {{a global}} and {{increasingly}} important stressor in aquatic ecosystems, with major impacts on biodiversity worldwide. Hypoxic waters are often contaminated {{with a wide range}} of chemicals but knowledge is limited about the interactions between hypoxia and chemical stressors. Therefore, during this PhD I set out to investigate how the concentration of oxygen in the water influences chemical toxicity in fish. My work focused on two groups of chemicals: toxic metals, of which copper was used as an example, and anti-androgenic chemicals. Copper is an essential metal, widespread in the aquatic environment, but it can become toxic to aquatic organisms when environmental levels become too high. Copper and hypoxia are likely to co-occur but despite this our understanding of the interactions between these two stressors is limited. To address this, I performed a series of experiments using both the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as fish models. I first investigated the effects of hypoxia on copper toxicity to zebrafish embryos during development. Copper toxicity was reduced by over 2 -fold under hypoxia compared to normoxia during the first day of development, and I demonstrated that this protective effect was associated with the activation of the hypoxia inducible factor pathway. In contrast, hypoxia increased copper toxicity in hatched larvae, which was deduced to be associated with differential copper uptake. To test if the interactions between copper and low oxygen observed for the zebrafish also occurred for other fish species, exposures were conducted in a species with a lower tolerance to hypoxia, the three-spined stickleback. The results obtained showed that hypoxia suppressed copper toxicity prior to hatching, but after hatching this effect was reversed, similarly to that observed for the zebrafish. This suggests a potential conserved effect of hypoxia on copper toxicity during embryogenesis across fish species. To investigate if life stage influences the interactions between low oxygen and copper toxicity, the effects of combined exposures were assessed in the adult male three-spined stickleback. The critical oxygen level (Pcrit) was determined to allow appropriate experimental design. The combined exposures to copper and low oxygen resulted in a decreased ability to acclimate to low oxygen. Fish were able to lower their Pcrit in response to low oxygen conditions when exposed to hypoxia alone but not when exposed to hypoxia in combination with copper. Together, these datasets support the hypothesis that the life stage influences the effects of the combined exposure, as hypoxia protects from copper toxicity during early embryogenesis but increases copper toxicity in hatched embryos and in adults. I then investigated whether hypoxia can affect the toxicity of another widespread group of pollutants, anti-androgenic chemicals. Male three-spined sticklebacks were exposed to three anti-androgenic chemicals, flutamide, linuron and fenitrothion, under different <b>air</b> <b>saturations.</b> Each chemical had a unique transcriptional response alone and in combination with reduced oxygen <b>saturation.</b> Under both <b>air</b> <b>saturations,</b> spiggin transcription was strongly inhibited by exposure to flutamide.

In this study, we examined whether water column flow velocity has an effect on gas exchange, and hence on internal oxygen partial pressures (pO 2) in the Mediterranean seagrass, Cymodocea nodosa. We measured the internal pO 2 in the horizontal rhizomes of C. nodosa in darkness at different mainstream flow velocities, combined with different levels of water column oxygen pO 2 using an experimental flume in the laboratory. Flow velocity clearly had an effect on the internal oxygen status.

Oxygen inhibits the growth, since it competes with carbon dioxide for the Rubisco enzyme involved in the CO 2 fixation to generate biomass. The effect of oxygen on growth of Nannochloropsis sp. was experimentally deter-mined in a fully controlled flat-panel photobioreactor operated in turbidostat mode using an incident photon flux density of 100 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1 and with only the oxygen concentration as variable parameter. The dissolved oxygen concentration was varied from 20 to 250 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation.</b> Results showed that there was no clear effect of oxygen concentration on specific growth rate (mean of 0. 48 ± 0. 40 day− 1) upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 20 % to 75 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation.</b> Upon further increasing the oxygen concentration, however, a linear decrease in specific growth rate was observed, ranging from 0. 48 ± 0. 40 day− 1 at a dissolved oxygen concentration of 75 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation</b> to 0. 18 ± 0. 01 day− 1 at 250 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation.</b> In vitro data on isolated Rubisco were used to predict the quantum yield at different oxygen concentrations in the medium. The pre-dicted decrease in quantum yield matches well with the observed decrease that was measured in vivo. These results indicate that the effect of oxygen on growth of Nannochlor-opsis sp. at low light intensity is only due to competitive inhibition of the Rubisco enzyme. At these sub-saturating light conditions, the presence of high concentrations of oxygen in the medium induced slightly higher carotenoid content, but the increased levels of this protective antioxidant did not diminish the growth-inhibiting effects of oxygen on the Rubisco...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli varies the {{synthesis}} of many of its respiratory enzymes in response to oxygen availability. These enzymes include cytochrome o oxidase (cyoABCDE) and cytochrome d oxidase (cydAB), used during aerobic cell growth, and a fumarate reductase (frdABCD), dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine oxide reductase (dmsABC), and nitrate reductase (narGHJI), used during anaerobic respiratory conditions. To determine how different levels of oxygen affect the expression of each operon, strains containing cyo-lacZ, cyd-lacZ, frdA-lacZ, dmsA-lacZ, and narG-lacZ fusions were grown in continuous culture at various degrees of <b>air</b> <b>saturation.</b> The basal-level expression of the anaerobic respiratory genes, frdABCD, dmsABC, and narGHJI, occurred when the <b>air</b> <b>saturation</b> of the medium was above 20 %; as the saturation was reduced to below 10 % (ca. 2 % oxygen), the expression rapidly increased and reached a maximal level at 0 % air. In contrast, cyoABCDE gene expression was lowest under anaerobic conditions while cyd-lacZ expression was about 40 % of its maximum level. When the oxygen level was raised into the microaerophilic range (ca. 7 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation)</b> cyd-lacZ expression was maximal while cyo-lacZ expression was elevated by about fivefold. As the air level was raised to above 20 % saturation, cyd-lacZ expression fell to a basal level while cyo-lacZ expression was increased to its maximum level. The role of the Fnr and ArcA regulatory proteins in this microaerophilic control of respiratory gene expression was documented: whereas Fnr function as an aerobic/anaerobic switch {{in the range of}} 0 to 10 % <b>air</b> <b>saturation,</b> ArcA exerted its control in the 10 to 20 % range. These two transcriptional regulators coordinate the hierarchial control of respiratory pathway gene expression in E. coli to ensure the optimal use of oxygen in the cell environment...|$|E

40|$|GaN epilayers {{grown by}} {{organometallic}} {{vapor phase epitaxy}} {{have been used to}} fabricate resistivegas sensors with a pair of planar ohmic contacts. Detectible sensitivity to H 2 gas {{for a wide range of}} gas mixtures in an Ar ambient has been realized; the lowest concentration tested is ∼ 0. 1 % H 2 (in Ar), well below the lower combustion limit in <b>air.</b> No <b>saturation</b> of the signal is observed up to 100 % H 2 flow. Real-time response to H 2 shows a clear and sharp response with no memory effects during the ramping cycles of H 2 concentration. The change in current at a fixed voltage to hydrogen was found to change with sensor geometry. This appears to be consistent with a surface-adsorption-induced change of conductivity; a detailed picture of the gas sensing mechanism requires further systematic studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{decisions on}} internationally recommended datasets {{are made and}} implemented and, further, how the ownership of these decisions comes about. Examples are given of conventionally agreed data and values where the responsibility is clear and comes about through official designation or by common usage and practice over long time periods. The example of the dataset describing the mass concentration of mercury in <b>air</b> at <b>saturation</b> is discussed in detail. This {{is a case where}} there are now several competing datasets that are in disagreement with each other, some with historical authority and some more recent but, arguably, with more robust metrological traceability to the SI. Further, it is elaborated that there is no body charged with the responsibility to make a decision on an international recommendation for such a dataset. This has led to the situation where several competing datasets are in use simultaneously. Close parallels are drawn with the current debate over changes to the ozone absorption cross section, which has equal importance to the measurement of ozone amount fraction in air and to subsequent compliance with air quality legislation. It is noted {{that in the case of}} the ozone cross section there is already a committee appointed to deliberate over any change. We make the proposal that a similar committee, under the auspices of IUPAC or the CIPM&# 39;s CCQM (if it adopted a reference data function) could be formed to perform a similar role for the mass concentration of mercury in <b>air</b> at <b>saturation.</b> © 2015 BIPM & IOP Publishing Ltd.
