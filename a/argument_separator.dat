5000|$|The <b>argument</b> <b>separator</b> {{processing}} of [...] {{is not the}} only problem with using the [...] program in its default mode. Most Unix tools which are often used to manipulate filenames (for example , , , etc.) are text processing tools. However, Unix path names are not really text. Consider a path name /aaa/bbb/ccc. The /aaa directory and its bbb subdirectory can in general be created by different users with different environments. That means these users could have a different locale setup, and that means that aaa and bbb do not even necessarily have to have the same character encoding. For example, aaa could be in UTF-8 and bbb in Shift JIS. As a result, an absolute path name in a Unix system may not be correctly processable as text under a single character encoding. Tools which rely on their input being text may fail on such strings.|$|E

In 1984, basing their <b>arguments</b> on mass <b>separator</b> measurements, they concluded that the previously formed nuclei are a neutron-deficient super-heavy element with Z=112 and approximately 160 neutrons.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, while Marinov was a {{research}} associate at Rutherford High Energy Laboratories, Oxfordshire, England, he and his associates investigated Tungsten targets which served as 24 GeV proton beam stopper at the CERN Accelerator. Marinovâ€™s thesis was that the proton beam hitting the tungsten target caused very high energy recoil of Tungsten nuclei fractions, which in term would collide and fuse with neighboring Tungsten nuclei in a secondary reaction, leading {{to the creation of}} super-heavy elements. Marinov et al. discovered what they believed to be evidence for the existence of a long-lived super-heavy element with atomic number 112, homologous to Mercury and having a half-life of 47 days. In 1984, basing their <b>arguments</b> on mass <b>separator</b> measurements, Marinov et al. concluded that the previously formed nuclei are neutron-deficient super-heavy element with Z=112 and approximately 160 neutrons. The Super Heavy Element nuclei stability, as well as its unexpected radiation properties were associated by Marinov to isomeric states. In total Marinov et al. claimed to have identified hundreds of nuclei of the new Super Heavy Element number 112. The team used chemical separation technics to isolate the nuclei.|$|R
