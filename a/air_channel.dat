An improved damper geometry with <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> was developed to address contradictory design constraints: large sensing parallel-plate area is desirable for a significant readout capacitance as well as reduced damping coefficient. Damping coefficients were measured at different gaps in conventional parallel-plates MEMS and in parallel-plates with <b>air</b> <b>channels.</b> The inertial masses of the fabricated structures were pulled-in and released. From the return to rest position trajectory, the damping coefficients, at each point, were extracted.

25|$|For most of {{its first}} 30 years on the <b>air,</b> <b>channel</b> 13 {{provided}} spotty coverage to {{the western part of}} the market because it is sandwiched between WLOS-TV in Asheville, North Carolina and WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia. The station made numerous requests to move its transmitter closer to Roanoke. However, they were all turned down by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) each time due to concerns about interference, principally with WOWK. This was despite the fact that the Roanoke/Lynchburg and Huntington/Charleston markets do not border each other. However, the FCC believed that the two markets were close enough that the two channel 13 transmitters had to be as far apart as possible to avoid interference. Its signal was so weak in Roanoke that ABC actually granted an affiliation to a second station in the market, WRFT-TV (channel 27, frequency now occupied by WFXR), for much of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and swallowed. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an <b>air</b> <b>channel</b> in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|A {{mobile device}} {{retrieving}} objects from parallel <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> has to optimize multiple objectives: (1) reduce the response time for object retrieval, and (2) reduce power {{consumption in the}} device. This multi-objective optimization becomes even more difficult when the same object is broadcast multiple times over the parallel <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> to increase availability. In this work, several heuristic algorithms- branch and bound, greedy, random, and first-choice have been proposed for efficient object retrieval from parallel <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> {{in the presence of}} replicated objects. Empirical evaluation of the algorithms shows that the greedy algorithm produces near-optimal-response time with minimum overhead in terms of energy consumption. The runtime of the greedy algorithm is significantly faster than that of the optimal branch and bound algorithm, and is similar to the first-choice and random algorithms. 1...|$|R

30|$|First, as air is {{introduced}} into contaminated soil, air displaces flushing solution {{in the largest}} pores and creates temporary flushing solution flow around flushing point [12].When an air-flushing system achieves steady state, preferential airflow pathways consisting of the largest network of pores are formed in the soil, and the induced local flushing solution flow ceases [20]. Pulsing air injection frequently creates non-steady-state conditions and induces flushing solution circulation as the <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> form and collapse during each cycle. The induced flushing solution flow created by the pulsed air flushing substantially enhances the contaminant and oxygen mass transfer in the soil [5]. Second, contaminants {{in the immediate vicinity}} of <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> can be removed within few time of the start of flushing, but contaminated present at a greater distance from the <b>air</b> <b>channels</b> is less treated because of the limited mass transport (i.e., diffusion) [8].|$|R
