5|$|Journey was {{the last}} game made under a three-game {{contract}} between Thatgamecompany and Sony, the first two being Flow <b>and</b> <b>Flower.</b> Development of the game began in 2009, {{after the release of}} Thatgamecompany's previous title Flower. The 18-person development team for Journey was composed mainly of creators of the company's previous games; co-founder Jenova Chen was the creative director and Nick Clark returned as lead designer. Kellee Santiago, producer of Flow <b>and</b> <b>Flower,</b> did not reprise her duties, concentrating instead on her role as the company's president, and was replaced by Robin Hunicke.|$|E
5|$|Lawton Public Schools serves most of {{the city}} of Lawton. The {{district}} operates two prekindergarten centers, 24 elementary schools, four middle schools, and three high schools – Eisenhower, Lawton, and MacArthur. In 2008, Lawton Public Schools had an enrollment of about 16,000 students with about 1,000 teachers. Two independent districts, Bishop <b>and</b> <b>Flower</b> Mound, serve portions of Lawton. Bishop operates a single PK–6 elementary campus <b>and</b> <b>Flower</b> Mound has a PK–8 campus. Secondary students living in these districts attend Lawton Public Schools. A small portion of far-west Lawton is served by Cache Public Schools.|$|E

5|$|The bulb lies dormant {{after the}} leaves <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down {{further into the}} soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} of vegetative growth to bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> {{is an important}} process in {{the life cycle of}} plants, which is determined by numerous genes forming an intricate network of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> However, no comprehensive identification and profiling of bolting and flowering-related genes have been carried out in radish. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to analyze the differential gene expressions during the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage in radish. A total of 5, 922 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 779 up-regulated and 5, 143 down-regulated genes were isolated. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that some DEGs were involved in hormone signaling pathways and the transcriptional regulation of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> KEGG-based analysis identified 37 DEGs being involved in phytohormone signaling pathways. Moreover, 95 DEGs related to bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> were identified <b>and</b> integrated into various flowering pathways. Several critical genes including FT, CO, SOC 1, FLC and LFY were characterized and profiled by RT-qPCR analysis. Correlation analysis indicated that 24 miRNA-DEG pairs were involved in radish bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> Finally, a miRNA-DEG-based schematic model of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> regulatory network was proposed in radish. These outcomes provided significant insights into genetic control of radish bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering,</b> <b>and</b> would facilitate unraveling molecular regulatory mechanism underlying bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> in root vegetable crops...|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} jo-ha-kyū {{dictates}} virtually every element of Noh including compiling {{of a program}} of plays, structuring of each play, songs and dances within plays, and the basic rhythms within each Noh performance. Jo means beginning, ha means breaking, and kyū means rapid or urgent. The term originated in gagaku, ancient courtly music, to indicate gradually increasing tempo and was adopted in various Japanese traditions including Noh, tea ceremony, poetry, <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The temple itself {{consists}} of several large prayer halls and pavilions for assembly and prayer, statues of Buddha; various Bodhisattvas {{as well as}} Chinese gods are being venerated.

Fish ponds <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> gardens {{are also part of}} the temple complex.|$|E
5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, clarity and {{precision}} and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot's 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in D. H. Lawrence's animal <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> pieces. The rejection of conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E

5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a noose, a goad, a sugarcane bow <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold. She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity <b>and</b> <b>flower.</b> One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{congregation}} had increased {{in size to}} approximately 300 families, and had outgrown its original facilities. The congregation moved to a more suburban location at Eleventh <b>and</b> <b>Flower</b> in 1949, and formalized {{its relationship with the}} Reform movement by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The Central Avenue and Culver Street building was sold to the Southern Baptist Convention, and housed the First Chinese Baptist Church until 1981, and then the Iglesia Bautista Central. By 2001 it was on the market again, and the Jewish community raised $540,000 (today $) to purchase it in 2002. The building is listed on both the city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist {{of a set of}} homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Capcom, Killer7 {{served as}} {{a turning point for}} Suda51 and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, {{effectively}} launching his career. With Capcom as publisher, Killer7 was his first game to be released outside Japan. While its sales were not up to Capcom's standards, the game's cult success encouraged the director to remake two of his older Japan-only games, The Silver Case <b>and</b> <b>Flower,</b> Sun, and Rain, for Western release. It also allowed his next major title, No More Heroes, to be released to critical and commercial success. The game also cemented Suda51's status as an auteur video game director. He would later work with Shinji Mikami again on Shadows of the Damned.|$|E
