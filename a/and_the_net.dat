5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E

25|$|Phosphoprotein {{phosphatase}} {{is activated}} by the hormone insulin, {{which indicates that}} there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase. This leads to phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase's becoming inactive, while glycogen synthase is activated. As a result, glycogen synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.|$|E

25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure).

Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle.

25|$|Although {{clomipramine}} shows around 100- to 200-fold {{preference in}} {{affinity for the}} SERT over the NET, its major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (norclomipramine), binds to the NET with very high affinity (Ki = 0.32nM) and with dramatically reduced affinity for the SERT (Ki = 31.6nM). Moreover, desmethylclomipramine circulates at concentrations that are approximately twice those of clomipramine. In accordance, occupancy of both the SERT <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>NET</b> has been shown with clomipramine administration in positron emission tomography studies with humans and non-human primates. As such, clomipramine {{is in fact a}} fairly balanced SNRI rather than only a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).|$|E
25|$|According to {{extended}} habitable zone theory, planetary mass {{objects with}} atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther {{out from the}} Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth (super-Earth class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough {{is known about the}} nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced albedo, anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.|$|E
25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E

25|$|In {{economics}} and consumer theory, a Giffen good {{is a product}} that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, {{as the price of}} the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it.|$|E
25|$|The {{lines that}} {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark {{in the center of each}} baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E
25|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves {{the air around}} it, {{producing}} sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes {{the character of the}} sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.|$|E
