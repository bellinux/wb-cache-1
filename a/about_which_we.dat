5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, <b>about</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

Often there is large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues etc. (see below). Sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance, we might study rats {{in order to get a}} better understanding of human health, or we might study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, the play has been {{produced}} sporadically in the English-speaking world, {{although it has}} proved more popular in Europe. Indeed, {{there have been only}} a few significant English speaking productions. Little is known, for example, about Harley Granville-Barker's 1904 production at the Court Theatre, F.R. Benson's 1910 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Robert Atkins' 1923 production at the Apollo Theatre, or Ben Iden Payne's 1938 production at Stratford-upon-Avon. The earliest production <b>about</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have significant information is Michael Langham's 1957 production at The Old Vic, starring Richard Gale as Valentine, Keith Michell as Proteus, Barbara Jefford as Julia and Ingrid Hafner as Silvia. In this production, set in late nineteenth-century Italy and grounded very much in high Romanticism, Proteus threatens to kill himself with a pistol {{at the end of the}} play, prompting Valentine's hasty offer of Silvia.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Douglas Smith, Rasputin's {{youth and}} early adulthood are [...] "a black hole <b>about</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> know almost nothing," [...] though {{the lack of}} reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about his parents and his youth after Rasputin's rise to fame. Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was never formally educated, and he remained illiterate well into his early adulthood. Local archival records suggest {{that he had a}} somewhat unruly youth - possibly involving drinking, small thefts, and disrespect for local authorities - but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy, or bearing false witness, all major crimes that he was later rumored to have committed as a young man.|$|E
2500|$|Assuming Quaresma {{is indeed}} Fernando de Noronha, then who {{discovered}} it? [...] One proposal {{is that it}} was discovered by a royal Portuguese mapping expedition that was sent out in May, 1501, commanded by an unknown captain (possibly André Gonçalves) and also accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci. [...] According to Vespucci, this expedition returned to Lisbon in September 1502, just on time to influence the final composition of the Cantino map. [...] Unfortunately, Vespucci does not report discovering this island then – indeed he is quite clear that the first time he (and his fellow sailors) saw the island was on the 1503 Coelho expedition. However, there is a letter written by an Italian saying that a ship arrived [...] "from the land of Parrots" [...] in Lisbon on July 22, 1502 (three months before Vespucci). [...] This could be a stray ship from the mapping expedition that returned prematurely, or another expedition altogether, <b>about</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have no information. [...] The timing of its reputed arrival (July 1502), makes it possible that it stumbled on the island sometime in March 1502, on the homeward voyage, well within Lent.|$|E
2500|$|His {{reason is}} that it puts the {{entities}} <b>about</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> require knowledge behind a [...] "veil of perception", an occult field of [...] "appearance" [...] which leaves us ignorant of the reality presumed to be beyond it. He is convinced that such uncertainty propels into the dangerous regions of relativism and solipsism: relativism sees all truth {{as determined by the}} single observer; solipsism, in which the single observer is the only creator of and legislator for his or her own universe, carries the assumption that no one else exists. These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being something going on in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for {{the fact that in the}} 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as going on inside the head. The argument was usually strengthened with mockery at the very idea of [...] "redness" [...] being in the brain: the question was—and still is—"How can there be red neurons in the brain?" [...] which strikes one as a justifiable appeal to common sense.|$|E
