5|$|Shortly {{before the}} June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary, Moran {{endorsed}} Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{for the presidency}} over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. Explaining his endorsement, he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria's coal-fired power plant would be more attainable under Obama than under Clinton. Obama won the Virginia primary, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> state {{when he won the}} general election in November.|$|E

5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth was {{two years}} and eight months old when her mother was {{beheaded}} on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes. Elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of {{her place in the}} royal succession. Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the birth of their son, Prince Edward, in 1537. From his birth, Edward was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. Elizabeth was placed in his household <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.|$|E
5|$|From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive. The division was reassigned to XIX Corps, and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> division through Jülich, Broich, Immerath, and Titz, to Mönchengladbach by 1 March 1945. The division was out of combat in March. In early April {{the division}} was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr area. On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, pushed to the Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest. After V-E Day, the division was on military duty in the Bremen enclave. It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her. She operated on the England–Australia route for almost 30 years, interrupted only by two relatively brief sojourns as a troopship during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. Gradually, {{she earned a}} reputation as the most reliable of the emigrant ships to Australia <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> first English cricket team to tour Australia in 1861.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performances during the game, North Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team, and Virginia Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen was named the most valuable player of the losing team. Keldorf finished the game having completed 12 of his 28 pass attempts for 290 yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Sorensen completed four of eight passes for 24 yards <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball 10 times on the ground for a total of 19 yards. Al Clark, the quarterback whom Sorensen replaced, finished the game having completed nine of 17 pass attempts for 66 yards.|$|E
5|$|Junior quarterback Denard Robinson {{completed}} 9-of-14 {{passes for}} 170 yards <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball 15 times for 63 {{yards and a}} touchdown. He scored his 29th career rushing touchdown on a two-yard run midway through the first quarter. Robinson moved to ninth place among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category, where he is tied with Butch Woolfolk (1978–81). Robinson has scored at least one rushing touchdown in seven straight games. Fitzgerald Toussaint recorded career highs in carries (20) and rushing yards (170) and matched a career best with two rushing touchdowns. Toussaint's second touchdown—a 59-yard rush in the third quarter—was the longest rush for a touchdown of his career, but missed his overall career long by two yards (61 yards vs. Bowling Green, September 25, 2010). The Apollo 15 flight crew, which consisted of all Michigan graduates, was honored during the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Al Clark completed seven of his 14 passes for 71 yards and an interception. Clark's greatest success came on the ground, however, as he rushed nine times for 55 yards and a touchdown. Most of Virginia Tech's offense came on the ground, as Clark was surpassed in the rushing game by Shyrone Stith, who carried the ball 10 times for 71 yards and a touchdown. Fellow Tech running back Lamont Pegues scored two touchdowns <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball 15 times for 41 yards.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} developments of note in Depot Town was the Western Hotel, built by Mark Norris. Opening in May 1839, the Western Hotel stood on a triangular plot west of River Street and north of the railroad track. Around 1860, the Michigan Central Railroad bought the land to replace the old wood plank depot with a newer, more modern brick depot. Norris demolished his hotel <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> bricks across River Street, where he built a three-story Italianate structure, which {{became known as the}} Norris Block.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian {{to compete}} in {{bobsleigh}} represented Great Britain. Frederick McEvoy drove the British two-man and four-man bobsleighs in 1936, earning fourth place and a bronze respectively, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> British flag at the opening ceremony. Australia first competed in bobsleigh in 1988, and has competed in the event in every Olympics since, except for 2002. Paul Narracott became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics: he competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics, and participated in bobsleigh in 1992 as the brakeman. Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994. They did not compete in skeleton in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The first {{banknotes}} of Zimbabwe {{were issued}} by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 {{to coincide with the}} independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.|$|E

5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before the sailor could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E
5|$|East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US40 {{passes through}} Clarysville, where it intersects MD55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain {{followed}} by Alt US40 changes: from Clarysville westward {{to the summit}} of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, {{is located on the}} hillside above Alt US40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. Alt US40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD53 and MD658, which intersects Alt US40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD658. East of the intersection with MD658, Alt US40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD49).|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{she took}} Prime Minister İsmet İnönü from Varna to Istanbul <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> Shah of Iran from Trebizond to Samsun the {{following}} year. Yavuz Sultan Selim had her name officially shortened to Yavuz Sultan in 1930 {{and then to}} Yavuz in 1936. Another short refit was conducted in 1938, and in November that year she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit. She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937, partly due to their substandard anti-aircraft armament, but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force. Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10,000 ton cruisers and twelve destroyers. Yavuz would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945, and the navy expected to build a 23,000 ton ship between 1950 and 1960. The naval building program did not come about, as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated {{on the needs of}} their own nations leading up to World War II.|$|E
