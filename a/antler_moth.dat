50|$|Deschampsia {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>antler</b> <b>moth,</b> the clay, clouded-bordered brindle, common wainscot, dark arches, dusky brocade, shoulder-striped wainscot, smoky wainscot and wall.|$|E
50|$|Cerapteryx graminis, the <b>antler</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is a common species {{throughout}} most of Europe but is lacking in the very dry southern regions. The northernmost occurrence is Iceland, and above the Arctic circle. It also occurs in Siberia and in North Mongolia. The species has been introduced to North America. In the Alps it rises to an altitude of 2100 meters.|$|E
40|$|A broad {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} to characterise microbes associated with larval outbreaks of the <b>Antler</b> <b>moth</b> Cerapteryx graminis in Cumbria, United Kingdom. A nucleopolyhedrovirus {{present in all}} sampled populations at <= 5 % prevalence, was characterised via {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and partial sequencing the Polyhedrin, Lef- 8 and Lef- 9 genes; indicating a previously uncharacterised species most closely related to Agrotis ipsilon NPV. A survey of the host-associated bacterial community detected a species phylogenetically related to Spiroplasma sp., a male-killing phenotype previously isolated from Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, present at < 63 % prevalence in larvae. The implications of these associated microbes for host population dynamics are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
