25|$|The film is stunningly {{beautiful}} at times, and wildly ambitious, {{an attempt}} to be both wordless and wordy, {{to get to the}} hypnotic state that poetry and music can induce while saying something meaningful about black and white attitudes to land and love. This last part, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> Murray, is largely imposed and disruptive, trying to pin a romantic political agenda to the work that's hardly there. It makes the film too literal, too current, when it wants to lodge itself in the more mysterious part of the brain. The film still has a power – Haywood's performance is magnificent – but it never achieves a strong inner reality. It falls short of its own tall ambitions.|$|E

The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E

2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E
