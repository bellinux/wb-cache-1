25|$|The hexagram {{does appear}} {{occasionally}} in Jewish contexts since antiquity, apparently as a decorative motif. For example, in Israel, {{there is a}} stone bearing a hexagram from the arch of a 3rd–4th century synagogue in the Galilee. Originally, the hexagram may have been employed as an <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament</b> on synagogues, as it is, for example, on the cathedrals of Brandenburg and Stendal, and on the Marktkirche at Hanover. A pentagram in this form is found on the ancient synagogue at Tell Hum. In the synagogues, perhaps, it {{was associated with the}} mezuzah.|$|E

25|$|The {{available}} evidence indicates a construction {{date in the}} Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The scaenae frons (stage front) was certainly put up at this time, as the style of both sculpture and <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament</b> suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative on her part. We do not know what stood here before the 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.|$|E

2500|$|A Green Man is a sculpture, {{or other}} {{representation}} of a face surrounded by or made from leaves.

2500|$|The motifs {{and designs}} on the relief-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman {{decorative}} arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes. [...] Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, {{and in many}} cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops. [...] Some of the decoration relates to contemporary <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament,</b> with egg-and-tongue (ovolo) mouldings, acanthus and vine scrolls and the like. [...] While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of 'romanisation', the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{recognisable}} decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet {{on a high}} pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table {{vessels of}} the same period, such as the Warren Cup. [...] The iconography, too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo (egg-and-tongue) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament.</b> The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the poinçons (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists. [...] Major workshops, {{such as those of}} M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.|$|E

60|$|In Greek art {{the modes}} of {{representing}} water are far more varied. Two conventional imitations, the wave moulding and the Mæander, are well known. Both are probably of the most remote antiquity; both have been largely employed as an <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament,</b> and subordinately as a decoration of vases, costume, furniture and implements. In the wave moulding we have a conventional representation of the small crisping waves which break upon {{the shore of the}} Mediterranean, the sea of the Greeks.|$|E

60|$|In the 13th and 14th {{paragraphs}} of Chapter XXI. of {{the first}} volume of this work, it was noticed that the systems of <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament,</b> properly so called, might be divided into three:--1. Servile ornament, in which the execution or power of the inferior workman is entirely subjected to the intellect of the higher:--2. Constitutional ornament, in which the executive inferior power is, to a certain point, emancipated and independent, having a will of its own, yet confessing its inferiority and rendering obedience to higher powers;--and 3. Revolutionary ornament, in which no executive inferiority is admitted at all. I must here explain the nature of these divisions at somewhat greater length.|$|E

The entrance portico of San Jacopo sopr'Arno in Florence was remade in 1580 by Radi. He helped design the Rosette window for the church of Santa Maria Nuova, Cortona.|$|R
60|$|In {{this course}} which our {{ancestors}} took {{there was a}} show of prudence at least, as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first. But are the more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of acquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred, for, so to speak, {{the country is not}} yet adapted to human culture, and we are still forced to cut our spiritual bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament</b> is to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. In {{spite of}} these embarrassments, however, some few certainties may be marked in the {{treatment}} of past architecture, and secure conclusions deduced for future practice. There is first, for instance, the assuredly intended and resolute abstraction of the Ninevite and Egyptian sculptors. The men who cut those granite lions in the Egyptian room of the British Museum, and who carved the calm faces of those Ninevite kings, knew much more, both of lions and kings, than they chose to express. Then there is the Greek system, in which the human sculpture is perfect, the architecture and animal sculpture is subordinate to it, and the <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament</b> severely subordinated to this again, so as to be composed of little more than abstract lines: and, finally, there is the peculiarly mediæval system, in which the inferior details are carried to as great or greater imitative perfection as the higher sculpture; and the subordination is chiefly effected by symmetries of arrangement, and quaintnesses of treatment, respecting which it is difficult to say how far they resulted from intention, and how far from incapacity.|$|E
6000|$|... 163. Having got it well in, you {{may then}} further understand, safely, that three {{is a great}} deal of {{secondary}} work in pots, and pans, and floors, and carpets, and shawls, and <b>architectural</b> <b>ornament,</b> which ought essentially, to be unlike reality, and to depend for its charm on quite other qualities than imitative ones. But all such art is inferior and secondary--much of it more or less instinctive and animal, and a civilized human creature can only learn those principles rightly, by knowing those of great civilized art first--which is always the representation, to the utmost of its power, of whatever it has got to show--made to look as like the thing as possible. Go into the National Gallery, and look at the foot of Correggio's Venus there. Correggio made it as like a foot as he could, and you won't easily find anything liker. Now, you will find on any Greek vase something meant for a foot, or a hand, which is not at all like one. The Greek vase is a good thing in its way, but Correggio's picture is the best work.|$|E
