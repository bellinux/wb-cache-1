Monastics often fast on Mondays (in imitation of the Angels, who are commemorated on {{that day in the}} weekly cycle, since monastics <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> to lead an angelic life on earth, and angels neither eat nor drink).|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{photosynthesis}} uses techniques including nanotechnology {{to store}} solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol. Researchers {{in this field}} <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable {{in a variety of}} environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells). However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012, because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders {{is to make sure}} their respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and make sure all members in the row <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during the week before the rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E

2500|$|The greater {{majority}} of MTs presently {{work from home}} offices rather than in hospitals, working off-site for [...] "national" [...] transcription services. It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> to outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, {{at the risk of}} losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers. [...] In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs (independent contractors); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc. Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate {{as they did in the}} past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.|$|E
