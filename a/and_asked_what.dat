Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|With {{the plans}} for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be {{attempted}} across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka {{had a lot of}} leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} ready for review and {{presentation}} to Congressional leaders when Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. A few days after President Kennedy's funeral, President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Jacqueline Kennedy in the Oval Office <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he could do for her. Mrs. Kennedy requested two things: That Cape Canaveral be renamed for her husband, and that the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan move forward. Word of the request leaked to the public, and Johnson publicly supported the area's redevelopment on October 24, 1964. Johnson subsequently approved {{the establishment of a}} Temporary President's Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue (composed of Cabinet members, federal planners, architects, and others) to move the plan forward, although it did not hold its first meeting until May 21, 1965. The Temporary Commission's goal was to push for a permanent body with the legal authority to engage in condemnation and force public and private bodies to conform to its plans. Before the Temporary Commission was named, District of Columbia officials agreed to abandon plans to build an office building west of the District Building, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to reorient its planned headquarters more squarely with Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E

500|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered at}} Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized {{the seriousness of}} the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, [...] "I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order."

500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> I wanted.

500|$|Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with Rimsky-Korsakov {{had gone through}} changes {{by the time he}} visited St. Petersburg in November 1887. As a member of The Five, Rimsky-Korsakov had been essentially self-educated as a composer. He regarded Tchaikovsky with suspicion since he possessed an academic background and did not agree with the musical philosophy espoused by The Five. However, when Rimsky-Korsakov was appointed to a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871, he recognized that he was ill-prepared to take on such a task. He had also reached a compositional impasse, and realized he was essentially on a creative path leading nowhere. He sent a letter to Tchaikovsky in which he outlined his situation <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> he ought to do. The letter [...] "deeply touched and amazed" [...] Tchaikovsky with its poignancy. As Tchaikovsky later relayed to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Of course he had to study".|$|E

The following day they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many white people supported them. In an editorial, the Bristol Evening Post pointed out that the TGWU opposed apartheid in South Africa <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months." ...|$|E

[...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|At 14:35, Park and Churchill {{watched the}} battle unfold in Uxbridge's {{operations}} room. The Prime Minister saw that every squadron {{was being used}} <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> reserves were available. Park said there were none. He was referring only to 11 Group, as there were more aircraft in nearby sectors, {{but at this point}} Park was stretched. At Park's request, he had sent all the Squadrons from No. 10 and 12 Group that were adjacent to 11 Group to the capital. If the Luftwaffe launched a follow up attack, there were only three Squadrons available, in 12 and 10 Group (based in Norfolk and Dorset) and none in the Kent region. All other day squadrons were based too far away to get involved. Nevertheless, Park knew that a low cloud base over RAF Croydon (...) , Hornchurch (...) , Northolt (...) , RAF Hendon (...) and Biggin Hill (...) would make a low-level accurate strike the Germans' only option. High-altitude attacks were improbable. Possibly to create a reserve, Park ordered 41, 213 and 605 Squadrons to return early though they had only been airborne for 45 minutes and had plenty of fuel left, even if ammunition was short. The vast bulk of the remaining squadrons were heading to London. A total of 185 fighters in 19 Squadrons were ready to engage. The battle would involve over 600 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The {{extent of}} Digby's {{knowledge}} of the plot is unknown, but {{in the opinion of}} author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> would become of some of their Catholic friends. [...] Catesby replied [...] "Assure your selfe that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter." [...] None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. [...] He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. [...] Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. [...] Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would [...] "the better {{to be able to do}} good to the cause [...] ". [...] From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready for some kind of military manoeuvre. [...] Digby also provided monetary assistance; he promised Â£1,500 after fellow plotter Thomas Percy failed to pay the rent due for several properties in Westminster.|$|E
