5|$|Within {{two years}} the Boston {{membership}} had exceeded the original church's capacity. By 1903 the block around the church had been purchased by Christian Scientists, and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension, accommodating 5,000 people, was completed {{at a cost of}} $2 million. This attracted the criticism that, whereas Christian Scientists spent money on <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> church, they maintained no hospitals, orphanages or missions in the slums.|$|E

The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Taurus was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E
5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided {{to add a}} new chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood {{in the context of}} its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E

5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> {{religious}} and cultural centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{were very}} close, {{in matters of}} {{business}} and personally. Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and, with his brother, adopted the ancient heraldic device of the earls of Warwick, the bear and ragged staff. Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special significance for him. The town of Warwick felt this during <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate {{the feast of the}} Order of Saint Michael, with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566. He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester's Hospital, a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after he}} became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours {{circulated}} that she bore him four sons, {{and that he had}} a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> household, sufficient for him to be able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell {{was the subject of a}} guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.|$|E

5|$|In 1661 it {{was given}} to Stefan Czarniecki as a reward for his service in the victory over the Swedes during the Deluge. Four years later, {{it was given}} as a dowry of his {{daughter}} Aleksandra, who married Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki, thus passing {{into the hands of the}} Branicki family. In 1692, Stefan Mikołaj Branicki, the son of Jan Klemens Branicki (Marshal of the Crown Court), obtained city rights for Białystok from King John III Sobieski. He constructed the Branicki Palace on the foundations of the castle of the Wiesiołowski family. In the second half of the eighteenth century the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. It was he who transformed the palace built by his father into <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> residence of a great noble.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) (c.1535 – 12 February 1554) was {{the husband}} of Lady Jane Grey who, {{declared}} as his heir by King Edward VI, occupied the English throne from 10July until 19July 1553. Guildford Dudley enjoyed a humanist education and was married to Jane in <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> celebration about six weeks before the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They {{were still in the}} Tower when their regime collapsed and they remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against her plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh.|$|E

The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion {{that it was a}} great film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film was labeled a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic Mirror on June 18, 1910.|$|E
5|$|Walter Devereux {{was raised}} to the earldom of Essex in 1572. In 1573 he {{successfully}} suggested to the Queen a project to plant Englishmen in Ulster. In the autumn he went to Ireland, not to return for two years. During this time Lettice Devereux possibly engaged in a love-affair with the Earl of Leicester; her whereabouts in the following years are largely unknown, though. In 1573 Leicester sent her a present of venison to Chartley from his seat Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, and she made hunting visits to Kenilworth in 1574 and 1576. She was also present in July 1575 when Dudley entertained the Queen with <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> 19-days festival at the castle. Elizabeth and the court (including the Earl of Leicester) then progressed to Chartley, where they were welcomed by the Countess of Essex.|$|E
5|$|John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick, KB (1527(?) – 21 October 1554) was an English nobleman and {{the heir}} of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, leading {{minister}} and regent under Edward VI of England from 15501553. As his father's career progressed, John Dudley respectively assumed his father's former titles, Viscount Lisle and Earl of Warwick. Interested {{in the arts}} and sciences, he was the dedicatee of several books by eminent scholars, both during his lifetime and posthumously. His marriage to the former Protector Somerset's eldest daughter, {{in the presence of the}} King and <b>a</b> <b>magnificent</b> setting, was a gesture of reconciliation between the young couple's fathers. However, their struggle for power flared up again and ended with the Duke of Somerset's execution. In July 1553, after King Edward's death, Dudley was one of the signatories of the letters patent that attempted to set Lady Jane Grey on the throne of England, and took arms against Mary Tudor, alongside his father. The short campaign did not see any military engagements and ended as the Duke of Northumberland and his son were taken prisoners at Cambridge. John Dudley the younger was condemned to death yet reprieved. He died shortly after his release from the Tower of London.|$|E
