5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E

25|$|The {{rise of the}} Finnish {{language}} to an increasingly prevalent position in society was, at the outset, mainly <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> of eager promoters of the Finnish language from the higher strata of society, mainly with Swedish-speaking family backgrounds. A later development, especially {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, was the adoption or translation or modification of Swedish surnames into Finnish (fennicization).

25|$|Some feminists contend that, as {{with other}} women saints such as Joan of Arc, the image of Mary is <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> of the patriarchal mind. They argue that Marian dogmas and doctrines and the typical forms of Marian devotion {{reinforce}} patriarchy by offering women temporary comfort from the ongoing oppression inflicted on them by male dominated churches and societies. In the feminist view, old gender stereotypes persist within traditional Marian teachings and theological doctrines. To that end books on feminist Mariology have been published to present opposing interpretations and perspectives.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} {{describe the}} nature connectedness construct in a simpler manner.

Similarly, nature connectedness can be defined as how much a person believes they are the same as nature (more specifically, a person's connectivity with nature) or it {{can be thought of}} as simply feeling emotionally connected with nature. Nature connectedness (as <b>a</b> <b>construct)</b> is also known as nature relatedness, connectivity with nature, emotional affinity toward nature, or inclusion of nature in self.|$|E

25|$|Limerence is {{characterized}} by intrusive thinking and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense joy or as extreme despair, {{depending on whether the}} feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned passion or love, {{even to the point of}} addictive-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> of romantic fiction.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells {{of types of}} cell. This library can be ligated into <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> {{so that it is}} attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.|$|E
25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that people with high EI have greater mental health, job performance, and {{leadership}} skills although no causal relationships have been shown and such findings {{are likely to be}} attributable to general intelligence and specific personality traits rather than emotional intelligence as <b>a</b> <b>construct.</b> For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ. Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is non-significant when ability and personality are controlled for, and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership. Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade. In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Data {{should not}} be removed {{on the basis of}} misfitting the model, but rather because <b>a</b> <b>construct</b> {{relevant}} reason for the misfit has been diagnosed, such as a non-native speaker of English taking a science test written in English. Such a candidate can be argued to not belong to the same population of persons depending on the dimensionality of the test, and, although one parameter IRT measures are argued to be sample-independent, they are not population independent, so misfit such as this is construct relevant and does not invalidate the test or the model. Such an approach is an essential tool in instrument validation. In two and three-parameter models, where the psychometric model is adjusted to fit the data, future administrations of the test must be checked for fit to the same model used in the initial validation in order to confirm the hypothesis that scores from each administration generalize to other administrations. If a different model is specified for each administration in order to achieve data-model fit, then a different latent trait is being measured and test scores cannot be argued to be comparable between administrations.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{several of}} the {{developers}} of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated {{in an effort to}} improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. <b>A</b> <b>construct</b> is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.|$|E
