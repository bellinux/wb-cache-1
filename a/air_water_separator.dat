40|$|The {{ability to}} control the {{temperature}} and humidity of an environment or habitat is critical for human survival. These factors are important to maintaining human health and comfort, as well as maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment in good working order to support the human and to accomplish mission objectives. The temperature and humidity of the International Space Station (ISS) United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) cabin air {{is controlled by the}} Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA). The CCAA consists of a fan, a condensing heat exchanger (CHX), an air/water separator, temperature and liquid sensors, and electrical controlling hardware and software. The <b>Water</b> <b>Separator</b> (WS) pulls in <b>air</b> and <b>water</b> from the CHX, and centrifugally separates the mixture, sending the water to the condensate bus and the air back into the CHX outlet airstream. Two distinct early failures of the CCAA <b>Water</b> <b>Separator</b> in the Quest Airlock forced operational changes and brought about the re-design of the <b>Water</b> <b>Separator</b> to improve the useful life via modification kits. The on-orbit operational environment of the Airlock presented challenges that were not foreseen with the original design of the <b>Water</b> <b>Separator.</b> Operational changes were instituted to prolong the life of the third installed WS, while waiting for newly designed <b>Water</b> <b>Separators</b> to be delivered on-orbit. The modification kit design involved several different components of the <b>Water</b> <b>Separator,</b> including the innovative use of a fabrication technique to build the impellers used in <b>Water</b> <b>Separators</b> out of titanium instead of aluminum. The technique allowed for the cost effective production of the low quantity build. This paper will describe the failures of the <b>Water</b> <b>Separators</b> in the Quest Airlock, the operational constraints that were implemented to prolong the life of the installed <b>Water</b> <b>Separators</b> throughout the USOS, and the innovative re-design of the CCAA <b>Water</b> <b>Separator...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{assembly}} of devices provides for both humidification of the reactant gas streams of {{a fuel cell}} and removal of the product water (the water generated by operation of the fuel cell). The assembly includes externally-sensing forward-pressure regulators that supply reactant gases (fuel and oxygen) at variable pressures to ejector reactant pumps. The ejector supply pressures depend on the consumption flows. The ejectors develop differential pressures approximately proportional to the consumption flow rates at constant system pressure and with constant flow restriction between the mixer-outlet and suction ports of the ejectors. For removal of product water from the circulating oxygen stream, the assembly includes a water/gas separator that contains hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes. The <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> imposes an approximately constant flow restriction, regardless {{of the quality of}} the two-phase flow that enters it from the fuel cell.
