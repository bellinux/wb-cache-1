50|$|The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 authorises altruistic {{surrogacy}} in New Zealand, but prohibits commercial surrogacy {{agreements and}} bans {{a person from}} receiving valuable consideration for participating in a surrogacy agreement or for arranging for another person {{to participate in a}} surrogacy agreement. The ban however is not <b>absolute.</b> <b>Payment</b> for specific reasonable and necessary expenses are permitted as well as permitting payment to an independent legal advisor for the woman who is or may become pregnant due to a surrogacy agreement. Section 13 adds to this section and provides that there may be no commercial supply of human embryos or human gametes. The Act also states that “a surrogacy arrangement is not of itself illegal, but is not enforceable by or against any person”. The phrasing is unique and seems to offer little protection for any of the involved parties. If the birth mother decides not to honour the surrogacy agreement the contracting parties are not able to bring a claim against the other and hold her to the agreement. In contrast if the contracting parties, {{during the course of the}} pregnancy or after birth, decide that they do not want to honour the agreement and seek adoption of the child the birth mother would be unable to seek fulfilment of the agreement.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a novel {{explanation}} for why some firms prefer to pay dividends rather than repurchase shares. It is well-known that institutional investors are relatively less taxed than individual investors, and that this induces "dividend clientele" effects. We argue that these clientele effects are the very reason {{for the presence of}} dividends, because institutions have a relative advantage in monitoring firms or in detecting firm quality. Firms paying dividends attract relatively more institutions and perform better. The theory is consistent with some documented regularities, such as a reluctance of firms to cut dividends, and offers novel empirical implications, such as a prediction that is the tax difference between institutions and retail investors that determines dividend <b>payments,</b> not the <b>absolute</b> tax <b>payments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} why some firms prefer to pay dividends rather than repurchase shares. When institutional investors are relatively less taxed than individual investors, dividends induce "ownership clientele" effects. Firms paying dividends attract relatively more institutions, {{which have a}} relative advantage in detecting high firm quality and in ensuring firms are well managed. The theory is consistent with some documented regularities, specifically both the presence and stickiness of dividends, and offers novel empirical implications, e. g., a prediction {{that it is the}} tax difference between institutions and retail investors that determines dividend <b>payments,</b> not the <b>absolute</b> tax <b>payments.</b> # Allen is from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

The most conspicuous changes occurred in the broiler chicken industry, which is essentially entirely vertically coordinated either via production contracts or company-owned farms.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a tax system is relevant to public health. Wage taxes are the predominant form of taxation in both Europe and the United States. Yet, high rates of wage taxation harm worker health particularly when wage taxes {{are part of an}} overall regressive tax system. The causal mechanisms for the negative effect of wage taxes on public health occur by (i) pushing marginal workers into <b>absolute</b> poverty by <b>payment</b> of wage taxes; (ii) increasing working hours for low-wage workers; (iii) increasing levels of economic inequality by relatively higher tax and audit rates of persons with labor income; and (iv) reducing financial (and time) investment in children by overburdened workers. Optimal tax policy accordingly requires an evaluation of the cost of wage taxes levied on “health capital” of workers as well as financial capital...|$|R
40|$|Services {{trade is}} an {{important}} source of growth in Malaysia and Singapore. Both economies are export-oriented and actively court foreign direct investment (FDI) to advance their economic objectives of industrialisation and economic development. This paper examines the causal linkages between inward FDI and the country’s engagement in services trade in bi-variate and tri-variate VAR frameworks. The empirical findings for Singapore show evidence of bidirectional causality between inward FDI and the total trade volume in services (i. e. the <b>absolute</b> sum of <b>payments</b> and receipts) as well as between FDI and services imports (in the tri-variate specification). This may reflect her relative open foreign investment policy and free trade regime in services. For Malaysia, the evidence of causality is weaker and unidirectional, from inward FDI to services imports. These findings are consistent with the different stages of economic development and openness attained by the two sample countries, and they provide useful background for trade and foreign investment policies and development strategies.

As a result of this study has been understood that in Ottoman society institution of the family is very important.

Screened almost negligible in Ottoman Konya no more marriage. Average offour children, their families has been understood. We do work on the subject have been covered by the book dates from 1748 to 1749 are the year. That we have examined thenumber of documents in the record book in 93 leaf 672 pieces. 152 of these documents constitutes one of the property sales.

In addition to women than to men nisbetle wide possibility togive the divorce in Islamic law mehr mehr particularly high müeccel eclipse of the right to divorce misuse is a significant obstacleto women and married a certain economic security and independence to provide the services that can be said. Yet a notable case in point is the proportion of leading women from twenty-four cases opened on one of the women. Contrary to general opinion, and the majority of women have joined the court in a document only through counsel women weredivorced. Divorced him from the case on a mandate to belong to men. On the record that in our study in 57 numbered Konya şer'iye,polygamous men were observed to be very small. Approximately 157 family with two married only six relevant documents are being found more than two who are married spousehas not been found. These rates also corresponds to 4 % Islam in certain circumstances be allowed to have broken the family unit. Divorce in Jewish practice adopted in the systemdifficult to divorce with her non-Christians will never accept a middle path is located between application has the appearance. Prophet of prophets wives and family unity and continue to be good to each other about the various orders andrecommendations have been. The woman's husband in the divorce of freedom is observed. This divorce of the husband of the financial burden on theshoulders of all the divorce and her husband will be carefully considered before decisions are dating. At the same time not feelingup to men and women generally granted a divorce will not be abused, this approach also is very important in this subject. Indeed,her husband has the same freedom that the divorce rate is not reflected in the exercises. Women in divorce has a more limitedauthority. Divorce with the request (one sided) have almost negligible, usually due to lack of women to have children wasrevealed. Muhalaa 'if either of the spouses or with the mutual desire of women that one of the following cases will be done bydisplaying the request would occur because of, the woman's livelihood is not provided in sufficient degree, husband, wife -husband violated the relationship, if ikdidarsızsa, apostasy. Indeed, in these terms between men and women bring about inequalityis annoying. But everywhere in otttoman teriroty for their traditions organized establishments, this inequality itself felt in daily lifewill not have a costume impersonation. In the majority of documents related to the divorce as a reason not to understand that Hüsn-i zendigânî shown. In this casethe mutual understanding that muhalaa 'divorced. In this case, women often used right of Mahr. Yet as a reason for a divorce inthe document is not shown anything in the case of her husband to go out of town (Diyar-ı Aher) and do not come to much timeon condition that his wife is to authorize divorce. This type of divorce, as was done acting my full view of women are not takingmahr. Because the divorce as a condition of their wives and other rights giving up of mahr is required. Yet documents in oneneighborhood Ahmed Dede had wanted to divorce from the woman named Havva, and another for the rights of the response ingiving up of mahr used has not received, plus 15 cents for divorce from former wife of Uveys fee is paid. To determine the number of children Şer'iye record is possible. That we have examined approximately 39 of the family inKonya şer'iye record number of children reached. The total number of 115 children were found. Five of the family is deemed tobe childless. The average for families with children can be said to have four children. Only when there is a family of five boys, ona family's only daughter is. On eight of the family of the boy and girl has been found. At least one up to eight children are seen inchildren and childless families were encountered. Exceptions are those with many children of the Ottoman family. Those most replications, respectively one, two, three arechildren. Peasant families urban families, non-Muslims have very little in terms of number of children who are late. Girls areslightly more male children is also important to note. Within this framework, the classical period of Ottoman family does not findeven the average of five people...|$|R
