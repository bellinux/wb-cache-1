25|$|Although a spinoff of The Weather Channel, Local Now is {{formatted}} as {{a general}} news and weather channel. Because of the distribution structure of over-the-top subscription television, Local Now utilizes a version of TWC's IntelliStar unit – installed <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Weather</b> Channel's uplink site in Atlanta – that are configured differently from that used by The Weather Channel and Weatherscan, allowing for the recycling of segments featured in one news block seamlessly into another and routine updating of segments {{to each of the}} localized feeds. Local Now's automated model – which leverages The Weather Channel's existing infrastructure and technology, and employs only three staff members – allows Local Now to be offered {{at a fraction of the}} retransmission rates charged by local broadcast stations. Users of the Local Now website and mobile app, and subscribers of over-the-top MVPD providers carrying the channel, are able to access their local feed based on ZIP code, by their IP address via geolocation, or by manual selection, allowing subscribers to access a feed from another city when they travel outside of their home market.|$|E

500|$|Three {{days before}} the {{hurricane}} made its final landfall, officials <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau in Brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the Texas coast, declaring that it was [...] "uncertain where tropical storm in Gulf will reach coast line, but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on Texas coast over week end." [...] The early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the Texas beaches on Labor Day Weekend. As a result, {{an official at the}} Corpus Christi Weather Bureau office estimated that the warning [...] "probably saved thousands of lives." [...] Early on September 4 about a day before landfall, the Weather Bureau issued a hurricane warning from Corpus Christi to Freeport and storm warnings for other locations along the Texas coast. When the storm's westward motion became more apparent, the hurricane warning was dropped north of Corpus Christi and extended southward to Brownsville. Officials in Corpus Christi declared martial law before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas. Shelters opened in the city, and many businesses closed.|$|E

The tugboat Indian, carrying five barges, sank in the James River; {{four of the}} eight crew members drowned. One building was demolished and several others were damaged in Portsmouth. The ferry Princess Anne was beached into the docks at Kiptopeke.

The roof of the Custom house was detached and landed on the street. In Richmond, 200store fronts were damaged, while part of the steeple at Trinity Methodist Church was toppled. Additionally, a [...] microwave tower in Warsaw was knocked over. Approximately 50% of residents in Virginia lost telephone and electrical service for six days. The storm damaged approximately 18,000homes and businesses. Overall, there were 12deaths and about $15million in damage.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} prior to the storm, several forecasters {{declared}} that there was virtually no chance of the hurricane making landfall in Florida. Richard W. Gray, chief meteorologist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau office in Miami, predicted on September12 that the storm would move westward and eventually dissipate over the Yucatán Channel. However, the hurricane instead moved northwestward after striking Puerto Rico. On September14, a newspaper noted that there [...] "seemed to be a tendency toward a curve east-ward," [...] meaning that a landfall in Florida was highly unlikely. A. J. Mitchell of the Jacksonville Weather Bureau office stated that [...] "the storm no longer threatens the lower East Coast of Florida.", while Gray declared it [...] "improbable that it [...] will affect {{the east coast of}} Florida." [...] Mariano Gutiérrez-Lanza of the Jesuit observatory in Belen, Cuba, agreed and noted that Cuba and Florida should not be concerned by the hurricane. However, that same day, a weather report received by a wireless station in Jupiter indicated that Florida would indeed experience [...] "some or all of the storm." ...|$|E

500|$|Abby was {{an unusually}} small storm, with its entire {{circulation}} being {{far less than}} 100mi (160km) in diameter. Around 16:00UTC (11:00a.m. CDT) on August7, reconnaissance measured a central barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) within Abby, the lowest {{in relation to the}} system. They also reported peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) in squalls, which would rank as a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. These winds were seen to be an overestimate by forecasters and discarded, however. The system attained its maximum winds of 65mph (100km/h) by 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT) and subsequently made landfall just northeast of Matagorda, Texas at 22:00UTC (5:00p.m. CDT). Irvin Velbrecht, a forecaster <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau (now known as the National Weather Service) in Galveston, described the storm as a [...] "perfectly miniature hurricane." [...] Despite moving onshore, Abby's core continued to organize and it developed a closed eyewall roughly three hours later. Thereafter the storm began to gradually weaken, passing over Edna around 02:00UTC on August8 (9:00p.m. CDT on August7). Weakening to a depression hours later, Abby ultimately degenerated into an area of showers and dissipated southwest of San Antonio by 12:00UTC (7:00a.m. CDT).|$|E
500|$|Striking Guam as a Category5-equivalent typhoon, Karen {{produced}} destructive winds {{across much}} of the island. With the eye passing over the southern tip of the territory, the most intense winds were felt over central areas. Wind gusts over the southern tip of Guam were estimated to have peaked around 185km/h (115mph). Due to the extreme nature of these winds, all anemometers on the island failed before the most intense portion of the storm arrived, and there were no measurements of the strongest winds; however, post-storm reports estimated that sustained winds reached 250km/h (155mph) in some areas. The highest measured gust was 240km/h (145mph) at a United States Navy anemometer on Nimitz Hill just before 11:00UTC on November11, roughly two hours before the typhoon's eye passed the station. Based on this measurement, a study in 1996 estimated that gusts peaked between 280 and 295km/h (175 and 185mph) over southern areas of the island. Newspaper reports indicated that a gust of [...] was measured on the island before the anemometer was destroyed. There was also an unverified report of a [...] wind gust. Nearly all measurements of rainfall during the typhoon were lost; the only known total is [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau station for the period of November10–12.|$|E
500|$|After {{attaining}} {{this initial}} peak intensity on November 9, Karen weakened somewhat as it gradually curved west-northwestward. By 15:14 UTC, the storm began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle as a larger secondary eyewall, approximately [...] in diameter, started developing. Although the storm's winds failed to drop significantly, Karen's central pressure rose to 919 mb (hPa; 27.14 inHg) during this phase. Accelerating slightly, Karen tracked steadily west-northwestward towards Guam. By November 11, the system had regained a well-defined eye and deepened once more. Between 12:10 and 12:35 UTC on November 11, the [...] wide eye of Karen passed directly over southern Guam. At this time, {{the storm was}} estimated to have had winds of 280 km/h (175 mph), which {{would have made it}} the most intense typhoon to strike the island since 1900. However, years of post-storm analyses have indicated that it may have been somewhat weaker when it passed over Guam. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau station {{at the north end of}} Guam, a pressure of 942.4 mb (hPa; 27.83 inHg) was measured. Farther south at Anderson Air Force Base, 939.7 mb (hPa; 27.75 inHg) was recorded. The lowest verified pressure was 931.9 mb (hPa; 27.52 inHg) at the Agana Naval Air Station. Closest to the eye was Naval Magazine where a pressure of 907.6 mb (hPa; 26.80 inHg) was estimated but never verified.|$|E

500|$|Then little-known newsman Dan Rather {{reported}} {{live from}} {{the second floor of}} a building in Texas City during the storm, an act that would be imitated by later reporters. This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane. Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that [...] "literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes", according to a fellow reporter. Broadcasting live <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau Office in Galveston, Rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic. He then held the map over the black and white radar screen, which put the size of Carla into perspective, saying that Carla was the size of the Gulf of Mexico. CBS was so impressed with Rather's work that he was offered the position of correspondent. Throughout Texas, Carla destroyed 1,915homes, 568farm buildings, and 415other buildings. Additionally, 50,723homes, 5,620farm buildings, and 10,487other buildings suffered damage. There were 460injuries according to the American Red Cross, though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number, 465. The storm caused 34fatalities in Texas. Causes of death include 20people drowning, eight from tornadoes, four electrocutions, and one heart attack. Overall, damage in the state was [...] "conservatively" [...] estimated at $300million. A breakdown of damage indicates $200million incurred to property and $100million to crops, mostly from unharvested rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus.|$|E
500|$|Historical records {{chronicled the}} {{remainder}} of the storm's track along the East Coast of the United States. A [...] "dreadful squall" [...] occurred near Cape Henry at noon, and historical documents confirm it quickly reached Chesapeake Bay later that morning, maintaining west-to-north winds. While gusts in New York City, where the storm arrived that afternoon, initially blew towards the southeast, they soon shifted towards the north-northwest and coincided with a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, which bottomed out at 977mbar (28.87inHg) by the early afternoon. Though the barometer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> station remained at that point for much of the afternoon, the air temperature plummeted rapidly from [...] to [...] during the same period. A strong westerly circulation encouraged the swift eastward movement of the through's northern segment, steering the course of the storm northeasterly over New England. By the evening, the storm had fully traversed the northeastern United States, where accounts indicated the passage of the storm's eye. The results of the 2001study also suggested atypical strengthening occurred around this time, achieving its peak intensity with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) over Massachusetts, equivalent to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The storm's maximum diameter was estimated to be [...] at its largest point. As the hurricane weakened throughout the night, it underwent an extratropical transition, evidenced by a passageway of weak winds off of the trough's center. Its eye was consequently distorted as it meandered northward towards Canada, where it subsequently encountered an area of high pressure; though gusts diminished that evening, moderate precipitation persisted for another two days before the snowstorm finally departed on 11October.|$|E
