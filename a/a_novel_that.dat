In 2000, Chabon published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> John Leonard, in a 2007 review of a later novel, called Chabon's magnum opus.

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

25|$|Because Regeneration is <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> {{focuses on}} the First World War, it explores many of the themes common to {{literature}} written during and following the war, including the cause and effects of war, the limits of ideologies like nationalism and masculinity, and both the medical and popular reactions to the psychological traumas created in the war. Critics have treated each of these extensively. Moreover, because much of Barker's earlier work was historical fiction about women, critics often comment on her treatment {{of women in the}} novel.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Cruikshank felt outraged that Ainsworth would use another illustrator, John Franklin, for <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> Cruikshank stated {{that he wanted to}} pursue. Cruikshank claims that the incident caused him to start the Omnibus. This incident occurred before their partnership with the Ainsworth's Magazine and Cruikshank was still illustrating other works for Ainsworth at the time. There is little evidence to suggest that Cruikshank's chronology of the events or his statements about the motivations behind his earlier actions is correct.|$|E
25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five is also <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> {{focuses on}} the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions {{the fate of the}} situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E

25|$|Godwin {{augmented}} {{the influence}} of Political Justice {{with the publication of}} <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> proved equally popular, Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams. This {{tells the story of a}} servant who finds out a dark secret about Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. Caleb Williams is essentially the first thriller: Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night what took him over a year to write. Not the least of its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin's ingenuity in doing this.|$|E
25|$|During White's time at Cambridge he {{published}} {{a collection of}} poetry entitled The Ploughman and Other Poems, and wrote a play named Bread and Butter Women, which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny Bryant's Playhouse in Sydney. After being admitted {{to the degree of}} Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking Happy Valley, <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for Happy Valley. The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, Nightside, but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} and critical success of Carrie allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. The Demolished Man was <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>that</b> had fascinated De Palma {{since the late}} 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and avant-garde storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, {{and has yet to}} appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's Minority Report bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of The Demolished Man). The result of his experience with adapting The Demolished Man was The Fury, a science fiction psychic thriller that starred Kirk Douglas, Carrie Snodgress, John Cassavetes and Amy Irving. The film was admired by Jean-Luc Godard, who featured a clip in his mammoth Histoire(s) du cinéma, and Pauline Kael who championed both The Fury and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than Carrie, though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as The Untouchables and , the thematic complex thrillers for which he is now better known.|$|E
