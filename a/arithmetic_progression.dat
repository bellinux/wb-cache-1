25|$|Other than a {{treatise}} on squares in <b>arithmetic</b> <b>progression</b> by Fibonacci — who lived and studied in north Africa and Constantinople during his formative years, ca. 1175–1200 — no number theory {{to speak of}} was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study {{of the works of}} Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus's Arithmetica (Bachet, 1621, following a first attempt by Xylander, 1575).|$|E
25|$|In 1225, Fibonacci was {{challenged}} {{to find a}} construction for triples of square numbers that are equally spaced from each other, forming an <b>arithmetic</b> <b>progression,</b> and for the spacing between these numbers, which he called a congruum. One way of describing Fibonacci's solution is that the numbers to be squared are the difference of legs, hypotenuse, and sum of legs of a Pythagorean triangle, and that the congruum is four times {{the area of the}} same triangle. In his later work on the congruum problem, published in The Book of Squares, Fibonacci observed that it is impossible for a congruum to be a square number itself, but did not present a satisfactory proof of this fact.|$|E

500|$|Invention of the {{function}} now known as natural logarithm began {{as an attempt to}} perform a quadrature of a rectangular hyperbola by Gregoire de Saint Vincent, a Belgian Jesuit residing in Prague.
