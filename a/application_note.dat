25|$|The {{capacitive}} shunt method, described in an <b>application</b> <b>note</b> by Analog Devices, senses {{the change in}} capacitance between a transmitter and receiver that are {{on opposite sides of}} the sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200–300kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the RiscPC in 1994 and its later StrongARM upgrade raised issues of incompatible code sequences and proprietary squeezing (compression). Patching of applications for the StrongARM was facilitated and Acorn's UnsqueezeAIF software unsqueezed images according to their AIF header. The incompatibilities prompted release by The ARM Club of its Game On! and StrongGuard software. They allowed some previously incompatible software to be run on new and upgraded systems. The version of the OS for the A9home prevented the running of software without an AIF header (in accordance with <b>Application</b> <b>Note</b> 295) to stop [...] "trashing the desktop".|$|E
