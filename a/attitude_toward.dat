The present conceptualization of individual differences in <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> emotions focuses on specific emotions and presents data indicating that 5 emotions (anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust) load on 5 separate attitude factors (Study 1). <b>Attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> emotions predicted emotional situation selection (Study 2).

Additionally, the Sex Role Egalitarianism scale was used to determine the influence of gender role expectation on <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> these groups. Degree of interpersonal contact with homosexuals was assessed and analyzed relative to its 2 ̆ 7 influence on <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> lesbians, gay men, and homosexuals in general. Finally, parent educational attainment and self-reported grade point average were considered relative to participants 2 ̆ 7 <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> homosexual persons. ^ The results of this study support previous research indicating that males maintain more negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> homosexuals than females; and that males 2 ̆ 7 <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> gay men are significantly more negative than their <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> lesbians, while females 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards gay men and lesbians are essentially equivalent. Gender role expectation was significantly related to <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> lesbians and gay men for both sexes, and degree of sex role egalitarianism was found to moderate the differences in <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> gay men and lesbians that were observed between males and females. Notably for females, sex role egalitarianism was a significantly stronger moderator of <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> homosexuals than for males. Results of this study also lend further support to existing research on the relationship between prior interpersonal contact with homosexuals and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> this group insofar as prior contact with homosexuals was related to more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> gay men and lesbians. Neither parent educational attainment nor participant grade point average were significantly related to <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> lesbians or gay men in this research.

Predictors of <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders may facilitate better understanding of recidivism rates among sex offenders and may aid professionals who work with sex offenders, such as probation and parole officers. Hypotheses were that Religiosity would be negatively correlated with <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders and BJW would be positively correlated with <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders. Responses from 252 participants were collected using a Qualtrics survey. The order of the surveys was randomized. There was no significant correlation between Religiosity and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders. BJW and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders were significantly positively correlated, possibly because <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders differ between survey conditions. It is possible that <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sex offenders are influenced by the measurement in the same study of <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> other groups, such as victims of sex offenses.

40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} were to examine {{unfavorable}} <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> receiving methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) and associated factors among inmates using intravenous heroin in Taiwan. A total of 315 inmates using intravenous heroin were recruited.

The associations of unfavorable <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> receiving MMT with sociodemographic and drug-using characteristics, human immunodeficiency virus serostatus, perceived family support, and depression were examined using multiple regression analysis. The results {{of this study}} showed that the mean score of unfavorable <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> receiving MMT, determined on the Client <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Toward</b> Methadone Programs Scale, was 9. 918 (standard deviation= 2. 277, range= 5 – 20).
