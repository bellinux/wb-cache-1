5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E

40|$|Reaching {{with the}} <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{grasping}} {{with the hand}} and fingers is a complex behavior that appears in utero, is elaborated over {{the first few years}} of life, and serves useful everyday functions throughout the course of human life. Several neurological condi-tions can impair the ability to produce <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand movements and so greatly impact on the quality of life and well-being of the affected individuals. Given the fundamental role that <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand movements play in everyday life, deficits related to <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand function are one of the most debilitating motor conditions. Neurological conditions that can affect <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand movements include autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and stroke-related motor cortex damage as well as spinal cord injury at cervical levels.

5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E

This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
