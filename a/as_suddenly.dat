5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E

25|$|For all {{the quiet}} charm and erudition of his paintings, Alma-Tadema himself {{preserved}} a youthful sense of mischief. He was childlike in his practical jokes {{and in his}} sudden bursts of bad temper, which could <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> subside into an engaging smile.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{report of}} a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded {{up and down the}} aisle, as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as it had appeared.|$|E
25|$|During the 'celebrations' a Norse fleet led by Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, {{appeared}} off {{the coast}} at Puffin Island, and in battle that followed, known as the Battle of Anglesey Sound, Magnus shot dead the earl of Shrewsbury with an arrow to the eye. The Norse left <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> and as mysteriously as they had arrived, however leaving the Norman army weakened and demoralized.|$|E

25|$|A deimatic {{displays}} is {{a pattern}} of threatening or startling behaviour, such <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, {{such as those of}} genus Speiredonia, or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus Spirama. Adult Atlas moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia also display snake heads. The eyed hawkmoth displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly {{as if it were a}} vertebrate predator such as an owl.|$|E
25|$|The story then {{follows the}} doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” {{as they attempt}} to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The {{breakdown}} of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> and inexplicably as it struck.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>suddenly</b> as they appeared, the {{tourists}} vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but {{the tourists}} reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E
500|$|Deimatic behaviour, threat display, or startle {{display in}} animals means any pattern of behaviour, such <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{displaying}} conspicuous eyespots, to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal {{an opportunity to}} escape. The term deimatic or dymantic originates from the Greek δειματόω (deimatόo), meaning [...] "to frighten".|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{suddenly}} in 1794 and disappearing just <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic Sharaku are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized {{the differences between}} the actor and the portrayed character. [...] The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro. [...] Published by Tsutaya, Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown. [...] Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Pinker, with Paul Bloom, {{published}} the paper [...] "Natural Language and Natural Selection", {{arguing that the}} human language faculty must have evolved through natural selection. The article provided arguments for a continuity based view of language evolution, contrary to then current discontinuity based theories that see language <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> appearing {{with the advent of}} Homo sapiens as a kind of evolutionary accident. This discontinuity based view was prominently argued by two of the main authorities, linguist Noam Chomsky and Stephen Jay Gould. The paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in the evolutionary prehistory of language, and has been credited with shifting the central question of the debate from [...] "did language evolve?" [...] to [...] "how did language evolve". The article also presaged Pinker's argument in The Language Instinct.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} no factors {{inhibiting}} the development of Celia, the storm unexpectedly weakened again later on June23. The storm's eye rapidly dissipated and the central dense overcast became asymmetric. Forecaster Todd Kimberlain at the NHC referred to the unexplained shifts in strength as [...] "puzzling." [...] However, <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as the weakening took place, strengthening ensued. Very strong convection formed over {{the center of the}} storm, with some cloud tops being as cold as , but no eye had reformed by the morning of June24. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized, with the eye fully reforming and the structure becoming more symmetrical. Rapid intensification soon followed as the storm reached Category4 status, becoming {{one of only a handful}} of tropical cyclones to do so during the month of June in the eastern Pacific. That evening, the storm further intensified into a Category5 hurricane, the second storm to reach this strength during June in the Eastern Pacific basin on record. Hurricane Celia attained its peak intensity around 0000UTC, with sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). The storm also displayed a well-defined eye estimated to be [...] in diameter.|$|E
