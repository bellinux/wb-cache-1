50|$|A typical {{test setup}} {{includes}} a load machine, clutch and torque transducer. An externally applied load {{is used to}} strain, i.e., load, the motor. Using this method, simple characteristics can be directly mechanically acquired and the derived variables calculated. From the input current and input voltage, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> can also be recorded. Similarly, from the rpm and torque output values, the mechanical power output can be determined, and thus, {{the efficiency of the}} motor.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic active {{suspension}} uses linear electromagnetic motors attached to each wheel. It provides extremely fast response, and allows regeneration of power consumed, {{by using the}} motors as generators. This nearly surmounts the issues of slow response times and high power consumption of hydraulic systems. Electronically controlled {{active suspension}} system (ECASS) technology was patented by the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics in the 1990s and has been developed by L-3 Electronic Systems for use on military vehicles. The ECASS-equipped HMMWV exceeded the performance specifications for all performance evaluations in terms of <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> to the vehicle operator, stability and handling.|$|E

50|$|Hercules {{becomes a}} {{founding}} member of the superhero team the Champions, aiding the mortal heroes against the machinations of Olympians Pluto and Hippolyta. The character appears during the Korvac saga, and after being kidnapped by the Elder of the Universe the Collector is freed (with the other Avengers) by comrade Hawkeye to battle the cosmic entity Korvac who has <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> from Galactus's ship, giving him god-like power, and traveled from the 31st century to remake the Universe. Although killed in battle, Hercules and many of the Avengers are resurrected by the entity before dying. Hercules also appears in a humorous story with Fantastic Four member the Thing.|$|E
5000|$|Assuming {{the star}} radiates isotropically {{and that the}} planet {{is a long way}} from the star, the power absorbed by the planet is given by {{treating}} the planet as a disc of radius , which intercepts some of the power which is spread over the surface of a sphere of radius [...] (the distance of the planet from the star). The calculation assumes the planet reflects some of the incoming radiation by incorporating a parameter called the albedo (a). An albedo of 1 means that all the radiation is reflected, an albedo of 0 means all of it is absorbed. The expression for <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> is then: ...|$|E

5000|$|Rogue, or Marian, {{originally}} drains life-force {{and memories}} on skin contact. She is abducted into the Weapon X program under unknown circumstances. Like her mainstream counterpart, she can <b>absorb</b> mutant <b>powers.</b> When she is liberated, she first joins the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, then defects to the X-Men, then leaves {{the team in}} the company of Gambit after her boyfriend Bobby Drake cheats on her with Kitty Pryde. After <b>absorbing</b> his <b>powers,</b> which last {{for an extended period of}} time, during a battle with Juggernaut (in which Gambit dies), she inherits his energy-charging powers. This negates her <b>absorbing</b> <b>power</b> and she becomes able to touch people without draining their abilities or memories as shown when she and her ex-boyfriend, Iceman, have sex in the [...] "Date Night" [...] arc. These powers have since faded, leaving her with her previous <b>absorbing</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Infamous Second Son was {{released}} on March 21, 2014, based 7 years after {{the events of the}} second installment. This focuses on a new character, Delsin Rowe, who is a graffiti artist and we follow him with his <b>power</b> of <b>absorbing</b> <b>power</b> from other prime conduits. After his initial meeting with Henry 'Hank' Daughtry early in the story, he <b>absorbs</b> Hank's <b>power</b> which is smoke and fire.|$|R
50|$|In {{this type}} the ferrite absorbs {{energy from the}} {{microwave}} signal travelling in one direction. A suitable rotating magnetic field {{is found in the}} TE10 mode of rectangular waveguide. The rotating field exists away from the centre-line of the broad wall, over the full height of the guide. However, to allow heat from the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> to be conducted away, the ferrite does not usually extend from one broad-wall to the other, but is limited to a shallow strip on each face. For a given bias field, resonance absorption occurs over a fairly narrow frequency band, but since in practice the bias field is not perfectly uniform throughout the ferrite, the isolator functions over a somewhat wider band.|$|E
50|$|To {{circumvent}} Zeus' decree, Pluto {{attempts to}} conquer Earth {{with the help}} of Lorelei. Pluto transforms Lorelei into a copy of the Valkyrie and drains her of her power and memories. He then uses the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> {{to take control of the}} real Valkyrie to turn Earth into a realm of the dead itself. The Valkyrie's presence masks his own influence and Zeus' decree still allows Pluto to annex other realms of the dead. Pluto is eventually stopped by the Defenders who bring Lorelei along, thinking her to be their teammate. The clash of the two Valkyries releases Lorelei from the spell and together they turned on Pluto and ended his plan.|$|E
50|$|Hitschler is {{interested}} in science and material culture as well as art. Her environmental installation Energy field (1999) reflects all three concerns. It was created {{on top of a}} potash slag heap in Hannover-Empelde, Germany. The area was closed in 1972 and slated for reclamation. In 1999, it was opened to artists for an exhibition project. For her installation, Hitschler created 400 light-emitting diodes, which used ongoing chemical processes within the potash heap as a power source. Each diode rested atop two 40 cm long and 2 mm thin brass tubes. The tubes were connected with magnesium, copper and zinc. Galvanic cells <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> from the hill to turn on the light. The tiny red diodes were placed in a sixteen-square meter area. Video and photographs documenting the installation have been shown nationally and internationally in exhibits such as Elemental Matters, 2011, at the Chemical Heritage Foundation.|$|E

50|$|Clyde is {{the only}} mutant of his home world and is capable of reality {{manipulation}} on a massive scale. (For example he made Sun scream in terror before making it explode) He is immortal {{and is able to}} open portals to other dimensions/realities, time travel, resurrect the dead, manipulate and transmutate matter, shapeshift, teleport himself and others, generate massive amounts of energy, can project telepathic illusions into minds of others (he was able to create illusion of five years in Doctor Doom's mind during less than five seconds), mind control high-level cosmic entities and gods such as Galactus, Thanos, Odin and Eternity to do his bidding and as Marquis of Death can destroy universes.He is also highly durable as it took planck temperature to defeat Marquis of Death after he was severely weakened from fighting with present Clyde Wyncham and Fantastic Four who <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> of thousands alternate versions of Fantastic Four.|$|E
50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{consists of}} an absorptive element, such as {{a thin layer of}} metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir - the greater the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power,</b> the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the absorptive element itself {{can be used as a}} thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Peter goes to see Mohinder Suresh but Sylar attacks him upon arrival. Fighting him off, Peter becomes invisible, but Sylar foils {{the attempt}} at evasion by {{spraying}} glass shards everywhere, {{one of which}} strikes Peter {{in the back of}} the head, killing him. Suresh manages to knock Sylar out for a while and takes Peter's body to Nathan's home. Everyone believes him to be dead, but Claire, drawing from her own near death experience, finds and removes the glass in the back of Peter's head, allowing him to recover.Believing that he will be the one to cause the catastrophe, he tries to convince Claire to stay, as her ability will allow her to get close enough to stop him from exploding. The moment Peter comes in range of Ted, Peter's hands begin to glow, but Peter barely manages to rein in the newly <b>absorbed</b> <b>power.</b> They decide to leave the city immediately and thwart the foreseen catastrophe, but the FBI captures Ted. Sylar attacks the transport vehicle carrying him and steals Ted's power, killing him. Realizing that Sylar now has Ted's power, Peter assumes that Sylar, not him, will cause the explosion.|$|E

He is very fickle, {{pursuing}} girls then losing interest and back to being interested again. He has a fear of Magneto and is often seen eating or playing video games. Recently, he rekindled his relationship with Rogue when her <b>absorbing</b> <b>powers</b> were halted after she <b>absorbed</b> Gambit's <b>powers</b> {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|R
30|$|First load level. The VRB {{energy storage}} system acts as a dynamic load to <b>absorb</b> <b>power</b> from the system. The {{theoretical}} value of KVRB is −[*] 0.433 and the fitting effect of the 20 % voltage drop under this load level is shown in Fig.  12.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that in this case the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> at given voltage is {{influenced}} by the change in gas mixture. Higher nitrogen admixture reduces the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> leading to the peculiar maximum of the atomic nitrogen density. However, the trends inside a specific figure in this study remain true, since the change due to purification is only a minor change in the absolute gas mixture and has consequently a minor influence on the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> [35].|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} of <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> as an objective ride measure to the subjective evaluation {{for the bus}} data was investigated. For some individual bus rides the correlations were poor, but when {{a sufficient number of}} rides was used to give reasonable sample base, an excellent correlation was obtained. The following logarithmical function was derived: S = 1. 7245 1 n (39. 6849 AP), where S = one subjective rating of the ride; and AP = the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> in watts. A six-degree-of-freedom method developed for aircraft data was completed. Preliminary {{correlation of}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> with ISO standards further enhances the bus ride and <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> correlation numbers since the AP's obtained are of the same order of magnitude for both correlations. While it would then appear that one could just use ISO standards, {{there is no way to}} add the effect of three degrees of freedom. The <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> provides a method of adding the effects due to the three major directions plus the pitch and roll...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor the {{purposes}} of new product development, the cycling industry requires an objective means of ranking bicycle comfort with regard to vibration response. Acceleration is currently the standard metric used in the industry. <b>Absorbed</b> <b>power</b> and transmitted force have recently been proposed as metrics to quantify bicycle comfort. The objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the relative merits of these 3 metrics. Measurements were done while comparing 2 bikes tested on a cobblestone road and on a laboratory simulator. Acceleration and <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> give the same anticipated results but the <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> has several advantages over the other metrics...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, owing {{probably}} to the <b>absorbing</b> <b>powers</b> of the forbidden subject, {{there were moments}} when it seemed that a pause was impending, and Mr. Ormsby, an old hand, seized one of these critical instants to address a good-natured question to Coningsby, whose acquaintance he had already cultivated by taking wine with him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1858, Balfour Stewart {{described}} his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, {{compared with the}} powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature. Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of Pierre Prevost and of John Leslie. He wrote [...] "Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible <b>absorbing</b> <b>power,</b> will possess also the greatest possible radiating power." [...] More an experimenter than a logician, Stewart failed {{to point out that}} his statement presupposed an abstract general principle, that there exist either ideally in theory or really in nature bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible <b>absorbing</b> <b>power,</b> likewise for radiating power, for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature.|$|R
