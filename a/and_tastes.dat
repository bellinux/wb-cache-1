5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents <b>and</b> <b>tastes,</b> and that in a university such hypotheses {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|Incorporating dubstep and UK garage styles, Jamie xx applied {{electronic}} music techniques in his production to remix Scott-Heron's vocals {{from the original}} album over his own instrumentals. Although it is structured similarly, We're New Here eschews the original album's stark style and lo-fi production for bass-driven, musically varied production and sonical illumination of Scott-Heron's vocals. It has been noted by music writers for recontextualizing Scott-Heron's narratives in Jamie xx's own musical influences <b>and</b> <b>tastes.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions <b>and</b> <b>tastes.</b> Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> somewhat like coconut.|$|E
5|$|Toyota {{researchers}} {{visited the}} U.S. in May 1985 to conduct {{focus groups and}} market research on luxury consumers. During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads. Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan, and plans were made {{to develop a new}} network of dealerships in the U.S. market.|$|E
40|$|Epithelial {{tissue of}} {{vertebrate}} organisms {{serves as the}} interface {{between them and the}} immediate environment with which they interact. Transformation of this outer tissue layer generates specialized structures that allow organisms to make enhanced or entirely new interactions with its ecological niche. This study examines two structures derived from the oropharyngeal cavity epithelium: teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds. Using cichlids from Lake Malawi in eastern Africa as a model, this study seeks to show the co-evolutionary relationship that likely exists between teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds. Based on the observations that both teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds are derived from the epithelium, are colocalized sensory organs within the oropharyngeal cavity, have very similar structures in early development, and share certain patterns in gene expression, we hypothesize that the gene networks governing tooth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> bud development are similar. Through comparative morphology and molecular developmental biology, this study shows that both teeth <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> buds share similarities of gene expression in both spatial and temporal patterns.

40|$|During flights, reduced odor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> {{perception}} is reported. Passengers tend to prefer spicier meals {{than on the}} ground. The conditions on board were simulated at the Fraunhofer flight test facility in Holzkirchen, Germany, consisting of a front fuselage of an Airbus A 310 - 200 in a huge metal tube in which all relevant parameters can be adjusted (humidity, temperature, pressure). Flight tests were carried out at low atmospheric pressure corresponding to cabin conditions on board at cruising altitude and were repeated at normal atmospheric pressure corresponding to ground conditions. All other parameters were kept constant. Under these conditions, test persons smelled <b>and</b> <b>tasted</b> food-safe flavorants to evaluate the mean odor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> thresholds <b>and</b> <b>tasted</b> different flavored food. Even tomato juice and various wines were <b>tasted</b> for odor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> qualities, intensities <b>and</b> individual preferences. At low pressure conditions, higher <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odor thresholds of flavorants were generally observed with few exceptions. Salt, sugar, glutamate and most odorant thresholds increased clearly. Organic acids and some bitter tastants showed no change. Transferred to complete meals, more salt, sugar and herbs were necessary on board to serve meals that tasted {{similar to the way}} they did on the ground. Sour ingredients had to be reduced. The odor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> spectrum of the beverages investigated changed in various ways. Light and fresh flavors decreased, whereas intensive flavors persisted...|$|R
5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, {{and both the}} British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas <b>and</b> <b>tastes.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{three hundred}} years, Belton House was {{the seat of}} the Brownlow and Cust family, who had first {{acquired}} land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary Baroque palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from baronets to barons upward to earls and then once again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position <b>and</b> <b>tastes,</b> yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu {{claimed that}} the {{perception}} of consumption {{can be seen as}} self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes <b>and</b> <b>tastes.</b> These likes <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.|$|E

25|$|Many Singaporean Chinese {{dishes were}} adapted by early Chinese {{immigrants}} to suit local circumstances (such as available ingredients) and cannot strictly be considered mainstream Chinese cuisine.

In the case of acetic acid, all three attributes (odor, taste, flavor) varied with concentration in approximately the same way. Flavor fell slightly, but uniformly, below the sum of odor magnitude <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude. In the case of coffee, flavor <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude grew relatively rapidly and odor relatively slowly with concentration. Nevertheless, flavor again fell uniformly below the sum of odor magnitude <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> magnitude. A vector summation model previously applied with success to odor mixtures provided a very adequate description of {{the relation between}} flavor and its constituents. The applicability of the model in the present instance implies that neither taste nor smell contributes to flavor {{at the expense of the}} other...|$|R

25|$|Although Poe {{wrote this}} short story before the {{invention}} of modern psychological science, Roderick's condition can be described according to its terminology. It includes a form of sensory overload known as hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to textures, light, sounds, smells <b>and</b> <b>tastes),</b> hypochondria (an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness) and acute anxiety. It is revealed that Roderick's twin sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls into cataleptic, deathlike trances. Roderick and Madeline are the only remaining members of the Usher family.|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{represent}} the largest family of transmembrane receptors and are prime therapeutic targets. The odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors account for {{over half of}} the GPCR repertoire, yet they are generally excluded from large-scale, drug candidate analyses. Accumulating molecular evidence indicates that the odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors are widely expressed throughout the body and functional beyond the oronasal cavity - with roles including nutrient sensing, autophagy, muscle regeneration, regulation of gut motility, protective airway reflexes, bronchodilation, and respiratory disease. Given this expanding array of actions, the restricted perception of these GPCRs as mere mediators of smell <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> is outdated. Moreover, delineation of the precise actions of odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> GPCRs continues to be hampered by the relative paucity of selective and specific experimental tools, as well as the lack of defined receptor pharmacology. In this review, we summarize the evidence for expression and function of odorant <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors in tissues beyond the nose and mouth, and we highlight their broad potential in physiology and pathophysiology...|$|R

25|$|During the British {{colonial era}} from 1700–1912, Kolkata enjoyed the {{privilege}} of being the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design.
