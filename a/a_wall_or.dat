5|$|The low-key {{lighting}} schemes of many classic film noirs {{are associated with}} stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>or</b> an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>or</b> cingulum, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> wing <b>wall</b> (also [...] "wingwall" [...] or [...] "wing-wall") is <b>a</b> smaller <b>wall</b> {{attached}} <b>or</b> next to <b>a</b> larger <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> structure.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> green <b>wall</b> is <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> {{partially}} <b>or</b> {{completely covered}} with greenery {{that includes a}} growing medium, such as soil or a substrate. Most green <b>walls</b> also feature <b>an</b> integrated water delivery system. <b>A</b> green <b>wall</b> {{is also known as}} <b>a</b> living <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> vertical garden. It provides insulation to keep the building's inside temperature consistent.|$|R

25|$|When placed {{close to}} <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> {{touching}} it, altars were often surmounted by a reredos or altarpiece. If free-standing, {{they could be}} placed, as also in Eastern Christianity, within a ciborium (sometimes called a baldachin).|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the harbour was a fish trap; <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> dyke running across part of the upper portion of the inlet which trapped fish as the tide went out. This was still marked {{as late as the}} 1850s on the OS map.|$|E
25|$|The {{tidal bore}} – <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> undulating wave of water moves {{upstream}} against water flowing downstream {{as shown in}} Figures 3 and 4. If considered from a frame of reference which moves with the wave front, {{you can see that}} this case is physically similar to a stationary jump.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> spite <b>wall,</b> <b>or</b> blinder <b>wall,</b> {{similar in}} concept to a spite house or spite fence, is <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> {{constructed}} <b>or</b> substantially modified to irritate neighbors or any party with land stakes. <b>A</b> spite <b>wall</b> may create obstructions, such as blocking out light or blocking visibility over a neighbouring property or blocking access to neighbouring buildings, {{or can be}} flagrant symbols of defiance (built out of spite). Also called <b>a</b> blinder <b>wall,</b> as in to blind the view of a neighbour.|$|R

25|$|A related case is {{a cascade}} – <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> undulating wave of water moves {{downstream}} overtaking a shallower downstream flow of water as shown in Figure 5. If considered from a frame of reference which moves with the wave front, this is amenable to the same analysis as a stationary jump.|$|E
25|$|A {{glory hole}} (also spelled gloryhole and glory-hole) is {{a hole in}} <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>or</b> other partition, often between public {{lavatory}} stalls or adult video arcade booths, for people to engage in sexual activity or observe {{the person in the}} next cubicle while one or both parties masturbate. In addition to the penis, fingers or the tongue may be inserted into the hole.|$|E
25|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous {{for the reason that}} the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.|$|E

25|$|Running from Anderson's Plantation {{across the}} hill and {{back down to the}} old {{driveway}} near to the walled garden is <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> dyke replacing a tree lined hedge shown in 1858. The wall or dyke is very unusual in that it is made from roughly equal sized rounded whinstones and it is held together by cement. A great deal of expense and effort would have been needed to build this long section of dyke, which seems to have been in place by 1911.|$|E
25|$|The feudal {{allocation}} of tenements to the vassals of the overlord, such as Hugh de Morville, {{was carried out}} very carefully, with the boundaries being walked and carefully recorded. The term 'ton' at this time {{was added to the}} site of the dwelling house, not necessarily a grand stone-built structure, which was bounded by <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> fence. The tenements were held in a military tenure, the land being in exchange for military assistance to the overlord. In later years the military assistance could be exchanged for financial payment.|$|E
25|$|Closest to {{the enemy}} are several lines of {{anti-tank}} obstacles and minefields. Usually it means a V or U-trench and <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> dragon’s teeth row, while moats, hedgehogs and berms have been used very rarely because they are difficult to be camouflaged. Behind this lies an extensive, at least 30-meter-wide anti-infantry entanglement, which is a mixed system of apron fences, wire concertinas, electric fences, traps, mines, nail spikes and spike pits. Both elements are well camouflaged by good location (relief) and by plants (e.g. small height bushes in front of ditches).|$|E

25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 17th century, almost all new Latin-rite altars were built against <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> backed by a reredos, with a {{tabernacle}} placed on the altar or inserted into the reredos. This meant that the priest turned to the people, putting his back to the altar, only for a few short moments at Mass. However, the Tridentine Missal itself speaks of celebrating versus populum, and gives corresponding instructions for the priest when performing actions that in the other orientation involved turning around in order to face the people.|$|E
25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be {{bathed in a}} green light {{whenever}} he used his power, such as passing through <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do {{a variety of things}} such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E
25|$|The Barony was {{originally}} {{held by the}} powerful De Morville family. The feudal allocation of tenements to the vassals of De Morville was carried out very carefully, with the boundaries being walked and recorded.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{load-bearing}} <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> bearing <b>wall</b> is <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> {{that bears}} {{the weight of}} the house above said wall, resting upon it by conducting its weight to a foundation structure.

25|$|Moisture may ascend into a {{building}} from the foundation of <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> gain ingress into {{a building}} from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result {{of this process is}} called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E
25|$|Frescography is {{a method}} for reproduction/creation of murals using digital {{printing}} methods, invented in 1998 by Rainer Maria Latzke, and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. CAM software programs then allow to enter the measurements of <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> ceiling to create a mural design with low resolution motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural. Once a design is finished, the low resolution motifs are converted into the original high resolution images and are printed on canvas by Wide-format printers. The canvas then {{can be applied to}} the wall in a wall-paperhanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.|$|E
25|$|Atomix {{takes place}} on a playfield, {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms must be arranged into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed {{on the left side of}} the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>or</b> another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>wall</b> footing <b>or</b> {{strip footing}} is a {{continuous}} strip of concrete that serves {{to spread the}} weight of <b>a</b> load-bearing <b>wall</b> across <b>an</b> area of soil. It is the component of a shallow foundation.|$|R
