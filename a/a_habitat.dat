5|$|<b>A</b> <b>habitat</b> {{is made up}} of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. <b>A</b> <b>habitat</b> is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|The North Ronaldsay sheep is {{an unusual}} breed of domesticated animal, {{subsisting}} largely on a diet of seaweed, since they are confined to the foreshore {{for most of the}} year to conserve the limited grazing inland.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>habitat</b> is an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E
5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek. The creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2013, it received <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> assessment score of 159 {{on a scale of}} 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates <b>a</b> <b>habitat</b> for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E

5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts.
