5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken. Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story</b> about {{the birth of a}} white buffalo calf, feeling that the image was so potent he did not mind that it did not entirely fit with the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode.|$|E
5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story</b> about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built at a site formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} another major drop for the Dow on October 13, 1989—the Mini-Crash of 1989. The crash was {{apparently}} caused by a reaction to <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story</b> of a $6.75billion leveraged buyout deal for UAL Corporation, {{the parent company of}} United Airlines, which broke down. When the UAL deal fell through, it helped trigger the collapse of the junk bond market causing the Dow to fall 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent.|$|E
25|$|While Furtwängler was travelling, the Berlin {{branch of}} the Associated Press leaked <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story</b> on Hermann Göring's orders. It {{suggested}} Furtwängler would probably be reappointed {{as director of the}} Berlin State Opera and of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. This caused the mood in New York to turn against him: it seemed that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the Nazi Party. On reading the American press reaction, Furtwängler chose not to accept the position in New York. Nor did he accept any position at the Berlin Opera.|$|E

25|$|On most feeds of BBC World News, {{when there}} are no {{commercials}} being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story</b> that has not been promoted airs during what would be the commercial break. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the United States on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.|$|E
25|$|An unintentional denial-of-service {{can occur}} when a system ends up denied, {{not due to}} a {{deliberate}} attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story.</b> The result is that {{a significant proportion of}} the primary site's regular userspotentially hundreds of thousands of peopleclick that link {{in the space of a}} few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack.

25|$|Photojournalism is a {{particular}} form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story.</b> It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, {{but in some cases}} the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, a report by the Australian Communications and Media Authority was {{compiled}} {{a few days after the}} incident. The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and Internet content regulations tightened. It was found that Big Brother itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the Internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested. Rival network current affairs programs A Current Affair on the Nine Network, and the Seven Network's Today Tonight, both broadcast the footage in full. Neither show faced a reprimand from ACMA as they can argue the footage was used as part of <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>story.</b> Presenting the ACMA report, Communications Minister Helen Coonan said that legislation to broaden the authority's regulatory powers to cover the Internet and mobile phone broadcasts, would be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible.|$|E

The English lyrics are broken up by the Xhosa phrase [...] "Yila Moja" [...] (also transliterated [...] "Yehla Moya") meaning [...] "Come Spirit": the phrase has been read as a call to Biko's spirit to join the {{resistance}} movement, and as a suggestion that though Biko was dead, his spirit was still alive.|$|E
