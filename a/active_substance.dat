5|$|There {{was also}} a {{misconception}} about the intoxicating effects of hemp because {{it has the same}} <b>active</b> <b>substance,</b> THC, which is in all cannabis strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930s, THC was not yet fully identified. The methods FBN used for predicting the psychoactive effect of different samples of cannabis and hemp therefore gave confusing results.|$|E

30|$|Discussion It {{could be}} shown which <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are applied in Switzerland in {{substantial}} amounts. Although close to 300 <b>active</b> biocidal <b>substances</b> are used, only about 30 substances {{are employed in}} relevant amounts of more than 5000 [*]kg per year. For 22 <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> with low biodegradability, a potential environmental risk for natural surface waters can be inferred. These <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are used at amounts comparable to the pesticides.|$|R
30|$|Information on the {{investigated}} {{treated articles}} and <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> {{is given in}} Tables  1 and 2. The paints were all waterborne and either based on acrylates (paint A and C) or polymer dispersions (paint B). Paints A and B are the paints for wood, whereas paint C is a roof paint. Mixtures of <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were added to commercially available paints by producers {{according to the requirements}} of this study. Therefore, liquid formulations were used although a number of modern paints now contain microencapsulated <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> The textile was treated in an industrial procedure by the producer using an impregnation material that contains biocides. The contents of the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were confirmed by chemical analysis of the product.|$|R

25|$|Tritium is the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in {{self-powered}} {{lighting and}} controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including autoradiography and radioactive labeling. It {{is also used}} in nuclear weapon design for boosted fission weapons and initiators. Some tritium is created in heavy water moderated reactors when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small cross-section (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.|$|E

30|$|Among all the {{reviewed}} literature, 39 different <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> of VMPs {{were found}} in manure. Moreover, 11 metabolites and transformation products of <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were identified. For this, 1568 manure samples were analyzed within the 27 publications. Mainly, the samples were analyzed for sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. None of the studies worked with a non-target approach or searched for biocides. By far, the most frequently found single <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are sulfadimidine (599 positive), tetracycline (575 positive), and chlortetracycline (457 positive). There are six publications each of which analyzed more than 100 manure samples. All of these are from Chinese or German institutes. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> with {{the highest percentage of}} positive findings (> 50  %) within these six publications are chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, and sulfadimidine.|$|R
25|$|Functional assays, i.e. an assay {{that tries}} to {{quantify}} functioning of an <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding exogenous formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) & VWF (usually endogenous).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) (PB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious pest in {{rapeseed}} cultivations in Poland and in other Eu-ropean countries. The pest is known because of its high metabolic potency towards various toxins. Constant and strong selective pressure of different insecticides used to control this pest, has resulted in resistance of PB to many <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> In connection with this situation, constant monitoring of pollen beetle susceptibility level to all recommended <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> of insecticides is necessary. The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> most often used in Western Poland for PB control. Resistance of pollen beetle to some pyrethroid <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and organophosphorous insecticide – phosalone and high susceptibility to chlorpyrifos-ethyl was found.
