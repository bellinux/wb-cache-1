5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA {{and perhaps a}} few other places the pressure is measured in {{pounds per square inch}} (psi), {{and the rest of the}} world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> underwater.|$|E

5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{fears of}} a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the {{previous}} year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> these shelters. On Oahu, a power outage was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. Jellyfish also stung 50 people. Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage {{on the north side}} of the island. On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage was minimal. Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. In a separate shipping incident, three crewmen were slightly injured. The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. Throughout the state, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|During World War Two, Destroyers served {{three basic}} functions: first, {{to act as}} {{screening}} ships to defend their fleets from enemy fleets, second, to attack the screening ships of enemy fleets, and third, to defend their fleet from submarines. How the destroyers were <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> varied upon the country. Germany abandoned the third function almost entirely, which showed in German destroyers' lack of strong anti-submarine armament, preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re-fitted as minelayers. The role of the destroyer began to vary much more heavily as WW2 progressed; where the British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes, and sinking submarines, the Germans had destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did not attack Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a formal agreement, which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate interlocutor. Goyeneche agreed to sign an armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with the truce still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared the truce broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|E
5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{similarities}} between Ernő and Auric: both were Jewish immigrants {{who came to}} Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists, although they were physically very different. The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London {{with a list of}} queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never <b>actually</b> <b>used</b> it. In 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E
