It passes upward behind the temporomandibular articulation, enters the tympanic cavity through the petrotympanic fissure, and ramifies upon the tympanic membrane, forming a vascular circle around the membrane with the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular, and anastomosing with the artery of the pterygoid canal and with the caroticotympanic branch from the internal carotid.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{three-dimensional}} images of the arterial supply to the temporomandibular joint. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (five men and five women, mean age 36 years) without signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders, who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning with intravenous contrast, were studied. The direct volume rendering technique of CT images was used, and a data set of images to visualize the vasculature of the human temporomandibular joint in three dimensions was created. After elaboration of the data through post-processing, the arterial supply of the temporomandibular joint was studied. Results: The analysis revealed the superficial temporal artery, the <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>artery,</b> the deep temporal artery, the auricular posterior artery, the transverse facial artery, the middle meningeal artery, and the maxillary artery with their branches as the main arterial sources for the lateral and medial temporomandibular joint. Conclusion: The direct volume rendering technique was found to be successful in the assessment of the arterial supply to the temporomandibular joint. The superficial temporal artery and maxillary artery ran along the lateral and medial sides of the condylar neck, suggesting that these arteries are at increased risk during soft-tissue procedures such as an elective arthroplasty of the temporomandibular joint...|$|E

40|$|The {{external}} {{carotid artery}} normally divides into two terminal branches {{at the level of}} the neck of the mandible. The terminal branches are usually the superficial temporal and maxillary arteries. The maxillary artery is described to be in three parts in relation to the lateral pterygoid muscle as the mandibular (first), pterygoid (second) and the pterygopalatine (third) parts. The second part passes behind the muscle. The branches that arise from the first part of the maxillary artery are the deep auricular, <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic,</b> the middle meningeal, accessory meningeal and inferior alveolar arteries. The middle meningeal artery normally arises at the lower border of lateral pterygoid muscle from the first part of maxillary artery. It then ascends upwards, passes between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve and enters the foramen spinosum in the base of skull. During routine dissection of a male cadaver in the department of anatomy while teaching medical students variations were observed in the termination of the {{external carotid artery}} on the right side. The artery gave three branches at the termination, superficial temporal, maxillary and between the two the middle meningeal artery was seen arising close to the end of the external carotid artery. The middle meningeal artery did not pass between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve. The branches of first part of maxillary artery were variable. The deep auricular branch was absent and its territory may have been supplied by the posterior auricular and anterior auricular <b>arteries.</b> The <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic</b> and accessory meningeal arteries arose from the middle meningeal artery. There were two inferior alveolar arteries 1. 5 cm apart arising from the first part of maxillary artery. The first artery went to the mandibular canal along with the inferior alveolar nerve. The second artery accompanied the lingual nerve to the last molar tooth. Probably this artery may have been an additional supply to the gingiva around the last molar tooth. The other variations that were noted were the absence of mylohyoid branch from the inferior alveolar artery. To the best of our knowledge these variations in the arteries have not been previously reported. ...|$|R
40|$|Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} is a rarely occurring {{symptom of}} vascular origin. Most frequently, {{the symptoms are}} due to an arteriovenous malformation, to a tumor of the jugular glomus or to a local arterial stenosis. A 39 -yr-old Korean male suffering from pulsatile tinnitus of the left ear was diagnosed to have dural arteriovenous malformation of the jugular bulb. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed a high-velocity vascular lesion encroaching the internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinuses. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a dural arteriovenous malformation involving the jugular bulb. The arterial supply was from the neuromeningeal branch of the left ascending pharyngeal <b>artery</b> and inferior <b>tympanic</b> <b>artery.</b> Stenosis of the left jugular vein caused retrograde venous drainage through the contralateral transverse sinus.

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Protoavis is controversial, with several palaeornithologists considering {{it to be}} an early ancestor of modern birds, while most other in the palaeontological community regard it as a chimaera, a mixture of several specimens. American palaeontologist Gregory Paul suggested that Protoavis is a herrerasaur. In a paper by Phil Currie and X.J. Zhao discussing a braincase of a Troodon formosus, they compare the bird-like characters of Troodon and Protoavis. In the paper, they make a number of corrections involving both Chatterjee's and Currie's own misinterpretations of parts of Troodon cranial anatomy before the particular braincase being describing was found. At least a couple of the corrections (the <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic</b> recess, and the relatively kinetic quadrate-squamosal contact) make Troodon more bird-like then Chatterjee made out in his Protoavis paper, but overall these particular corrections seem to have little bearing on the avian features of Protoavis. Currie and Zhao do not explicitly state whether or not they consider Protoavis to be a theropod, however they suggest that although Protoavis has characters suggesting avian affinities, most of these are also found in theropod dinosaurs.|$|R

5000|$|Facing {{the outer}} ear, the lateral wall (or {{membranous}} wall), is formed mainly by the tympanic membrane, partly by {{the ring of}} bone into which this membrane is inserted. This ring of bone is incomplete at its upper part, forming a notch (notch of Rivinus), close to which are three small apertures: the [...] "iter chordæ posterius", the petrotympanic fissure, and the [...] "iter chordæ anterius". The iter chordæ posterius (apertura tympanica canaliculi chordæ) is situated in the angle of junction between the mastoid and membranous wall of tympanic cavity immediately behind the tympanic membrane and on a level with {{the upper end of}} the manubrium of the malleus; it leads into a minute canal, which descends in front of the canal for the facial nerve, and ends in that canal near the stylo-mastoid foramen. Through it the chorda tympani nerve enters the tympanic cavity. The petrotympanic fissure opens just above and in front of the ring of bone into which the tympanic membrane is inserted; in this situation it is a mere slit about 2 mm. in length. It lodges the anterior process and anterior ligament of the malleus, and gives passage to the <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic</b> branch of the internal maxillary artery.

40|$|Penguins have {{undergone}} dramatic changes {{associated with the}} evolution of underwater flight and subsequent loss of aerial flight, which are manifest and well documented in the musculoskeletal system and integument. Significant modification of neurosensory systems and endocranial spaces may also be expected along this locomotor transition. However, no investigations {{of the brain and}} sensory organs of extinct stem lineage Sphenisciformes have been carried out, and few data exist even for extant species of Spheniscidae. In order to explore neuroanatomical evolution in penguins, we generated virtual endocasts for the early Miocene stem penguin Paraptenodytes antarcticus, three extant penguin species (Pygoscelis antarctica, Aptenodytes patagonicus, Spheniscus magellanicus), and two outgroup species (the common loon Gavia immer and the Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis). These endocasts yield new anatomical data and phylogenetically informative characters from the brain, carotid arteries, pneumatic recesses, and semicircular canal system. Despite having undergone over 60 million years of evolution since the loss of flight, penguins retain many attributes traditionally linked to flight. Features associated with visual acuity and proprioception, such as the sagittal eminence and flocculus, show a similar degree of development to those of volant birds in the three extant penguins and Paraptenodytes antarcticus. These features, although clearly not flight-related in penguins, are consistent with the neurological demands associated with rapid manoeuvring in complex aquatic environments. Semicircular canal orientation in penguins is similar to volant birds. Interestingly, canal radius is grossly enlarged in the fossil taxon Pa. antarcticus compared to living penguins and outgroups. In contrast to all other living birds, the contralateral <b>anterior</b> <b>tympanic</b> recesses of extant penguins do not communicate. An interaural pathway connecting these recesses is retained in Pa. antarcticus, suggesting that stem penguins may still have employed this connection, potentially to enhance directional localization of sound. Paedomorphosis, already identified as a potential factor in crown clade penguin skeletal morphology, may also be implicated in the failure of an interaural pathway to form during ontogeny in extant penguins...|$|R
5000|$|Tawa was {{estimated}} to have been 2 m (6.5 ft) long, almost 75 cm at the hips. Other estimates suggest that Tawa weighed 30 kg at most. The holotype, a juvenile individual, cataloged GR 241, consists of a mostly complete but disarticulated skull, forelimbs, the pectoral girdle, a partial vertebral column, hindlimbs, the pelvic girdle, ribs, and gastralia. The determination was made that this specimen is a juvenile based {{on the presence of}} an open braincase and unfused neurocentral sutures. An isolated femur, GR 244, suggests that adults were at least 30% larger than the juvenile holotype. Tawa preserves characters that can be associated with different dinosaur taxa. Its skull morphology resembles that of coelophysoids and the illium approximates that of a herrerasaurid. Like the coelophysoids, Tawa has a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. With respect to limb proportion, the femur is very long compared to the tibia. A neck vertebrae adaptation in Tawa supports the hypothesis that cervical air sacs predate the origin of the taxon Neotheropoda and may be ancestral for Saurischians, and also links the dinosaurs with the evolution of birds. Compared to earlier dinosaurs like Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor, Tawa had a relatively slender build.A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Nesbitt et al.
