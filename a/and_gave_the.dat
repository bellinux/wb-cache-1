5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

When Hồ died on 2 September 1969, the collective leadership he had espoused continued, but Lê Duẩn was first among equals. The Central Committee's first resolution following Hồ's death pledged to uphold the collective leadership. Lê Duẩn chaired Hồ's funeral committee <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> event's final speech.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these attacks}} and {{those from the}} extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Community idea positive support.|$|E

5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} transferred {{control of}} the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical working conditions of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and the hiring, training, and discipline of the police officers.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, {{topographical}} officer George W. Hughes {{reported to}} Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights in the zone, allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many {{claims of}} the {{synthesis}} of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States.
