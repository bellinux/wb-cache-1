40|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{we discovered}} a growth inhibitory factor (GIF) that was abundant in normal human brain, but greatly reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.

40|$|Previously, the GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF 1) /ANGUSTIFOLIA 3 (AN 3) {{transcription}} coactivator gene, {{a member}} of a small gene family comprising three genes, was characterized as a positive regulator of cell proliferation in lateral organs, such as leaves and flowers, of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). As yet, it remains unclear how GIF 1 /AN 3 affects the cell proliferation process. In this study, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> gene family, GIF 2 and GIF 3, are also required for cell proliferation and lateral organ growth, as gif 1, gif 2, and gif 3 mutations cause a synergistic reduction in cell numbers, leading to small lateral organs. Furthermore, GIF 1, GIF 2, and GIF 3 overexpression complemented a cell proliferation defect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gif</b> 1 mutant and significantly increased lateral organ growth of wild-type plants as well, indicating that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> gene family are functionally redundant. Kinematic analysis on leaf growth revealed that <b>the</b> <b>gif</b> triple mutant as well as other strong gif mutants developed leaf primordia with fewer cells, which was due to <b>the</b> low rate <b>of</b> cell proliferation, eventually resulting in earlier exit from <b>the</b> proliferative phase <b>of</b> organ growth. <b>The</b> low proliferative activity of primordial leaves was accompanied by decreased expression of cell cycle-regulating genes, indicating that GIF genes may act upstream of cell cycle regulators. Analysis of gif double and triple mutants clarified a previously undescribed role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> gene family: gif mutants had small vegetative shoot apical meristems, which was correlated with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> small leaf primordia. gif triple mutants also displayed defective structures of floral organs. Taken together, our results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> gene family plays important roles in <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> cell proliferation via cell cycle regulation and in other developmental properties that are associated with shoot apical meristem function...|$|R

When <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> was increased from 1 to 2 g and rotated 60 degrees rightward relative to the head and body, subjects on average set an acoustic stimulus 7. 3 degrees right of their head's median plane to hear it as straight ahead.

This approach essentially involves <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> a cap on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with annual energy sales and, in its simplest version, requires no tradeable certificates or permits. The proposed approach creates a clear measurable link between how compliance is enforced (the retailers' targets) and <b>the</b> desired outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme (measurable reductions in GHG emissions). This drives physical <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme, including negation of any rebound effect within the covered sectors. It also avoids the need to define the activities eligible to create certificates, and likewise, no deeming, auditing, monitoring or verification would be required by government beyond ensuring retailer compliance [...] significantly reducing administration costs. There {{does not appear to be}} a clear precedent for this type of scheme anywhere in the world, and so this paper should be seen as a preliminary scoping of options that are deserving of more in-depth assessment.

40|$|The World Wide Web abounds with {{animated}} {{cartoons and}} advertisements competing for our attention. Most of {{these figures are}} animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files. These files contain a series of ordinary GIF images plus control information, and they provide an exceptionally simple, effective way to animate on the Internet. To date, however, this format has rarely been used for technical data, {{although there is no}} inherent reason not to do so. This paper describes a procedure for creating high-resolution animated GIFs of mode shapes and other types of structural dynamics data with readily available software. The paper shows three example applications using recent modal test data and video footage of a high-speed sled run. A fairly detailed summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> file format is provided in <b>the</b> appendix.

40|$|Transcoding is a {{powerful}} technique employed by network proxies to dynamically customize multimedia objects for prevailing network conditions and individual client characteristics. Transcoding can be performed along {{a number of different}} axes and the specific transcoding technique used depends on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> multimedia object. Our research goal is to understand <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> typical internet images and their transcoding characteristics. We focus our attention on transcodings that customize an image for file size savings. In this paper, we analyze <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> images available on the web. We show that most GIF images accessed on the Internet in a representative trace are small; about 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> images are smaller than 6 KBs. On average, JPEG images are larger than GIF images; about 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JPEG images are larger than 6 KBs. We also establish <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> popular image transcoding operations. We show that for JPEG images, the JPEG compression metric and a tra [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Beginning with <b>the</b> {{third year}} <b>of</b> funding, we began a more ambitious {{archiving}} production effort, minimizing work on new software and concentrating on building representative archives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missions mentioned above, recognizing {{that only a}} small percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data from any one mission can be archived with reasonable effort. We concentrated on data from Dynamics Explorer and ISEE 1, archiving orbits or significant fractions of orbits which attempt to capture <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission and provide data which will hopefully be sufficient for ongoing and new research as well as to provide a reference to upcoming and current ISTP missions which will not fly in <b>the</b> same regions <b>of</b> space as <b>the</b> older missions and which will not have continuous wideband data. We archived approximately 181 Gigabytes of data, accounting for some 1582 hours of data. Included in these data are all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AMPTE chemical releases, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spacelab 2 /PDP data obtained during <b>the</b> free-flight portion <b>of</b> its mission, as well as significant portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S 3, DE- 1, Imp- 6, Hawkeye, Injun 5, and ISEE 1 and 2 data sets. Table 1 summarizes these data. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data archived are summarized in gif-formatted images of frequency-time spectrograms which are directly accessible via <b>the</b> internet. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gif</b> files are identified by year, day, and time as described in the Web page. This provides a user with a specific date/time in mind a way of determining very quickly if there is data for the interval in question and, by clicking on the file name, browsing the data. Alternately, a user can browse the data for interesting features and events simply by viewing each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gif</b> files. When a user finds data of interest, he/she can notify us by email <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time period involved. Based on the user's needs, we can provide data on a convenient medium or by ftp, or we can mount the appropriate data and provide access to our analysis tools via the network. We can even produce products such as plots or spectrograms in hardcopy form based on <b>the</b> specific request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} {{are seeking to}} strengthen global economic competitiveness by building a 'knowledge economy' capability. A popular approach is supporting university-industry knowledge exchange linkages. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} show how a model developed by the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI) for the UK offers a more effective approach to knowledge sharing, and to present the results from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first projects launched by CMI. CMI looked at the background literature and relevant government policy, benchmarked peer grant-making organisations, studied <b>the</b> Massachusetts Institute <b>of</b> Technology and Cambridge University institutions, and organized expert consultation through a strategic planning process including 27 stakeholder groups. Based on these inputs, CMI formulated its Knowledge Integration Community (KIC) model hypothesis. This paper describes the functional components, support mechanisms, organisational structure, review processes and mechanisms for knowledge exchange. Beginning in 2003, CMI built seven experimental KICs: five completely new, and two built up from existing, more traditional research projects. One <b>of</b> these is <b>the</b> Silent Aircraft KIC, which is presented as a case study. The paper makes an early analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcomes and <b>additionalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KIC, and presents the lessons and future implications for the KIC. The paper concludes by describing <b>the</b> broader relevance <b>of</b> this approach for other institutions and countries, and suggests it is something other university-, government- and industry-based research institutions could embark upon. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There {{are many}} image fusion methods {{that can be}} used to produce {{high-resolution}} mutlispectral images from a high-resolution panchromatic image and low-resolution mut-lispectral images. Starting from <b>the</b> physical principle <b>of</b> image formation, this paper presents a comprehensive framework, the general image fusion (GIF) method, which makes it possible to categorize, compare, and evaluate the existing image fusion methods. Using <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> method, it is shown that <b>the</b> pixel values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-resolution mutlispectral images are determined by the corresponding pixel values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-resolution panchromatic image, <b>the</b> approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-resolution panchromatic image at the low-resolution level. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing image fusion methods, including, but not limited to, intensity–hue–satu-ration, Brovey transform, principal component analysis, high-pass filtering, high-pass modulation, the à trous algorithm-based wavelet transform, and multiresolution analysis-based intensity modulation (MRAIM), are evaluated and found to be particular cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GIF</b> method. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> each image fusion method is theoretically analyzed based on how the corresponding low-resolution panchromatic image is computed and how the modulation coefficients are set. An experiment based on IKONOS images shows that there is consistency between the theoretical analysis and the experimental results and that the MRAIM method synthesizes the images closest to those the corresponding multisensors would observe at the high-resolution level.
