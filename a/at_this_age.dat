5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E
5|$|Cameron began acting at age nine, and {{his first}} job was in an {{advertisement}} for a breakfast cereal. His first starring role was at age 13, in the television series Two Marriages. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> he appeared in several television shows and films. He became famous in 1985 after being cast as Mike Seaver in the ABC television sitcom Growing Pains. In the series, Mike would eventually have a girlfriend named Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Cameron's future wife. Cameron subsequently became a teen heartthrob in the late 1980s, while appearing {{on the covers of}} several teen magazines, including Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, 16 and others. At the time, he was making $50,000 a week. He was also in a 60-second Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, {{canthaxanthin}} and adonirubin, {{are responsible}} for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age.</b> The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.|$|E

25|$|By 36–60 months, phonological {{awareness}} continues to improve {{as well as}} pronunciation. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> children have a considerable experience with language {{and are able to}} form simple sentences that are 3 words in length. They use basic prepositions, pronouns, and plurals. They become immensely creative in their language use and learn to categorize items such as recognizing that a shoe is not a fruit. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> children also learn to ask questions and negate sentences to develop these questions. Over time, their syntax gets more and more unique and complex.|$|E
25|$|Children’s {{comprehension}} vocabulary size {{ranges from}} about 92 to 321 words. The production vocabulary size <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> is typically around 50 words. This shows that comprehension vocabulary grows faster than production vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|Children’s {{production}} vocabulary size <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> {{is typically}} around 50 words, {{although there is}} great variation in vocabulary size among children in the same age group, with a range between 0 and 160 words {{for the majority of}} children.|$|E

25|$|Stage III: Around 36–42 months, {{children}} {{continue to}} add morphemes and gradually produce complex grammatical structures. The morphemes that are added <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> include irregular past tense, possessive ('s), {{and use of}} the verb 'to be' (It is, I am, etc.).|$|E

25|$|As {{for word}} {{comprehension}}, Fenson et al. (1994) tested 10-11-month-old children’s comprehension vocabulary size {{and found a}} range from 11 words to 154 words. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>age,</b> children normally have not yet begun to speak and thus have no production vocabulary. So clearly, comprehension vocabulary develops before production vocabulary.|$|E

He excelled in Indian designs and arts, and painted an oil copy of Entombment by Titian.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{effects of}} {{solitude}} may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively. This is largely because, often, solitude <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> {{is not something}} chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they are unsure of how to interact socially with others so they prefer to be alone, causing shyness or social rejection.|$|E

Eye tests should be performed yearly as eye problems can develop over time. By two years of age, Shiba Inus can be considered fully free from joint problems if none have been discovered by this point, since <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> the skeleton is fully developed.|$|E

25|$|Infants usually {{produce their}} first word around 12 –14 months of age. First words are simple in {{structure}} and contain the same sounds {{that were used}} in late babbling. The lexical items they produce are probably stored as whole words rather than as individual segments that get put together online when uttering them. This is suggested by the fact that infants <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> may produce the same sounds differently in different words.|$|E
25|$|Children {{are able}} to {{distinguish}} newly learned ‘words’ associated with objects {{if they are not}} similar-sounding, such as ‘lif’ and ‘neem’. They cannot distinguish similar-sounding newly learned words such as ‘bih’ and ‘dih’, however. So, while children <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age</b> {{are able to}} distinguish monosyllabic minimal pairs at a purely phonological level, if the discrimination task is paired with word meaning, the additional cognitive load required by learning the word meanings leaves them unable to spend the extra effort on distinguishing the similar phonology.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidelines}} {{also say}} women aged between 40 and 42 {{should be offered}} one cycle of IVF on the NHS {{if all of the}} following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>age.</b> However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.|$|E
