Method: The study is based on a quantitative research method, where the analysis of annual reports takes place. The quantitative research method has enabled the paper to perform related analyzes and comparisons of means between groups, for listed companies equity ratio and pension obligation, and the relation to its <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Correlation measurements are made using a non-parametric method, Spearman's rho, then further tested using one-sided hypotheses t-test. Theory: The backbone of the thesis is presented using two theories, earnings management and the principal-agent theory.

The data used in this study comes from seven surveys of state and local pension systems conducted by the Government Finance Officers Association and the Public Pension Coordinating Council from 1990 through 2000. This survey typically includes 250 to 300 pension systems and over 350 pension plans per year. With respect to investment decisions, the findings indicate that politically-affiliated trustees are associated with more conservative investment strategies, which is consistent with attempting to minimize potentially harmful outcomes in the political arena. Member-elected trustees are associated with {{a more active role in}} protecting shareholder rights and challenging the management of the companies in which they are shareholders. With respect to investment performance, the results show that the board of trustees has little impact on the system 2 ̆ 7 s financial performance beyond its choice of investment strategies or management practices. With respect to the setting of <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions,</b> the results indicate that during times of fiscal stress, politically-affiliated trustees will manipulate a public pension system 2 ̆ 7 s <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> to achieve other political goals.

40|$|Generalized Linear Model Approach to Adjusting Expected Assumptions of Long-Term Care Incidence Rates Rozita Ramli, PhD University of Connecticut, 2016 <b>Actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> {{are needed}} in most of actuarial works, for example pricing and reserving and setting capital standards. In {{long-term}} care (LTC) insurance, three main <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> are incidence, termination and utilization rates. These assumptions {{can be seen as}} factors affecting the financial progress in LTC insurance business. Insurance companies must make sure the assumptions they use adequately reflect actual experience to avoid adverse financial consequences. Hence, a regular systematic methodology to monitor expected assumptions is essential. This work proposes a methodology to adjusting expected assumptions of LTC incidence rates. The methodology uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach in modeling incidence rates and the adjustment is parallel to an established industry technique of stochastic deferred acquisition cost (DAC) unlocking. The methodology uses confidence intervals as a decision tool to decide if any adjustment is needed. We also bring in a credibility component into the methodology to provide rationalization for choosing the appropriate significant level of the confidence interval when applying the methodology. Lastly we study the effect of size of historical experience used in the adjustment on the efficiency of the methodology. Similar to how the stochastic DAC unlocking technique is an acceptable technique by regulators and practitioners, we foresee our GLM methodology to be accepted as a basis for adjusting assumptions under Principle-Based Reserving in the future...|$|R

The increasing risks behind the pension liabilities have highlighted {{the need for more}} informative and accurate pension disclosures. Investors need more information on pensions {{in order to understand the}} underlying risks and adjust their investment decisions accordingly. A sample of 20 of the listed FTSE 100 companies, between 2005 and 2006, was taken to explore the quality of pension disclosures. This study makes original and unique contribution by comparing the sample disclosure scores with the benchmark, Generico, to enable the quality of disclosures to be explored. The study found that there is a general improvement in both the overall levels of pension disclosures and principal <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> disclosures, but the quality of the disclosures is still poor in comparison with Generico. This result raises questions regarding pension deficits volatility and suggests that changes in life expectancy, volatility of inflation rates, discount rates and the equity markets are still the key factors for the pension risks. Adoption of IFRS improves the quality of pension disclosures in general. This study also looks for positive correlations between the amount of text units of pension information and disclosure scores.

40|$|On 30 November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard 17 (‘Retirement Benefits’, FRS 17) to {{supersede}} Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (‘Accounting for Pension Costs’, SSAP 24). It removed managerial discretion over the main <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> {{used to estimate}} employers’ pension obligations, and required the recognition of pension assets and liabilities on a consistent ‘fair value’ basis. However, FRS 17 was only fully effective for reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2005. This thesis examines empirically how the prolonged period associated with the debate, promotion and implementation of FRS 17 interacted with various managerial pension choices. Evidence of these interactions can help discriminate among competing theoretical perspectives concerning employers’ long-term defined benefit pension obligations. This thesis draws upon these competing theoretical frameworks to develop and test hypotheses concerning the impact of pension accounting regulatory change on UK firms’ discretion over pension <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions,</b> termination and asset allocation during the period 1998 – 2002. The empirical results support three major hypotheses. Firstly, the magnitude of expected {{rate of return on}} pension assets assumption used for financial reporting purposes is driven primarily by the UK firms’ balance sheet leverage. Secondly, firms’ defined pension benefits termination decision is inter-related with their pension financial reporting choices. Thirdly, the allocation of pension assets has been managed in a way to reduce firms’ cash contribution risks that stem from measuring both pension assets and liabilities on a ‘fair value’ basis. These findings imply managerial discretionary behaviour related to these choices is consistent with the perspective that employer firms and their sponsored pension funds are an integrated economic entity, as is asserted by the new UK pension accounting rule (FRS 17) ...|$|R

The actual contribution chosen by the actuary is found to depend on the contribution level that triggers a red flag with respect to tax deductibility. If this level is relatively low, the actuary chooses a high contribution that gives weight to each criterion, incorporating the risk of a penalty by tax authorities.
