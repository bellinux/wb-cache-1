5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{to the garden}} of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him {{up the stairs and}} out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, France, {{after having}} won the coin toss for {{the choice of}} uniforms, famously wore the blue/white/red of the French flag <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to within a metre of the haka performance, forming a line of {{opposition}} to the performance by the All Blacks, who were wearing a predominantly silver uniform (as opposed to the traditional all black). France went on to beat the All Blacks 20–18.|$|E

25|$|The ninth match, and {{the main}} match in the undercard, was between Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell) and Goldberg with DeWayne Bruce in a No Disqualification tag-team match, where if Goldberg lost {{he would have had}} to retire. The match started out with Goldberg against Bagwell, where Goldberg had full control of the match. Bruce was then tagged in by Goldberg where he gained an early {{advantage}} over Bagwell for a short time, but was then double teamed by Totally Buffed. Goldberg was then tagged in, where Bagwell gained the upper-hand. Luger then exited the ring <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to a fan, who asked for Goldberg's autograph earlier in the event. This distracted and lured Goldberg near the fan, who sprayed mace into Goldberg's eyes. Luger then lifted Goldberg on his shoulders and Bagwell hit a Super Blockbuster. Luger covered him for the victory, thus ending Goldberg's undefeated streak of thirty-five victories and forcing Goldberg to retire from professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E
500|$|Walden {{demanded that}} whoever was {{responsible}} be terminated; as a result, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, and Tuffy Phillips all were fired. [...] "That was a culmination of everything falling apart.... They were {{a symptom of}} the problem—not the problem itself," [...] said Perkins. The band again joined the Grateful Dead and the Band in July at Watkins Glen Speedway in New York's Finger Lakes region, for what was then deemed the largest rock concert ever. 150,000 tickets were sold, but the crowd expanded to nearly 600,000, causing it to be declared a disaster area. People abandoned their cars <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to ten miles to attend the concert. The jam between the three bands was later called [...] "garbage" [...] by Trucks, as all involved were under the influence of various substances, including alcohol, cocaine, and LSD. To promote the release of the album, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert program staged an episode set in Macon, taping performances from the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. Betts walked offstage midway through the performance, with Walden chasing him down the street and urging him to return. [...] "Walking off the stage was a first for me. It was like, 'Dude, what are you doing? We're all brothers here. If there's a problem, let's talk about it,'" [...] said Leavell.|$|E

He left his friend's minivan <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, {{as if he had been}} running. He told his friend Trevor Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, [...] "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it".|$|E
2500|$|At {{around midnight}} on November 7, 1881, Miller was {{drinking}} at Dick Darling's Broadway saloon {{with several of}} his friends including Bill Bowie, George Law Jr., Harry Rice, Charles Crawford and Billy Temple. After an hour, Tracy was seen peeking into the saloon from the front entrance. A few minutes later, he reentered the saloon <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to the bar to order a whiskey sour. He then turned to Miller and said [...] "I came in here to kill you" [...] before drawing a revolver and pointing it at his head before shooting him in the stomach. Miller reached for his pistol but collapsed onto the floor. Miller was taken by ambulance to the New York Hospital where he died from his wounds shortly after his arrival. Tracy was arrested and tried for his murder, however he {{was found not guilty}} due to perjured testimony and returned to running his saloon.|$|E
