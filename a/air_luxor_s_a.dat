50|$|Hi Fly's first {{aircraft}} was an Airbus A330-300 which {{had previously been}} operated by <b>Air</b> <b>Luxor</b> (which was owned by the same family that now owns Hi Fly before being sold and shut down). The {{aircraft was}} recently on contract to the Air Component of the Belgian Armed Forces {{until the end of}} 2013. Two A310-300s were then added in 2008 and these were leased to Oman Air flying the carrier's first long-haul routes (to London/Heathrow and Bangkok). New aircraft were then delivered from Airbus in 2008 and 2009: an A330-200 and two A340-500s, the latter used for approximately 5 years on behalf of Arik Air in Nigeria on its route between Lagos and New York/John F. Kennedy, painted in its colors, until Hi Fly repossessed the airframes in spring 2015. Since then, more A330s and A340s have also been obtained, including four in 2013. In February 2014, Hi Fly added its first narrow-body aircraft, an A321-200 that has been leased to the Belgian Army in replacement of the former A330-300.|$|R

As part of this, the Antiguan government invested 2 million US dollars in boosting the number of hotel rooms available, from 3,000 to 5,000, and opened the Antigua Hotel Institute, seeking to train Antiguans in how to more efficiently and effectively work in the tourism industry. Joseph also oversaw the government buying {{a third of the}} Jolly Beach Resort in an attempt to save it from bankruptcy, establishing a management company to oversee the property. In February 2000 he led the government delegation in an official visit to Beijing, where they met with Jiang Zhenghua, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to discuss [...] "bilateral relations and the issues of common concern". He also led the Antiguan delegation to the World Travel Market in 2001.

The procedure was varied by the use of different water temperatures, by diving with snorkel breathing, by apnoea without diving, and by apnoea with a stream of air against the face instead of immersion in water. Diving for 12 <b>s</b> elicited <b>a</b> pronounced activation of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.,</b> the mean increase from control periods being 360 %. The response was stronger with lower water temperatures. Immersion of the whole face evoked a stronger increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> than immersion of mouth and nose only. Diving without apnoea elicited a significant but weaker increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.,</b> whereas apnoea only for 12 s did not influence the sympathetic outflow. Cool air against the face during apnoea for 12 s was associated with a significant increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> The increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> usually occurred before the bradycardia. On emersion, m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> ceased abruptly, whereas the bradycardia persisted for a few seconds. Mental arithmetic during diving did not change the m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> response but reduced the bradycardia. M. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> increased despite increasing blood pressure levels. On emersion, m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> did not reappear until the pre-diving blood pressure level was attained. <b>S.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>a</b> was inhibited on diving, with concomitant vasodilatation in the skin as recorded in the big toe. It is concluded that the response of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> to diving is initiated by a central 'pattern recognition' of an input from facial receptors, that this input and the effects of apnoea, acting by mutual reinforcement, maintain the strong sympathetic outflow, and that the mechanism releasing m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> on diving overrides the normal blood pressure regulatory function of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> Diving exerts differentiated influence on different parts of the sympathetic nervous system, as illustrated by the inhibition of <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>a...</b>|$|R
