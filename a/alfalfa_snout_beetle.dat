40|$|Historically (early 1900 s) grape rootworm (GRW) was {{the major}} insect pest of grapes growing in New York and {{surrounding}} states (Johnson and Hammar 1910). Grape rootworm adults do some minor leaf feeding in early to mid-summer. However, larval feeding on grape roots can reduce vine vigor or even cause vine death at high densities. For various reasons, including the seasonal use of broad-spectrum synthetic insecticides, the pest status of GRW declined {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. However, with the advent of more selective insecticides and the overall reduction in the number of applications during the season, reports of GRW adult feeding damage have greatly increased in recent years, especially in the Lake Erie Grape Belt. This was the first year of a multi-year project examining the need for managing grape rootworm populations, the optimal timing of insecticides for control of grape rootworm and the use of entomopathogenic nematodes (a biological control used successfully for <b>alfalfa</b> <b>snout</b> <b>beetle)</b> against grape rootworm larva.

40|$|The {{vertical}} movement, persistence, {{and activity}} of four isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Oswego), Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (NC), Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (NY 001),and an undescribed Steinernema species (NY 008 - 2 E), were evaluated for 24 mo at field locations in northern New York. Nematodes were released into three alfalfa fields naturally infested with <b>alfalfa</b> <b>snout</b> <b>beetle,</b> Otiorhynchus ligustici (L.). Each field differed in soil type and soil textural composition: silt loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand. Nematodes were recovered from soil using trap insects, Galleria mellonella larvae, and their vertical distribution was monitored at 5 -cm intervals to depths of 20 cm for Steinernena species and 35 cm for Heterorhabditis species. All nematodes persisted (no {{significant reduction in}} percentage of infection of G. mellonella) for 6 mo after the initial application in all soil types. However, {{by the end of}} the second growing season (17 mo after application), all nematodes showed significant reductions in infection rates of G. mellonella except H. bacteriophora (Oswego) which showed high levels of infection for 24 mo. Nematode vertical movement was affected by soil type and varied by isolate. S. carpocapsae (NY 00 l) and Steinernema sp. (NY 008 - 2 E) remained primarily in soil depths < 15 cm, whereas both heterorhabditids dispersed to soil depths of 35 cm. Vertical movement of H. bacteriophera (Oswego) was greatest in loamy sand and vertical movement of Steinernema sp. (NY 008 - 2 E) was greatest in sandy loam. Percentage of infection of G. mellonella by H. bacteriophora (Oswego) and S. carpocapsae (NY 00 l) was significantly correlated with rising soil temperatures in early spring.

40|$|In South Africa the genus, Eucalyptus {{plays an}} {{important}} role as a major economic component in the forest and mining sector. Unfortunately, this genus has problems due to damage by pests. The Eucalyptus <b>snout</b> <b>beetle,</b> Gonipterus scutellatus, feeds and defoliates the leaves of eucalypts. Plants produce secondary metabolites, which protects them against defoliation by insects and herbivores. This study focuses on the variations of total soluble phenolic content of nine Eucalyptus species between the species and within the species throughout the year. Total soluble phenols were quantified with the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. There was a general increase in the concentration of total soluble phenols throughout the year. The content of total soluble phenols were generally higher compared to carbohydrates. This experiment needs to be done on a continuous basis so as to formulate a screening method for eucalypt species that are resistant to G. scutellatus.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} semiochemical identification expertise and methodology at the University of Pretoria. The Eucalyptus <b>snout</b> <b>beetle</b> Gonipterus scutellatus {{was used as a}} model insect in developing these methods, firstly because it is a known pest in the Eucalyptus forestry industry of South Africa. Secondly, nothing is known about its chemical ecology and lastly, it is a relatively large insect that is easily worked on. Three main techniques were used namely: Electroantennography (EAG), Gas Chromatography Electroantennography Detection (GC-EAD) and Gas Chromatog- raphy Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). EAG was used to difierentiate and identify certain Eucalyptus species that were expected to contain compounds that may function as either kairomones or allomones for G. scutellatus. The EAG process revealed that G. scutellatus responds more intensely to damaged Eucalyptus leaves as compared to undamaged leaves. The crushed foliage of the known hosts Eucalyptus globulus and E. viminalis gave larger responses than the crushed foliage from a known non-host E. citriodora. We sampled the volatiles from the crushed foliage of these three species and tentatively identified sixteen compounds from the E. globulus volatile profile that was antennally active for G. scutellatus females. The presence of these volatiles were subsequently investigated for E. viminalis and E. citriodora. The green leaf volatiles, (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and (E) - 2 -hexenal and aromatic compounds, 2 -phenylethanol, benzyl acetate and ethylphenylacetate often gave larger responses than the terpenes such as α-pinene, β-pinene and camphene. Crushed E. globulus leaves contained 2 -phenyl ethanol, benzyl acetate, ethylphenylacetate, eucalyptol, α-pinene, (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and (E) - 2 -hexenal that were antennally active. The E. viminalis profile had very little 2 -phenylethanol and virtually no benzyl acetate. The E. citriodora volatile profile contained very little (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, (E) - 2 -hexenal, 2 -phenylethanol, benzyl acetate and ethylphenylacetate. These compounds may influence the host selection behaviour of G. scutellatusfemales. These volatiles can be tested in a behavioural bioassay in order to determine their effect on the Eucalyptus <b>snout</b> <b>beetle</b> G. scutellatus.

Fossil fish from Driftwood Canyon in the Canadian Museum of Nature include specimens collected in the 1930s; however, the Driftwood Canyon (also known as Driftwood Creek beds) fossils have only been studied since the 1950s. The Driftwood Canyon fossil beds are best known for the abundant and well-preserved insect and fish fossils (Amia, Amyzon, and Eosalmo).

40|$|Export of Pink Lady™ apples from Australia {{have been}} {{significantly}} affected by infestations of adult eucalyptus weevil (eucalyptus <b>snout</b> <b>beetle</b> or gum tree weevil). These weevils do not damage apple trees or fruit, but rest at the petiole portion of apples when selecting overwintering sites. As a result apples infested with live eucalyptus weevils leads to rejection for export. Usage of methyl bromide as post harvest treatment is restricted under the Montreal Protocol. Therefore, {{it has become}} important to develop an alternative safe fumigant as an eradication method for eucalyptus weevil on apple. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate ethyl formate, which is a naturally occurring volatile chemical present in many plant commodities, as fumigant for eradication of the eucalyptus weevil on apples. Laboratory and cool storage trials show that ethyl formate is highly toxic to the eucalyptus weevil and low phytotoxic to the fruit. Complete control can be achieved at 30 g m- 3 of ethyl formate at 25 ºC for 24 hours exposure with and without apple. In comparison with untreated apples, the colour and texture have no change 1, 2 and 3 weeks after treatment. Four field trials were conducted in cool storages (the capacity ranged from 250 - 900 tonnes) in Western Australia. The ethyl formate was applied at dosage of 50 - 55 g m- 3 and low temperature (4 - 8 ºC) for 24 hours exposure.

40|$|During {{extensive}} excavations at Forsandmoen in {{the municipality}} of Forsand, Rogaland, SW-Norway, a prehistoric agricultural settlement has been discovered. According to 210 14 C age determinations, the totally 250 houses represent a time span of approximately 2000 years, beginning at 1500 BC. Cereals {{have been raised}} {{in the same area}} during the whole settlement period. This new knowledge is a result of systematic sampling and examination of about 1000 soil samples, equal to 8 m 3 of soil, which has resulted in approximate 20. 000 charred cereal grains and a similar number of other seeds, mainly of agricultural weeds. Grains from three bronze age houses from approximately 1400 and 800 BC represents 70 % of the charred grains, mainly naked barley (Hordeum vulgare nudum), a little emmer (Triticum dicoccum) and spelt (T. spelta). At the Forsandmoen site some problems should be weighted especially. The soil is very poor in nutritients, and an acceptable crop is totally dependent of regularly manuring. Alternatively the soil has to lie fallow in periods. Soil treatment either with hand tools or ard has been especially laborious due to a soil consisting of gravel and stones. High mountains and long slopes around the plain increase the risk of frost greatly during the vegetation season. Unripe grains, some grains with traces of <b>snout</b> <b>beetles</b> and sclerotias of the poisonous ergot (Claviceps purpurea) are other signs of difficulties in the cereal raising. Even if pollen analysis indicate cereal growing in the actual area, some of the grain may have been a result of trade.

40|$|Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) Blake (Myrtaceae) was {{imported}} into Florida from Australia {{over a century}} ago as a landscape plant. A favorable climate and periodic wildfires helped M. quinquenervia thrive; it now occupies about 200, 000 hectares in southern Florida. A biological control (i. e., biocontrol) program against M. quinquenervia has been initiated, but not all biocontrol releases are successful. Some scientists have argued that poor biocontrol agent success may relate to genetic differences among populations of invasive weeds. I tested this premise by determining (1) the number and origins of M. quinquenervia introductions into Florida, (2) whether multiple introduction events resulted in the partitioning of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s M. quinquenervia populations into discrete biotypes, and (3) whether Oxyops vitiosa, an Australia <b>snout</b> <b>beetle</b> imported to control this weed, might discriminate among putative M. quinquenervia biotypes. Careful scrutiny of early horticultural catalogs and USDA plant introduction records suggested at least six distinct introduction events. Allozyme analyses indicated that the pattern of these introductions, and the subsequent redistribution of progeny, has resulted in geographic structuring of the populations in southern Florida. For example, trees on Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Gulf Coast had a greater effective number of alleles and exhibited greater heterozygosity than trees on the Atlantic Coast. Essential oil yields from M. quinquenervia leaves followed a similar trend; Gulf Coast trees yielded nearly twice as much oil as Atlantic Coast trees when both were grown in a common garden. These differences were partially explained by the predominance of a chemical phenotype (chemotype) very rich in the sesquiterpene (E) -nerolidol in M. quinquenervia trees from the Gulf Coast, but rich {{in a mixture of}} the monoterpene 1, 8 -cineole and the sesquiterpene viridiflorol in trees from the Atlantic Coast.
