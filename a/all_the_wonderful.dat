The city is also where one of the miracles that have happened in my life took place: I met Ma Anandamayi, a great spiritual soul. Seeing the beauty of her face and mind, I became her ardent devotee. Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> places I have seen in the world.

500|$|After their {{short-lived}} {{television series}} Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about [...] "that special {{time in your}} life when your friends are your family," [...] basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green was originally named Rachel Robbins. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on [...] "finding <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> roadblocks for them to be with each other." ...|$|E

Following the performance of [...] "Applause", Gaga appeared in a white jumpsuit and green colored wig which she had introduced during the Artpop era. She {{stood in the middle of}} the Ballroom stage and sang the opening lyrics while purple neon lights flooded the stage. On April 2, her performance of the song was broadcast on Late Show with David Letterman along with her song [...] "Dope". Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian recalled that the performance of [...] "G.U.Y." [...] received [...] "as much love as [...] first big hit 'Just Dance'". April Spanos from The Village Voice rendered the performances of [...] "Applause" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] as the [...] "power duo" [...] of the night. She added that the latter was [...] "particularly pleasant to hear live; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was felt all over the dancefloor." [...] Conversely, Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the [...] "extravagant" [...] choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] On the final day of the Roseland shows, Gaga took a bow with her dancers after the performance, saying [...] "Roseland, thank you for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> memories you've given us...

His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a mattress on the floor. One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> candy he made until the other candymakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which led him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee.|$|E

[...] Hitler had promised the Germans great wealth and vast stores of food. [...] Disney and the Army knew this and wanted to depict the Germans living in a land that was hollow of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> promises that Hitler made. [...] Producers of the cartoon also wished {{to show that the}} working conditions of the factories were not as glorious as Hitler was making them sound in his speeches.

2500|$|Norris {{has made}} {{statements}} about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly {{in relation to}} the Papacy. He criticised Pope John Paul II's statements on homosexuality because he said they led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an [...] "instrument for evil as far as I'm concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community". Norris also described the pope's position as [...] "calculated and deliberate wickedness" [...] because he [...] "closes down scholarly enquiry" [...] and because he [...] "marginalised <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad." [...] Commenting on then Cardinal Ratzinger, he said, [...] "Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a Nazi" [...] because he is [...] "afraid to tell the truth," [...] and because he and John Paul II [...] "won't even let themselves be {{in the presence of the}} truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things." [...] He later stated that he regretted using the term [...] "Nazi" [...] in reference to Ratzinger.|$|E
