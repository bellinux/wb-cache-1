5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|With {{his health}} {{improved}} by the tour, Wisden reported that Macaulay was in excellent {{form for the}} whole of the 1923 season. His performances earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation praised his stamina, spin and ability to bowl on all kinds of pitches but noted that he was easily discouraged and had <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> if circumstances went against him. He achieved his highest season total of wickets to date, taking 166 at an average of 13.84, and came third in both the Yorkshire and national bowling averages. His best performance came in the first match of the season, when he took seven wickets for 13 against Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 63. Later in the season, he took a hat-trick against Warwickshire while claiming five for 42. With the bat, Macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18.52. There were no international matches that season, but Macaulay was selected for The Rest in a Test trial against England in which he took just one wicket.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, pupils have {{negative}} expectations {{and experiences of}} learning Swedish which may foster <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark {{back to the time}} when Finland was a part of Sweden (see Sweden–Finland), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few Swedish-speakers in mainland Finland outside the coastal area by the Baltic Sea, and thus contact with Swedish-speakers is rare for most Finns. This fact can for some make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Hindu and Islamic {{studies were}} no longer {{supported}} by the British Crown, and {{nearly all of the}} madrasahs lost their waqf (lit. financial endowment). Discontent by these reforms, Muslim and Hindu rebels initiated the first rebellion in 1857 which was suppressed by the British forces, followed by final abdication of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II, also the same year. Noting the sensitivity of this issue, Queen Victoria removed the East India Company and consolidated the power by gaining the control of subcontinent into British Empire. Directives issues by Queen Victoria led to the quick removal of Mughal symbols which spawned <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> amongst some Muslims towards everything modern and western, and a disinclination {{to make use of the}} opportunities available under the new regime. This tendency, had it continued for long, would have proven disastrous for the Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|In 1835 Lord Macaulay's minute {{recommending that}} Western rather than Oriental {{learning}} predominate in the East India Company's education policy {{had led to}} numerous changes. In place of Arabic and Persian, the Western languages, history and philosophy were taught at state-funded schools and universities whilst religious education was barred. English became not only the medium of instruction but also the official language in 1835 in place of Persian, disadvantaging those who had built their careers around the latter language. Traditional Islamic studies were no longer supported by the state, and some madrasahs lost their waqf or endowment. The Indian rebellion of 1857 is held by nationalists to have ended in disaster for the Muslims, as Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal, was deposed. Power over the subcontinent was passed from the East India Company to the British Crown. The removal of the last symbol of continuity with the Mughal period spawned <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> amongst some Muslims towards everything modern and western, and a disinclination {{to make use of}} the opportunities available under the new regime.|$|E
25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal internalization {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> when they see thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.|$|E
25|$|Both Arcades and A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634 were masques {{commissioned}} by the family of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater through the influence of Lawes, the Earl's music tutor for his children. Arcades was written to honour Alice Spencer, Countess Dowager of Derby, and performed on her estate at Harefield west of London; the date is debated, perhaps in October 1632 as the family tried to put behind it the scandal of the execution of her son-in-law Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven for sexual offences, or on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634. A Mask was performed for Michaelmas eve, 29 September 1634, at Ludlow Castle, the Earl of Bridgewater's residence. This masque differed in some ways from other masques of the time, {{in that it was}} longer and did not rely as much on music. The text was revised and published in 1638. Milton was a theatre-goer in his youth, as he mentions in Elegy I, and his dramatic work on masques, though the genre was closely associated with court entertainments, has been seen as suggestive of a reforming rather than <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> to drama, in contrast to militant critics such as William Prynne from the Puritan side.|$|E

Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to shape up before they override her shielding of him. At the same time, Casey himself is thinking about quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only be doing it for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to. At the end of the episode, a unique sporting event involving the return of a 41-year-old injured athlete to the running track makes Casey change his mind.|$|E
500|$|Historiography of Żydokomuna remains controversial. Works such {{as those}} by Jan T. Gross have {{polarized}} debate over anti-Jewish violence in Poland, with Gross and his supporters characterizing Żydokomuna as an antisemitic cliché while {{to some of his}} critics Żydokomuna was a fact of history. According to Gross's supporters, the strength of the Żydokomuna belief stemmed from age-old Polish fears of Russia and from anti-communist and antisemitic attitudes. Schatz writes that [...] "because antisemitism {{was one of the main}} forces that drew Jews to the Communist movement, Żydokomuna meant turning the effects of antisemitism into a cause of its further increase." [...] Żydokomuna boosted antisemitism by amplifying ideas about an alleged [...] "Jewish world conspiracy." [...] According to this thinking, Bolshevism and communism became [...] "the modern means to the long-attempted Jewish political conquest of Poland; the Żydokomuna conspirators would finally succeed in establishing a 'Judeo-Polonia.'" [...] Subscribers to this theory maintain that there was a strong tradition of antisemitism which provided a base for Żydokomuna to feed upon. These sources claim that many Poles likely exaggerated Jewish participation in the Soviet occupation because a Jewish presence in the government apparatus was a novel phenomenon in pre-war Poland. Critics of these sources, such as Niall Ferguson, claim that much of the anti-Jewish sentiment was justified due to the disproportionate influence of Jewish communists in carrying out Soviet policies. According to Ferguson, [...] "The entire Polish population adopted <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> towards the Jews because of their blatant cooperation with the Bolsheviks and their hostility against non-Jews." ...|$|E
