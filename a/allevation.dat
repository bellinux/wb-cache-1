I bought a cottage {{as close as possible}} to the place where she is buried, and there her daughter (my fellow-sufferer and now my chief comfort) and I, live constantly during a great portion of the year. My objects in life are solely those which were hers; my pursuits and occupations those in which she shared, or sympathized, and which are indissolubly associated with her. Her memory is to me a religion, and her approbation the standard by which, summing up as it does all worthiness, I endeavour to regulate my life.|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of our {{paper is to}} better {{understand}} water management reform in China's communities, especially focusing on the effect {{that it will have}} on the nation's water resources and the rural population. To pursue this goal, the paper has three objectives. First, we track the evolution of water management reform and seek to identify the incentive mechanisms that encourage water managers to more efficiently use water. Second, we identify the impact of water management reform on crop water use, the primary motivation of the policy. Finally, the paper explores how changes in China's water management reform affect agricultural production, farmer income and poverty. Based on a random sample of 57 villages, 231 farmers and 462 plots in four large irrigation districts in Ningxia and Henan provinces, both provinces in China's Yellow River Basin, our results show that two of the main forms of water management reform, Water User Associations and contracting, individual water contractors, have begun to systematically replace traditional forms of collective management. The impacts analysis demonstrates {{that it is not the}} nominal implementation the reform that matters, but rather it is the creation of new management institutions that offer manager strong incentive to save water. Specifically, when managers in reformed organizations face strong incentive, they save water and, importantly, given China's concerns about national food production and poverty <b>allevation,</b> the reductions in water do not lead to reductions in either production, income or higher incidences of poverty...|$|E
40|$|Poverty {{has always}} been a concern in Indonesia. More than half of Indonesia's 235 million people are poor. The {{district}} of Kulon Progo is the second lowest district in Yogyakarta province both in economic growth and welfare level, so less developed among four others district. This research’s aim is to address factors influence the farm development in poverty alleviation and rural development in Kulon Progo Regency of Yogyakarta Special Province of Indonesia. Statistical data were retrieved from Indonesia’s Central Board of Statistic in range of 2003 through 2006. Primary data comprised of farm development by the government, rural poverty in each village, farmer experience in poverty <b>allevation</b> were derived by conducting direct audience with the government officials, head of villages, field farm officials, farmer group units, and field observation. Using purposive random sampling, this research divides Kulon Progo Regency into north zone, middle zone, and south zone; according to the lowest and highest poverty level of each village. Regression model is developed with classical normal linier regression model to reveal each variable share on rural poverty. Simultaneously, this linear regression model explains 70 % of rural poverty caused by all variables. Numbers of farmer positively affects numbers of poor rural inhabitants, where the 1 % increasing of numbers of farmer will raise 0. 922 % numbers of poor rural inhabitants. Irrigated land has a negative impact to rural poverty, where the increasing level of 1 % irrigated land will eradicate 0. 101 % numbers of poor rural inhabitants. Numbers of household member is not significant to influence poor rural inhabitants. In contrary of common belief, the significant role of land ownership has a positive impact to influence rural poverty, where the 1 % increasing size of land ownership will raise 0. 177 % poor rural inhabitants. Regression model results land ownership positively affects rural poverty. Taking interview with some key persons in the six villages compared to statistical data explains that poverty rate is affected by dry land productivity rather than wet land productivity. Based on geographic information system analysis, there are some run-off of water bodies in the north zone. These potential flows should be able to support farm development in the dry land. ...|$|E
