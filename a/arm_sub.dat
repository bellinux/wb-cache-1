50|$|The game {{is divided}} into two parts; one in which the player {{controls}} the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and is able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which the player must achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require the player to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels; others have the player make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where the player must rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and has to use <b>armed</b> <b>subs</b> to clear several cave-ins before they can bring in the only mini-sub that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between the player's mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require the player to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the Four Four Bravo were armed with SLR rifles, except 2nd Lt. Gunawardene who was <b>armed</b> with a <b>sub</b> machine gun and grenades. The LTTE used sub machine guns, {{repeater}} shot guns stolen from the Chavakachcheri Police Station. They had with them T56 assault rifle and a SLR rifle.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, in {{association}} with OSEL of Great Yarmouth, UK, Hawkes designed the one-atmosphere deep diving suit Wasp. Two years later, he designed the one-man microsubmersible Mantis, which included remote manipulator <b>arms.</b> A Mantis <b>sub</b> {{was used in the}} James Bond film [...] "For Your Eyes Only", which he himself piloted in a large tank at the Pinewood Studios, UK.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 1954 {{a member}} of the Ktzi'ot kibbutz drove a water truck across the border into Egypt and gave himself up to the Egyptians at Abu Aweigila. When {{questioned}} {{in the presence of a}} UN military observer he said that all the inhabitants of the kibbutz were soldiers: one captain, four NCOs, 65 men soldiers and fifteen women soldiers. They were <b>armed</b> with rifles, <b>sub</b> machine guns, light machine guns, mortars and anti-tank weapons.|$|R
50|$|At 9:45 am on 9 September 1942 at Ballyboden, Rathfarnham, County Dublin, O'Brien {{left his}} house and began getting into his car. As was {{customary}} among Garda√≠, Detective Sergeant O'Brien was unarmed. Three IRA men, wearing trenchcoats and <b>armed</b> with Thompson <b>sub</b> machine guns, came up the drive and opened fire. The shots from the Thompson smashed the windows of his car, wounding him. He alighted and ran for cover to the gate but before reaching it, he was shot by a single round to the head.|$|R
50|$|After Dillinger, Cowley {{was pressed}} to chase down Lester Gillis (Baby Face Nelson). Near Barrington, Illinois (northwest of Chicago) Nelson began chasing {{a car with}} two FBI agents (who were only lightly armed). One of the agents put a bullet through the {{radiator}} of Nelson's car. Cowley and another agent, Herman Hollis, arrived in another car and shot it out with Nelson. Cowley was <b>armed</b> with a <b>sub</b> machine gun and Hollis had a shotgun. Nelson, although repeatedly shot by Cowley and Hollis, walked across the road and shot both agents with his rifle.|$|R
50|$|Scout {{landings}} {{were done}} at night during the new moon. The men {{were brought to}} a lagoon by submarine, and came ashore with rubber paddle boats. (Goodyear invented inflatable rubber boats just for this purpose) They would bury the boats {{in the sand and}} begin recon. Their mission was to clear the area prior to the main Naval landing which would then take over the island. They stayed from 3 days to as long as 7 days engaging in covert operations and 'taking no prisoners'. They had learned martial arts (judo) and were <b>armed</b> with Thompson <b>sub</b> machine guns, sidearms and knives. The entire Navy Scouts program was strictly volunteer, since it was considered too dangerous to order men to do this job. When the island was secured, they would transmit code to the sub, which would pick them up the next night. A typical loss would be 12 men going in and 3-5 coming back alive. Sometimes only 1 would come back.|$|R
