5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time.

5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E
5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E

5|$|A more {{immediate}} need for <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier {{emerged in the}} 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model {{predictive}} control of open irrigation canals with constraints. The Saint-Venant equations {{are widely used}} in hydraulics to model <b>an</b> open <b>canal.</b> <b>As</b> a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations, they are not solved explicitly and difficult to design optimal control algorithms. In this work, a prediction model of <b>an</b> open <b>canal</b> is developed by discretizing the Saint-Venant equations in both space and time. Based on the prediction model, a constrained model predictive control was firstly investigated for the case of one single-pool canal and then generalized {{to the case of}} <b>a</b> cascaded <b>canal</b> with multipools. The hydraulic software SICC was used to simulate the canal and test the algorithms with application to <b>a</b> real-world irrigation <b>canal</b> of Yehe irrigation area located in Hebei province...|$|R
5|$|Another method {{adopted in}} the past to tackle the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water hyacinth include introducing weevils for the biological control of water hyacinth, which was carried out in collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling water hyacinth.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E
5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} {{was much better}} understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, {{who had been the}} engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, to carry out a survey. The cost of <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. <b>A</b> <b>canal</b> was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade to recoup those costs.|$|E

50|$|The main natural {{obstacles}} that interrupt or make navigation dangerous are: a basalt bank, hidden rocks, reduced current velocity, too little depth, <b>a</b> straight <b>canal</b> {{in the middle}} of the river, an elevated current velocity, an undulating movement, <b>a</b> sinuous <b>canal,</b> sand banks, and stretches with high gradient.|$|R
