Gordon toured the Northeast of the United States giving public speeches, {{starting}} <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> 15, including a speech in Boston at age 18. During one such event, she met a Scottish physician named Charles H. Gordon, and married him in 1862. They moved west gradually, first to New Orleans (where he was posted during the Civil War), then to Nevada, and finally settling in California in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population.

5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers were recruited from the Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, probably {{in the form of a}} fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although recruits <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> 14 are recorded, the majority of recruits (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E

5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate.

However, a cinder cone {{in the middle of}} the shield could be much younger, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, at 62, {{felt she}} {{was too old to}} travel to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E
5|$|The convict cichlid {{can reach}} sexual {{maturity}} <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> 16 weeks, though sexual maturity more commonly occurs at 6 months. Sexually mature convicts form monogamous pairs and spawn in small caves or crevices. In the wild, the fish excavate caves by moving earth from underneath large stones.

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including <b>As</b> <b>Young</b> <b>as</b> You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in increased interest in her films.|$|E
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E

5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E
