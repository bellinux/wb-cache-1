5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the frequency that diabetes is reported on death certificates of decedents with known diabetes and describe trends in reporting over 8 years. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS—Data {{were obtained from}} 11, 927 participants with diabetes who were enrolled in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes, a multicenter prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Data on decedents (N = 2, 261) {{were obtained from the}} National Death Index from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2007. The primary dependent variables were the presence of the ICD- 10 codes for diabetes listed anywhere on the death certificate or <b>as</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. RESULTS—Diabetes was recorded on 41 % of death certificates and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death for 13 % of decedents with diabetes. Diabetes was significantly more likely to be reported on the death certificate of decedents dying of cardiovascular disease than all other causes. There was a statistically significant trend of increased reporting <b>of</b> diabetes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death over time (P, 0. 001), which persisted after controlling for duration of diabetes at death. The increase in reporting <b>of</b> diabetes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death was associated with a decrease in the reporting of cardiovascular disease <b>as</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death (P, 0. 001) ...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; {{in the following year}} it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
