However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from <b>all</b> <b>eyes,</b> and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E

25|$|England’s innings {{proceeded}} well {{through the}} morning of day 2, with Ian Bell posting a fluent 83 before chipping a shot to midwicket. However, England then suffered a mini collapse, triggered by Muttiah Muralitharan, and slipped to 185/6 before rain curtailed the day’s play. By this point, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> were on Muralitharan {{who was on the}} verge of overtaking Shane Warne’s career haul of 708 test wickets.|$|E
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> were on Jack Martin for the Round 1 clash against Richmond but a {{shoulder}} injury in the fifth minute of the game ruled the talented teenage out {{for a minimum of}} two months. Despite the injury, the Gold Coast came out victorious against the Tigers by three goals. Mixed results followed as the Gold Coast entered Round 5 with a 2-2 record. The team would then make club history by recording five consecutive victories against Melbourne, Greater Western Sydney, North Melbourne, St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2005 English cricket season began, a resurgent English cricket team had won four Test series in a row, going unbeaten through the 2004 calendar year. The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. However, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> were on the Ashes. Australia still started as favourites, but England, {{for the first time in}} years, were expected to put up a real challenge to Aussie supremacy.|$|E

25|$|Two months later, Woods was {{the only}} player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the {{calendar}} Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. <b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> were on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes {{in the final round}} cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.|$|E

Third-seeded Novak Djoković {{came back from a}} one set deficit to Denis Gremelmayr to make it into the second round. James Blake, David Nalbandian and Nicolás Almagro proceeded to the next round in straight sets, while Andy Murray needed almost three hours to beat French wild card Jonathan Eysseric 6–2, 1–6, 4–6, 6–0, 6–2. 1998 French Open winner Carlos Moyá fell to qualifier Eduardo Schwank and Janko Tipsarević lost to Nicolás Lapentti.|$|E

He writes: [...] "'I'll Still Love You (When Every Song Is Sung)' looks forward to the time when all souls are 'free,' when <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> will 'see,' and when all human beings will be of the same mind.

500|$|By mid-1848, van Hoëvell {{had become}} too {{controversial}} and perhaps too important to those who disagreed with the local government, and {{under pressure from the}} Governor-General he resigned his post on 19 July 1848.

[...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude."

500|$|A brief {{flash of}} fire was visible {{to most of}} the ships in the convoy, and for several seconds, only smoke could be seen {{billowing}} from her hold. A few seconds later, a huge pillar of fire shot out of Burke's cargo hold, followed by an immense cloud of white smoke. Within seconds <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> were drawn to Burke where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated, instantly destroying the ship and killing her crew of 40 merchant marine sailors and 28 or 29 armed guards. For several seconds, Burke was not visible under an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke, fire and explosions. Several ships nearby were damaged by the force of the blast and flying fragments. The shock wave rocked the entire convoy, and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed. [...] A US Army [...] "FS" [...] type ship just aft of Burke was severely damaged by the blast, sinking before it could be identified. As the cloud of smoke cleared, nearby ships closed on Burkes former position to search for survivors. [...] It was soon clear that Burke, and all 68 men aboard her, were gone.|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kulikovsky {{was sent to the}} front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, [...] "...finish with the divorce now during the war while <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such a small thing would be lost in all the greater things". The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of Kiev, where she was stationed at a hospital. In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander, two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended. Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys. After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in Kharkov, Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.|$|E

40|$|Retinal {{information}} is two-dimensional, whereas eye movements are three-dimensional. The oculomotor system solves this degrees-of-freedom problem by constraining eye positions to zero torsion (Listing's law) and determining how eye velocities change with eye position (half-angle rule). Here we test whether the oculomotor plant, {{in the absence}} of well-defined neural commands, can implement these constrains mechanically, not just in a primary position but for <b>all</b> <b>eye</b> and head orientations. We stimulated the abducens nerve at tertiary eye positions and when ocular counterroll was induced at tilted head orientations. Stimulation-induced eye velocities follow the half-angle rule, even for tertiary eye positions, and microstimulation at tilted head orientations elicits eye positions that adhere to torsionally shifted planes, similar to naturally occurring eye movements. These results support the notion that oculomotor plant can continuously apply these three-dimensional rules correctly and appropriately for <b>all</b> <b>eye</b> and head orientations that obey Listing's law, demonstrating a major role of peripheral biomechanics in motor control...|$|R
