40|$|Objectives Although {{theoretical}} conceptualisations {{of animal}} hoarding have been published, few empirical {{studies have been}} conducted. The current study investigated animal hoarding {{from the perspectives of}} professionals who come into contact with people who hoard animals through their employment in various capacities, primarily in animal welfare. Design A qualitative research design was employed using inductive thematic analysis. Methods Twelve professionals who had experience working in animal hoarding were interviewed. Participants’ professions included: mental health nurse, vet, animal behaviour consultant, animal inspector, animal warden and animal welfare officer. Participants reported working in a diverse range of locations across the UK. Semi-structured interviews were conducted either in person or over the telephone. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim before analysis. Results Animal hoarding was conceptualised primarily by the presence of multiple animal neglect or suffering. The term ‘animal hoarding’ was used by participants to reflect those who are neglecting animals unintentionally, living in squalor, self-neglecting, experiencing distress or mental health problems, and using animals as a replacement for people. Animal hoarding appears to be maintained or repeated despite interventions from <b>animal</b> <b>professionals,</b> possibly because the human aspects of this issue are currently overlooked. Conclusions Better understanding and education, particularly on the human aspects of animal hoarding, are needed for both professionals and the public. Joint working and greater communication is needed in both directions between <b>animal</b> <b>professionals</b> and those working in mental health and social services. Practitioner Points • The findings suggest that animal hoarding should be given much greater attention, both clinically and in research, within the field of psychology. • There are social and mental health aspects of animal hoarding which are inadequately addressed by professionals in the UK currently. <b>Animal</b> <b>professionals</b> should be aware of psychological and social issues such as the mental capacity of individuals to make decisions about their animals. Social and psychological interventions should be offered to engage people who are hoarding animals, safeguard people living in animal hoarding situations, address social isolation or support network issues, relieve psychological distress from comorbid mental health problems, increase insight, and instigate behaviour change. • The current study is limited by the representation of only <b>professional</b> perspectives on <b>animal</b> hoarding. The perspectives of animal hoarders and their families are not represented. • There was a majority of <b>animal</b> <b>professionals</b> compared with mental health professionals interviewed in the current study which may have caused a paucity of information on the social and mental health aspects of <b>animal</b> hoarding and <b>professional</b> responses to this...|$|R

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> health <b>professional</b> use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} animal health and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> health <b>professional</b> have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in animal health, and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> health <b>professional's</b> activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for animal health are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions. This limits what can be understood on the productivity of the economic resources used for animal health and this needs to be addressed with more systematic collection of data on disease losses and costs of animal health systems. Ideally such a process should learn lessons from the way that human health has made estimates of the burden of diseases and their capture of data on the costs of human health systems. Once available data on the global burden of animal diseases and the costs of animal health systems would allow assessments of individual disease management processes and the productivity of wider productivity change. This utopia should be aimed at if animal health is to continue to attract and maintain adequate resources...|$|R
