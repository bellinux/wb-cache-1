25|$|Felsic and {{intermediate}} magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions {{driven by the}} release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite.

25|$|The Ordovician period {{gave rise}} to a {{sequence}} of sedimentary rocks which stretch from Pembrokeshire eastwards through Carmarthenshire up the Vale of Towy and which are intricately intermixed with those of the succeeding period northwards to the Vale of Conwy. In Snowdonia many Ordovician volcanic rocks give rise to a more rugged landscape than elsewhere in the country. Snowdon itself is largely formed of volcanic <b>ash</b> (<b>tuff)</b> with some sedimentary rock and igneous intrusions folded into a syncline. Cadair Idris is also largely formed of Ordovician igneous rocks. Anglesey and Llŷn are also Ordovician territory. The Ordovician rocks of Wales are typically intensely faulted and folded, having been affected by the earth movements of the Caledonian Orogeny.|$|E
25|$|The Intercaldera Sequence {{comprises}} formations that crop {{out from}} overlying flows in triangularly shaped area, and includes thick volcanic <b>ash</b> (<b>tuff),</b> thick breccia layers, and intermediate to felsic igneous rocks {{that tend to}} intrude the above layers and are typically located along caldera margin faults. The Exocaldera Sequence contains ash flow tuffs, mafic lavas, alluvial redbeds, and porphyritic felsic lavas that are distributed across five different layers. The late Caldera-Fill Sequence contains rocks {{that are similar to}} those of the outflows of the other, older layers, and comprises two formations and two relatively minor intrusive lava flows. The volcanic flows are generally mafic. The stratigraphic subdivision is supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, which indicate that the basaltic rocks are mantle-derived and have, unusually, relatively intraplate (or hotspot) type chemical affinities. The multiple andesite flows were probably derived from basaltic magma by the crystallization of the magma material. The relatively rare, more felsic flow units, are thought to have originated from high-end crystallization inside the magma chamber. The various stages of fractionation are continually interrupted by eruptions, and have allowed scientists to recognize seven stages of caldera development. The genesis of the caldera is related to a period of lithospheric thinning that followed the Acadian Orogeny in the northern Appalachians.|$|E
40|$|Vigorous {{hydrothermal}} activity interspersed by sequences of phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions occur at Whakaari (White Island volcano), New Zealand. Here, we investigate {{the influence of}} sample type (hydrothermally altered cemented <b>ash</b> <b>tuffs</b> and unconsolidated ash/lapilli) and fragmentation mechanism (steam flashing versus gas expansion) on fragmentation and ejection velocities {{as well as on}} particle-size and shape. Our rapid decompression experiments show that fragmentation and ejection speeds of two <b>ash</b> <b>tuffs,</b> cemented by alunite and amorphous opal, increase with increasing porosity and that both are significantly enhanced in the presence of steam flashing. Ejection speeds of unconsolidated samples are higher than ejection speeds of cemented tuffs, as less energy is consumed by fragmentation. Fragmentation dominated by steam flashing results in increased fragmentation energy and a higher proportion of fine particles. Particle shape analyses before and after fragmentation reveal that both steam flashing and pure gas expansion produce platy or bladed particles from fracturing parallel to the decompression front. Neither fragmentation mechanisms nor sample type show a significant influence on the shape. Our results emphasize that, under identical pressure and temperature conditions, eruptions accompanied by the process of liquid water flashing to steam are significantly more violent than those driven simply by gas expansion. Therefore, phase changes during decompression and cementation are both important considerations for hazard assessment and modeling of eruptions in hydrothermally active environments...|$|R
50|$|The earlier {{volcanism}} is {{from the}} Oligocene age of the Paleogene Period. It consists of largely intermediate composition lavas and breccias. A few <b>ash</b> flow <b>tuffs</b> also constitute this phase of volcanism.|$|R
5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and <b>ash</b> <b>tuffs</b> {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|R
2500|$|Magma that erupts from {{a volcano}} behaves {{according}} to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content {{and the amount of}} silica. [...] High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves {{in a manner similar to}} thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled <b>ash,</b> <b>tuff</b> and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.|$|E

40|$|The Eagle Mountains are a {{northwest}} trending block fault {{mountain range}} in southwestern Trans-Pecos, Texas. The central {{portion of this}} range is formed by Tertiary igneous rocks. The magmatic rocks represent intra-caldera facies of two eruptive cycles. Each cycle produced rhyolitic <b>ash</b> flow <b>tuffs</b> followed by trachytic volcanism. The Carpenter Canyon Tuff and Frenchman Canyon Trachyte represent the first cycle while the High Mill Tuff and Eagle Peak Syenite represent the second. A caldera was formed during each eruptive cycle. The Carpenter Canyon Tuff is composed mainly of rhyolitic <b>ash</b> flow <b>tuffs</b> with minor amounts of air fall tuffs and tuffaceous sandstones. The Frenchman Canyon Trachyte overlies the Carpenter Canyon Tuff and consists predominantly of trachyte porphyry lava flows and minor thin trachytic <b>ash</b> flow <b>tuffs.</b> The High Mill Tuff overlies the Frenchman Canyon Trachyte and consists of rhyolitic <b>ash</b> flow <b>tuffs.</b> The Eagle Peak Syenite, a syenite porphyry, intrudes the High Mill Tuff. The rocks of both eruptive cycles show a similar trend of compositional variation. The Carpenter Canyon Tuff and High Mill Tuff are richer in silica (72 % average) than the Frenchman Canyon Trachyte and Eagle Peak Syenite (66 % average). Rocks intermediate in composition are rare. Evidence indicates that the Eagle Mountains magmatic rocks represent volcanism from two zoned magma chambers which were filled by the same source. Caldera subsidence occurred during both periods of eruptive activity but evidence of resurgent doming is not apparent. The excellent exposure of intra-caldera facies is caused by Basin and Range tectonism and differential erosion...|$|R

5000|$|The Wrekin is a {{prominent}} hill {{near the town}} of Telford. The sedimentary rock types are varied around the area, but lava and volcanic <b>ash</b> (<b>tuff)</b> from various volcanic eruptions form this famous landmark. However, The Wrekin itself is not a volcano, and never was. The primary igneous rock on the Wrekin is rhyolite; this has a pinkish colour and is usually banded as it is a slow cooling viscous extrusive rock. A particularly good outcrop of rhyolite exists as you drive between Wellington and Shrewsbury on the new A5 by-pass. Intrusions of igneous rock have been quarried in the past at nearby Ercall Quarry. Here, the main type of igneous rock that can be found is Granophyre. At Ercall Quarry itself, you can see the contact (boundary) between Precambrian rocks and the younger (Cambrian) sedimentary rocks.

40|$|A new {{occurrence}} {{of a rare}} kamafugite near L’Aquila, Abruzzo, is described in detail to characterize its paragenesis and to establish possible genetic links with similar alkaline mafic igneous rocks from the Oricola-Camerata Nuova (OC) volcanic field, ~ 20 km to the west. Both occurrences belong to the Umbria-Latium-Ultralkaline-District (ULUD), an igneous district represented by rare kamafugites and carbonatites and distinct from the much more voluminous Roman Region (RR) rocks. The new kamafugite {{was found in a}} cave known as Grotta del Cervo (GC), associated with epiclastic and pyroclastic rocks. In the latter, lapilli <b>ash</b> <b>tuff,</b> welded lapilli, ultramafic xenoliths, cognate lithics and pelletal lapilli have been identified. The mineralogy of the welded lapilli comprises, in order of decreasing abundance, diopside, leucite, haüyne, Mg-mica, andraditic garnet, apatite, magnetite, kalsilite and olivine. The rock is carbonate-free. Based on bulk-rock chemistry it is classified as a kamafugite, closely approaching the composition of ULUD kamafugites, according to Sahama’s (1974) criteria. Separate lapilli <b>ash</b> <b>tuff,</b> characterized by the same silicate mineralogy as that of the welded lapilli, plus modal carbonate exceeding 10 wt. %, is classified as a carbonatitic kamafugite. Bulk-rock and trace-element compositions confirm that the Grotta del Cervo rocks closely approach the ULUD analogues. The Grotta del Cervo occurrence partially fills the geographical and compositional gap between ULUD rocks and the rocks from the Vulture Complex, also a carbonatite and melilitite locality ~ 200 km south of GC, and adds considerably to the bulk of kamafugitic and related rocks lying along the Italian Apennines. The petrogenesis of these kamafugites rocks is discussed and possible mineralogical similarities with the Roman Region rocks are highlighted...|$|E
