50|$|The tour {{featured}} a 75-minute set combining music from both Porter Robinson and Madeon into one enormous tapestry centered around a three-track core of Language, Technicolor, and Shelter. The set {{opened with a}} stripped-down bit of Language as the intro for Shelter and closed with an encore that mirrors the pattern via an <b>acoustic</b> <b>Shelter</b> transitioning into Language (with samples from Imperium). The main melodies from each song were featured throughout the show.|$|E
50|$|Bold Park {{is located}} on a {{calcareous}} coastal plain. Limestone formations in the park were quarried to provide stone for the growing population of Perth. The 640-person-capacity Quarry Amphitheatre utilises quarry walls for <b>acoustics</b> and <b>shelter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "arch sing" [...] is a casual, public performance, often held in an archway {{for reasons}} of <b>acoustics</b> and <b>shelter</b> from the weather. Typically, one or more a cappella groups will perform for a small audience, either as a concert or to promote {{upcoming}} concerts. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar casual, outdoor performances not held under arches.|$|R
40|$|The Logistics Reduction (LR) project {{within the}} Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) {{division}} is tasked with reducing logistical mass and repurposing logistical items. Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bags (MCTB) {{have been designed}} such that they can serve the same purpose as a Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB), the common logistics carrying bag for the International Space Station (ISS). After use as a cargo carrier, a regular CTB becomes trash, whereas the MCTB can be unfolded into a flat panel for reuse. Concepts and potential benefits for various MCTB applications will be discussed including partitions, crew quarters, solar radiation storm <b>shelters,</b> <b>acoustic</b> blankets, and forward osmosis water processing. Acoustic MCTBs are currently in use on ISS to reduce the noise generated by the T 2 treadmill, which reaches the hazard limit at high speeds. The development of the AMCTB included identification of keep out zones, acoustic properties, deployment considerations, and structural testing. Features developed for these considerations are applicable to MCTBs for all crew outfitting applications...|$|R
40|$|Rapid, remote, {{acoustic}} survey techniques are being increasingly {{used to study}} marine habitats. The techniques provide wide-area coverage of the seafloor and discrimination of bottom type when carefully calibrated to ground truth biology and sedimentology. One of these techniques involves the analysis of first and second echoes from the vessel’s echo sounder using the ECHOplus Seabed Discrimination System. In order to evaluate this acoustic system a survey was conducted in Hopavågen, a confined bay 80 km west of Trondheim, {{on the coast of}} Norway. The principal objective of the survey was to assess the use of a single-beam acoustic technique for habitat mapping. The bay provides an ideal location for <b>acoustic</b> surveying with <b>sheltered</b> conditions, discrete biotope and sediment bottom types covering large areas with small topographic variations. In this paper we present a description of the ECHOplus hardware, digital signal processing technique (DSP), the Hardness & Roughness algorithms and the results of calibration and surveying using the single-beam echo sounder. An acoustic map of bottom reflectance (hardness and roughness) was generated and compared to biological and sedimentological ground truth data obtained from grab, diver and video surveying. The results exhibit excellent correlation between acoustic bottom classed type and ground truth data...|$|R
