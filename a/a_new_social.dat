5|$|Power: <b>A</b> <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> Analysis by Bertrand Russell (1st imp. London 1938, Allen & Unwin, 328 pp.) {{is a work}} {{in social}} {{philosophy}} written by Bertrand Russell. Power, for Russell, is one's ability to achieve goals. In particular, Russell has in mind social power, that is, power over people.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{memorials}} {{commemorate the}} events and the casualties of World War I. These war memorials include civic memorials, larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private memorials {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those involved in the conflict. Huge numbers of memorials were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. This was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> phenomenon and marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its memorials faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing memorials and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many memorials increased significantly, while major national and civic memorials continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|E

25|$|The {{hallmark}} of Khosrow's bureaucratic reform {{was the creation}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> class. Before, the Sasanian Empire consisted of only three social classes, magi, nobles, and peasants/commoners. Khosrow added a fourth class to this hierarchy between the nobles and the peasants, called the deghans. The deghans were small land owning citizens of the Sasanian Empire and were considered lower nobility.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Flower's brother {{opened a}} {{sanatorium}} in Boston and moved there with him. At this time, Flower {{returned to the}} world of publishing, launching a new literary magazine called The American Spectator. This venture proved successful, achieving a circulation of more than 10,000 copies within three years. In December 1889, Flower merged this publication into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> reform magazine he launched called The Arena.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 1962, Sicco Mansholt, the European Commissioner for Agriculture, sent a {{memorandum}} to the Council of Ministers concerning agricultural {{reform in the}} European Community.

25|$|The Iron Age {{allowed for}} easier {{cultivation}} and thus new areas were cleared {{as the population}} grew with the increased harvests. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> structure evolved: when sons married, they would remain in the same house; such an extended family was a clan. They would offer protection from other clans; if conflicts arose, the issue would be decided at a thing, a sacred place where all freemen from the surrounding area would assemble and could determine punishments for crimes, such as paying fines in food.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution {{opened the}} way for cataclysmic change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It saw a period of {{unprecedented}} debate in a burgeoning press. The revolution created new opportunities and opened up seemingly boundless possibilities for Persia’s future. Many different groups fought to shape the course of the Revolution, and all sections of society were ultimately to be in some way changed by it. The old order, which king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar had struggled for so long to sustain, finally died, to be replaced by new institutions, new forms of expression, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> and political order.|$|E

25|$|Addams {{had long}} discussions with philosopher John Dewey {{in which they}} redefined {{democracy}} in terms of pragmatism and civic activism, with an emphasis more on duty and less on rights. The two leading perspectives that distinguished Addams and her coalition from the modernizers more concerned with efficiency were the need to extend to social and economic life the democratic structures and practices that had been limited to the political sphere, as in Addams' programmatic support of trade unions; and second, their call for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> ethic to supplant the individualist outlook as being no longer adequate in modern society.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} {{systemic}} agriculture {{coincided with the}} introduction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> system called feudalism. This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations. Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latter's protection. This made for confusion of territorial sovereignty since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory. Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records. Even land ownership disputes were decided based solely on oral testimony. Territoriality was reduced to a network of personal allegiances.|$|E

25|$|The TM {{movement}} also {{operates a}} worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, and herbal supplement, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities. The global organization {{is reported to}} have an estimated net worth of USD 3.5 billion. The TM movement has been characterized {{in a variety of ways}} and has been called a spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millenarian movement, a world affirming movement, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> movement, a guru-centered movement, a personal growth movement, a religion, and a cult, with one observer disputing the cult label. Participation in TM programs does not require a belief system and is practiced by people from a diverse group of religious affiliations.|$|E
25|$|The game uses Autolog, the competition-between-friends system {{developed}} by Criterion for , and since {{used in other}} titles in the Need for Speed series. Autolog in Most Wanted plays a larger role and gives more information to players. Activities in-game allow players to earn Speed Points which can boost players up on the Most Wanted list. Autolog recommendations have now been integrated into the game world, rather than sit externally on the menu system. Most Wanted features <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> system called Cloudcompete, which strings together Most Wanted across all platforms in an inspired example of cross-compatibility. One profile is used for all versions of the game, allowing the player to rank up on one format and continue progress on another.|$|E
25|$|The city, {{which at}} that time had about 70,000 inhabitants, saw itself {{transformed}} overnight. The additional populace, full of new requirements, imposed a new organization in the supply of food and other consumer goods, including luxury items. It took years for the Portuguese to settle in, causing years of chaos in the daily life of Rio; rents doubled, taxes rose, and food was in short supply, requisitioned by the imported nobility. This soon dispelled popular enthusiasm over the prince regent's arrival. The very shape of the city began to change, {{with the construction of}} innumerable new residences, villas and other buildings, and various improvements to services and infrastructure. Likewise, the presence of the court introduced new standards of etiquette, new fashions and new customs, including <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> stratification.|$|E
