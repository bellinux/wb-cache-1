Flight Simulator was used to familiarize the student with aerodynamic principles, the relationship between aircraft controls and displays and flight dynamics. Both the syllabus incorporating the flight simulation and the capabilities of the simulation are described. The authors examined the capabilities of the simulations and feel that they provide an excellent return for a comparatively small investment. Students felt that the ability to use a simulator greatly enhanced the course. The simulations have potential applications which remain to be tapped. As a teaching aid, it is rated "best buy"...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the optimal fit between technical innovations in aviation and aircraft operators. Because {{of the increase}} in computerization, an accurate and efficient monitoring of the automation poses a key challenge to future operators. As the German Aerospace Center’s Department of <b>Aviation</b> and Space <b>Psychology</b> is responsible for personnel selection of pilots and air traffic controllers, our objective for the selection of future personnel is to distinguish good monitoring operators from bad operators. In order to identify good monitoring behavior we developed a simulation tool that represents tasks of pilots and controllers within a dynamic air traffic flow. Participants have either to monitor the automatic process or to control the dynamic traffic manually. Monitoring behavior is measured by recording eye movement parameters. The identification of accurate monitoring behavior enables us to adapt selection profiles to future ability requirements...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Objectives for the {{workshop}} are: To deepen participants' {{understanding of human}} factors (HF) approaches To {{provide an overview of}} current debates, developments and future directions To empower attendees to be HF champions, taking a broad view of its multi-dimensional properties To examine training for care and compassion from the perspective of non-technical skills HF as usually applied to safety comes from a particular technical/rational perspective borrowing from <b>aviation,</b> engineering, cognitive <b>psychology</b> and Artificial Intelligence (‘information processing’ in particular). These traditional approaches privilege the internal (cognitive, abstract) over the external (social, environmental) and have been criticised as dehumanizing and reductive. Recent developments in HF emphasise the complexity of healthcare and examine how this shapes and constrains the behaviour of those who work in it. We will enable workshop attendees to engage with these developments in the HF field which have strong implications for its continued applicability and effectiveness in medical simulation. The course material is distilled from a two day Human Factors (HF) course which was developed and piloted in 2013 with funding from a UK Deanery. Attendees have included risk managers, doctors, nurses, patient representatives and hospital administrators and feedback has been excellent. </p...|$|R

40|$|Musicians tend {{to strive}} for {{flawless}} performance and perfection, avoiding errors at all costs. Dealing with errors while practicing or performing is often frustrating {{and can lead to}} anger and despair, which can explain musicians’ generally negative attitude toward errors and the tendency to aim for errorless learning in instrumental music education. But even the best performances are rarely error-free, and research in general pedagogy and psychology has shown that errors provide useful information for the learning process. Research in instrumental pedagogy is still neglecting error issues; the benefits of risk management (before the error) and error management (during and after the error) are still underestimated. It follows that dealing with errors is a key aspect of music practice at home, teaching, and performance in public. And yet, to be innovative, or to make their performance extraordinary, musicians need to risk errors. Currently, most music students only acquire the ability to manage errors implicitly - or not at all. A more constructive, creative and differentiated culture of errors would balance error tolerance and risk-taking against error prevention in ways that enhance music practice and music performance. The teaching environment should lay the foundation for the development of these abilities. In this contribution, we survey recent research in <b>aviation,</b> medicine, economics, <b>psychology,</b> and interdisciplinary decision theory that has demonstrated that specific error-management training can promote metacognitive skills that lead to better adaptive transfer and better performance skills. We summarize how this research can be applied to music, and survey relevant research that is specifically tailored to the needs of musicians, including generic guidelines for risk and error management in music teaching and performance. On this basis, we develop a conceptual framework for risk management that can provide orientation for further music education and musi...|$|R

50|$|Prior to World War I, {{the focus}} of <b>aviation</b> <b>psychology</b> was on the aviator himself, but the war shifted the focus onto the aircraft, in particular, the design of {{controls}} and displays, {{and the effects of}} altitude and environmental factors on the pilot. The war saw the emergence of aeromedical research and the need for testing and measurement methods. Studies on driver behaviour started gaining momentum during this period, as Henry Ford started providing millions of Americans with automobiles. Another major development during this period was the performance of aeromedical research. By the end of World War I, two aeronautical labs were established, one at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas and the other at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton, Ohio. Many tests were conducted to determine which characteristic differentiated the successful pilots from the unsuccessful ones. During the early 1930s, Edwin Link developed the first flight simulator. The trend continued and more sophisticated simulators and test equipment were developed. Another significant development was in the civilian sector, where the effects of illumination on worker productivity were examined. This led to the identification of the Hawthorne Effect, which suggested that motivational factors could significantly influence human performance.|$|E

40|$|Aviation {{remains one}} of the most active and {{challenging}} domains for human factors and applied psychology. Since 1981, the biennial International Symposium on <b>Aviation</b> <b>Psychology</b> (ISAP) has been convened for the purposes of (a) presenting the latest research on human performance problems and opportunities within aviation systems, (b) envisioning design solutions that best utilize human capabilities for creating safe and efficient aviation systems, and (c) bringing together scientists, research sponsors, and operators in an effort to bridge the gap between research and application. Though rooted in the presentations of the 17 th ISAP, held in 2013 in Dayton, Ohio, Advances in <b>Aviation</b> <b>Psychology</b> is not simply a collection of selected proceeding papers. Based upon the potential impact on emerging trends, current debates or enduring issues present in their work, select authors were invited to expand on their work following the benefit of interactions at the symposium. The invited authors include the featured keynote and plenary speakers who are all leading scientists and prominent researchers that were selected to participate at the symposium. These contributions are supplemented by additional contributors whose work best reflects significant developments in <b>aviation</b> <b>psychology.</b> Consequently the volume includes visions for the next generation of air management and air traffic control, the integration of unmanned (i. e. remotely piloted vehicles) into operational air spaces, and the use of advanced information technologies (e. g. synthetic task environments) for research and training.

He proved that drivers’ sensory and brain functions can be affected by the low-oxygen at the altitude around 4, 000 meters (Lin et al., 1981). He also found that depth perception error increased with the increase of altitude (Lin, 1986). Whether in the plains or on the plateau, high work load would result in decreased depth perception function of the drivers. He also summarized and analyzed the physical and mental status of the human beings on the plateau, including the influences of low-oxygen on sensory perception, complex mental activity, and central nervous system (Lin, 1988). These studies made substantial contributions to the development of scientific research in the plateau areas.|$|E
