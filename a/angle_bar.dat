40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{interception efficiency}} of a gully grating decreases with the steepness {{of the road}} on which it is installed. This {{can lead to a}} higher potential for flooding at the downstream area of a steep road. In this study, the hydraulic inception efficiency of several types of gully gratings on steep roads, including a new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was investigated experimentally. The experimental results for all test gratings show that the hydraulic interception efficiency varies linearly with a non-dimensional parameter expressed as a product of the Froude number, water depth to grating length ratio and flow width to grating width ratio. The empirical relationship can be easily included in numerical models for the detailed study and design of storm water drainage systems. The hydraulic performance of the grating with longitudinal bars and the new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was better than that of the existing grating. The relative increase in the efficiency increases with the flow velocity, depth and width. While gratings with longitudinal bars may induce inconvenience to cyclists, gratings with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section may be used on steep roads to enhance the hydraulic interception efficiency of gullies.

40|$|Soil Nailing is a {{technique}} for reinforcing soil in situ, increasingly utilised as an economical alternative to conventional earth reinforcing techniques. However, today the design {{is based on an}} assumed value of the pullout capacity of nails, which later is verified by pullout tests during the construction, which in turn limits the possibility of optimising the design. The objective of this study was therefore to get {{a better understanding of the}} pullout capacity and to suggest a method for more accurate prediction. The study comprised; laboratory tests (to study the influence of overburden pressure, relative density and method of installation) and full-scale field tests (to compare the pullout capacity among different soil nails and with results of site investigation methods). The results were then compared with design methods and results from FEM analysis. The results show that the pullout capacity in a cohesionless soil mainly depends on; the coefficient of roughness, surface area and normal stress. An increase in relative density, overburden pressure, and volume of displaced soil will result in an increase in pullout capacity. The coefficient of roughness and surface area could be estimated with quite good accuracy while the normal stress against the nail is more difficult to determine. The best prediction of the pullout capacity seems to be obtained from pullout tests on vertical nails. The greatest pullout capacity was, as expected obtained for grouted nails, but at the test carried out about 300 days after installation a driven expansion bolt and the <b>angle</b> <b>bar</b> gave an almost equals high capacity. A significantly lower pullout capacity was obtained for the ribbed bars, and for these nails no time dependency could be found.

ABSTRACT: An {{attempt was made to}} design a low cost floating house suitable for people in low lying areas such as Bangladesh. The prototype house considered for the present study has the carrying capacity of 1850 kg loads with sufficient freeboard of 30 % excluding the self weights of the supporting ten airtight empty steel drums in water and having a floor area of 120 ft 2. These steel drums that are locally available and provide an atmosphere to live in without the fear of losing possession during flood. The value of metacentric height (10. 22 ft) of the designed house was found to be positive indicating its stability at floating condition. The angular displacement of the house due to wind action was also calculated and this floating structure would be stable up to the wind speed of about 160 km/hr. To provide sanitation a floating toilet can be hinged with the structure. It would definitely give an eco-friendly out look to the structure. For variable fencing, flooring, roofing and floating elements costs were estimated to determine the most economic feasibility.

Guidance tests were conducted with bar racks and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm bar rack ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm bar rack decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid bottom overlay placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both bar racks and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that <b>angled</b> <b>bar</b> racks and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|R
