We can look <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{the eye and}} finally say {{on behalf of the}} American people, what the United States {{government}} did was shameful, and I am sorry ... To our African American citizens, I am sorry that your federal government orchestrated a study so clearly racist."Five of the eight study survivors attended to the White House ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, during the Regency {{of the future}} King George IV, the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George Beau Brummel. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form. [...] The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight {{trousers}} to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on {{the form of the}} body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, [...] "If people turn to look <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the street, you are not well dressed." [...] This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes. [...] Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Posts Allison Stewart {{writes that}} the album [...] "cribs heavily from vintage R. Kelly {{in the same way}} its predecessor,... Love Hate, {{borrowed}} from Purple Rain-era Prince". The track [...] "Kelly's 12 Play" [...] references R. Kelly's 1993 album 12 Play. In an interview for DJBooth, The-Dream discussed his musical approach to the album, stating [...] "This album's gonna be the same thing– a little more beefed up, I'm just gonna give you more. Every album I'm just gonna try to give you more of me, and what I think about certain things... This album is just gonna be the first album on some out of this world crack, basically". In an interview for The Village Voice, he discussed his use of melody, repetition, and hooks, relating it to child discipline, saying that [...] "Americans are not the biggest listeners. I didn't listen, which is why my granddaddy beat me half the time. It's only when the belt is swinging <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the same repetitive manner that you actually start to listen. So it's all about creating a belt on the song that repetitiously swings at you. It doesn't mean that in between the belt swinging, I'm not saying stuff that means something".|$|E
