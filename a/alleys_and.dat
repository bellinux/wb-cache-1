5|$|Despite the {{domination}} of the print industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No.18 Fleet Street in 1905. Since the post-Wapping migration, Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. For example, The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers are down <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> around courtyards off Fleet Street itself {{and many of the}} old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, on 8 July 2014, Universal {{opened a}} Harry Potter-themed {{area at the}} Universal Studios Florida theme park. It {{includes}} a re-creation of Diagon Alley and connecting <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> a small section of Muggle London. The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride. Universal also added a completely functioning recreation of the Hogwarts Express connecting Kings Cross Station at Universal Studios Florida to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley contain many shops and restaurants from the book series, including Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and The Leaky Cauldron.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Texas Tech grew {{slowly in}} the early years. During the 1930s, Bradford Knapp, the university's second president, {{proceeded}} with an expansion program, which included new dormitories, the first library (now the mathematics building), a golf course, a swimming pool, paved streets and <b>alleys,</b> <b>and</b> landscaping. A proposed $80,000 allocation for a football stadium was shelved. The library won the approval of Governor James V. Allred. Because the state cut appropriations by 30% {{at the start of}} the Great Depression, President Knapp applied for assistance from the major New Deal agencies to expand Texas Tech, including the Works Progress Administration, Public Works Administration (PWA), Civil Works Administration, and the National Youth Administration. Wyatt C. Hedrick, son-in-law of Governor Ross S. Sterling, was the architect of all campus PWA projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{is located in}} the district of St Giles, a short distance to the east of the east end of Oxford Street. The area was once notorious for being one of the worst slums in London, known as the Rookery – a maze of ramshackle houses, <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> courtyards inhabited by thousands of destitute people. It was famously depicted by William Hogarth in his 1751 print Gin Lane. Central Saint Giles stands on the site of St Giles Court, an office development originally erected in the 1950s for the Ministry of Supply and latterly used by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It consisted of a series of linked brick blocks of six to eight storeys high, arranged in an S-shape around two inner courtyards to which there was no public access. The grim appearance of St Giles Court contributed to the area becoming a magnet for prostitutes and the homeless. The building was owned by Legal & General but was occupied by the MOD on a lease that was not due to expire until 2011. However, {{at the start of the}} 21st century the MOD began undertaking a process of reducing its London estate and discontinued the use of several buildings in the capital, including St Giles Court. It vacated the building in April 2005.|$|E

He exits, jumps onto a police car, and rides it back to the dumpster, when he jumps in moments before a man walks into the <b>alley</b> <b>and</b> dumps a bag of trash into the dumpster.|$|R

25|$|While some errors {{might not}} have caused problems, others, such as the {{inclusion}} of bridges that no longer existed and misunderstanding the usefulness of minor British roads, would have been detrimental to German operations, and would have added to the confusion caused by the layout of Britain's cities (with their maze of narrow roads and <b>alleys)</b> <b>and</b> the removal of road signs.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden of}} Catherine de' Medici was an {{enclosed}} space five hundred metres long and three hundred metres wide, {{separated from the}} new chateau by a lane.

25|$|Oia typifies the white-painted {{houses of}} the Cyclades, in many cases built {{directly}} into niches which are cave houses used by crew of the ships, {{on the lip of}} the volcanic crater, between which are narrow <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> blue-roofed churches with cupolas. The wealthy ship captains of the late 19th century built neo-classical mansions. These houses are seen built in succession one above the other.|$|E

The goblin begins breakdancing (now played by Pockemon crew breakdancer, Lilou) on the stage.

25|$|Innovatively, {{the report}} {{recommended}} that some areas should change their outlook; rather than facing onto the street, shops could face onto squares or pedestrianised streets, with roof top or multi-storey parking nearby.

25|$|The police {{believed}} the Ripper {{was a local}} Whitechapel resident. His apparent ability to disappear immediately after the killings suggests an intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel neighbourhood, including its back <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> hiding places. However, the population of Whitechapel was transient, impoverished and often used aliases. The lives of many of its residents were little recorded. Despite continued interest in the case, as well as ongoing investigation by both professional and amateur researchers, the Ripper's true identity will almost certainly never be known.|$|E

Features included a theater for five hundred, where the chess tournament was held, a ballroom, a solarium, two gymnasiums, bowling <b>alleys</b> <b>and</b> an indoor pool. The hotel grounds were equally impressive, featuring a nine-hole golf course and a man-made lake.|$|E
