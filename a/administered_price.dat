With {{the dismantling of the}} <b>administered</b> <b>price</b> mechanism for petroleum products from 1 April 2002, subsidies in respect of LPG and kerosene distributed through the Public Distribution System are now explicitly reflected in the budget. This partially explains the spurt of 35.3 per cent in the expenditure on major subsidies in 2002-03. The spurt in major subsidies in 2002-03 was also because of an increase in food subsidy by Rs. 66.77 billion necessitated by the widespread drought in the country. Some of the major initiatives taken so far to rationalise the budgetary subsidies include targeted approach to food subsidy (BPL families) under Public Distribution System, allowing Food Corporation of India (FCI) to access market loans carrying lower interest rates, encouraging private trade in food grains, liquidating excess food grain stocks, replacing unit based retention price scheme with a group based scheme in the case of fertiliser subsidies and proposed phasing out of subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG.

5000|$|When Keynes {{published}} his General Theory in 1936, {{the influence of}} free market economics on policy making had already declined substantially compared to the almost unchallenged ascendancy it had enjoyed in Britain during the 1840s - 1860s. [...] By the mid-1930s much {{of the first and}} second world was already under the sway of communism or fascism, with even the US departing from economic orthodoxy with the New Deal. There had not been a corresponding decline for neoclassical economics in the academic sphere however. According to economic historian Richard Cockett, within academia the prestige of free market economics was still near its peak even in the 1920s. In the 1930s neoclassical economics began to be challenged within academia, though at first by various diverse schools which apart from Marxism were mostly of only local influence - such as the Stockholm school in Sweden or in the US the <b>Administered</b> <b>price</b> theorists [...] In 1930, Keynes was in his late forties, and in October his A Treatise on Money was published. It was criticized by Ralph Hawtrey, Dennis Robertson and Friedrich Hayek. However, so-called [...] "Circus", consisted of Richard Kahn, James Meade, Piero Sraffa, Joan Robinson and Austin Robinson, began a seminar to examine the Tratise. Keynes did not attend these seminars but was informed of their discussions by Kahn. Keynes was little influenced by the various heterodox economists of the 1930s, his General theory was written largely in a Marshellian framework though with some important points of dissent such as the idea that excessive savings can be harmful for the overall economy. Keynes asserts that when savings exceed available investment opportunities it makes it impossible for business as a whole to make a profit and so lay offs and increased unemployment will result. In chapter 23 of the General Theory Keynes traces the genesis of this idea to, among others, Mercantilist thinkers of the previous three centuries, to the Fable of the Bees and to the dissenting economist J A Hobson with his Physiology of industry (1889).|$|E

Consequently, Eurostat began to publish a new series of {{inflation}} indices referred to as the HIPC-AP in early 2010 that summarizes the development of publicly <b>administered</b> <b>prices.</b> This study presents a detailed account of the concept underlying the new series and provides a cross-country analysis for the euro area. <b>Administered</b> <b>prices</b> are a key component of the HICP basket, currently accounting for 11. 0 % of the HICP (euro area average). This share has declined in the past decade in line with the liberalization of goods and service markets. The inflation rates of <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> and those of flexible prices (i. e. the HICP excluding <b>administered</b> <b>prices)</b> differ with respect to both their levels and their development over time. In many euro area countries, the average HICP-AP rate of inflation has surpassed the all-items HICP inflation rate over the past ten years. In Austria, as in other euro area countries, flexible prices are found to be a leading indicator for the HICP rather than vice-versa. As public sector pricing takes place within a macroeconomic context, this study also represents a first effort to shed light on the main economic determinants of the development of the HICP-AP.

Regressions controlling for various shocks revealed that significant relative price changes [...] especially the large <b>administered</b> <b>price</b> increases associated with adjustment [...] produced substantial upward inflationary pressures. Growth in money and wages were shown to fuel inflation.

And the adjustment of many controlled prices is not yet complete. Ideally, future administered increases should be frequent and moderate to prevent the large price shifts that increase inflation. But because frequent price increases are likely to be politically unpopular, sizable increases may be in order so that the current underevaluation of numerous services will diminish more quickly.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{monetary}} policy in most economies {{of the world is}} to achieve and maintain price stability. This paper evaluates price developments and consumer price indices in south-eastern European countries, i. e. countries that have either recently joined the EU or are candidate or potential candidate countries. It is motivated by the fact that, in transition countries, inflation has generally been higher and more volatile than in advanced economies. The analysis reveals that the subindex housing/energy appears to be the main driving force behind overall inflation in the region. In most of the countries under review, <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> prove to be an important factor in consumer price developments, with their weights increasing over time. Inflation volatility in south-eastern Europe is significantly higher than in the euro area. While this is partly due to a higher level of inflation, it also reflects a more pronounced share for the most volatile sub-indices as well as the marked impact of <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> on the overall price index, a phenomenon which has also been seen in the central and eastern European countries. While in most south-eastern European countries no HICP has been calculated yet, there is little evidence suggesting that the future use of the HICP will result in a systematic change in inflation patterns in the respective countries. However, as deviations have been observed in a few countries for certain periods, without further information on the structure of the respective national CPI and the HICP such differences cannot be fully excluded.
