5|$|Whedon {{was also}} keen on {{utilizing}} vertical space; thus, having the crew's quarters accessible by ladder was important. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> {{of the set}} design was that it also allowed the actors {{to stay in the}} moment and interact, without having to stop after each shot and reset up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.|$|E
5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefits</b> of the XRX Web {{application}} architecture {{is that it}} avoids {{most of the problems}} around the object-relational impedance mismatch.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Trusts and {{fiduciary}} duties matter when property is managed by one person for <b>another's</b> <b>benefit.</b> Most trust money, which is invested by financial institutions around the City's Royal Exchange, comes from people saving for retirement. In 2011, UK pension funds held over £1 trillion of assets, and unit trusts held £583.8 billion.|$|R
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where <b>another</b> <b>benefit</b> match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> is its {{prefetch}} buffer, {{which is}} 8-burst-deep. In contrast, the prefetch buffer of DDR2 is 4-burst-deep, and the prefetch buffer of DDR is 2-burst-deep. This advantage is an enabling technology in DDR3's transfer speed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of some {{renewable}} energy technologies, like {{wind and solar}} photovoltaics (PV) is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric (fossil fuel based) power plants require vast amounts of water for operation.|$|E
50|$|That TENCAP and TIARA {{complement}} one <b>another,</b> and <b>benefit</b> tactical {{and strategic}} units.|$|R

25|$|Relatively easy {{dissection}} of the flap. Bilateral flap {{harvest is}} possible with patient in supine position. The scar is well {{hidden in the}} groin crease. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of the surgery is the ‘inner thigh lift’ the patients receive.|$|E
25|$|Japan's highly {{acclaimed}} post-war {{education system}} contributed strongly to the modernizing process. The world's highest literacy rate and high education standards were major reasons for Japan's success in achieving a technologically advanced economy. Japanese schools also encouraged discipline, <b>another</b> <b>benefit</b> in forming an effective work force.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> {{cited by}} DMK is the {{substantial}} profits the State has received from foreign investments {{since the start}} of the liberalisation process. According to a party statement, of the total investment of Rs.13,150,170 millions that has flowed into the country since liberalisation began, Tamil Nadu has received 1,511,870 millions, which is 11.5 per cent of the total investment in the country.|$|E

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> {{from the}} Shemp era was that Larry was given {{more time on}} screen. Throughout most of the Curly era, Larry was relegated to a {{background}} role, {{but by the time}} that Shemp rejoined the Stooges, Larry was allotted equal footage, even becoming the focus of several films, in particular Fuelin' Around (1949) and He Cooked His Goose (1952).|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, the cast of Corner Gas {{performed}} a fund-raising benefit event for Regina's Globe Theatre called Corner Gas...Live, in which the cast performed a live episode of the TV series. The popularity of the hit sitcom caused such a rush for tickets that the Globe Theatre's online ticket sales system briefly went down as a result. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> was held during {{the summer of}} 2007.|$|E
25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|E

25|$|Postconstructivism {{benefited from}} a natural {{reaction}} against both the avantgarde and the eclectics of the past. It was perceived as new, {{and at the same}} time allowed grand buildings that were to the taste of provincial elite. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> in a time of total rationing was that, unlike Constructivism, the new style minimized use of steel and cement, turning back to primitive masonry with wooden floors and partitions. This helps explain the spread of Postconstructivism in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing train length {{and the number}} of axles per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|His {{success with}} Grappelli allowed him more freedom in his career. He reduced {{some of his}} {{commitments}} and relocated to Scotland where he still lives. (He is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Scottish.) <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of his Grappelli association was {{that he began to}} tour North America regularly, helping him reach a new audience and build new relationships. He came to know musicians such as Chet Atkins and David Grisman, with whom he would both record, while another contact financed the production of an album, Sarabanda. The album received substantial airplay but financial difficulties at the record label prevented any major success.|$|E
500|$|The plain {{intention}} [...] was {{to abolish}} slavery of whatever name and form {{and all its}} badges and incidents; to render impossible any state of bondage; to make labor free, by prohibiting that control by which the personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for <b>another's</b> <b>benefit,</b> which {{is the essence of}} involuntary servitude. While the Amendment was self-executing, so far as its terms were applicable to any existing condition, Congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>benefit</b> {{of using}} a charge trapping cell is that the thin charge trapping layer reduces capacitive coupling between neighboring cells to improve performance and scalability.|$|R
50|$|Exall v Partridge (1799) 101 ER 1405 is an English unjust {{enrichment}} law case, concerning enrichment through discharge of a debt, and the unjust factor of legal compulsion to give <b>another</b> a <b>benefit.</b>|$|R
25|$|This system {{provides}} an on-bus smart card and cash-based revenue management system {{which will help}} to record data such as passenger behaviour, popular routes and type of tickets purchased. The system will also assist with the dispatching of drivers and post-shift cash-ups. Passengers can now buy smart cards at Soweto operations and mobile vendors at R30 each. The Smart Card can be re-charged with a weekly, monthly or season ticket. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of the smart card is that a passenger can use it (once it is re-charged), multiple times. The card fits into a pocket or purse, is very secure and cannot be read or copied.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of boosting, in {{addition}} to making weapons smaller, lighter, and with less fissile material for a given yield, is that it renders weapons immune to radiation interference (RI). It was discovered in the mid-1950s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial predetonation if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion (electronics might also be damaged, {{but this was a}} separate problem). RI was a particular problem before effective early warning radar systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless. Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in a weapon to below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect.|$|E
25|$|In villages the VC and NVA {{followed}} the same 2-belt approach, placing defenses so they were integrated with village homes and structures. This took advantage of some US Rules of Engagement limiting or delaying the use of heavy weapons in inhabited areas. <b>Another</b> <b>benefit</b> of embedding defenses among civilians was that atrocities could be charged if civilian structures were hit by US or ARVN fire. Numerous dummy positions were also constructed to draw ARVN and American fire. In more remote areas, defensive fortifications were more elaborate, sometimes incorporating a third belt of defenses with stronger bunkers and trench systems. US attacks against such tough positions sought to avoid US casualties by relying upon firepower.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>benefit</b> is {{the improved}} sustainability {{of the local}} organization providing microfinance services to very poor communities. Their ability to sustain and grow their operations is directly linked {{to the health of}} their clients.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> {{potential}} <b>benefit</b> of decentralizing {{authority is}} as Spillane et al. describe: [...] "The interactions among {{two or more}} leaders in carrying out a particular task may amount to {{more than the sum}} of those leaders’ practice." ...|$|R
50|$|Battlefield dymamics require {{portable}} power. Conventional diesel generators are {{too heavy}} {{for use in the}} field. Scalability allows TPVs to be smaller and lighter than conventional generators. Also, TPVs have few emissions and are silent. Multifuel operation is <b>another</b> potential <b>benefit.</b>|$|R
