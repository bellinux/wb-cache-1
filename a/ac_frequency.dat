25|$|This {{extraordinary}} strong {{frequency dependence}} {{can be explained}} by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing <b>AC</b> <b>frequency.</b> Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E
25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a single-phase supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the <b>AC</b> <b>frequency</b> from the output.|$|E

50|$|These {{mechanical}} rectifiers were {{noisy and}} had high maintenance requirements. The moving parts had friction, which required lubrication and replacement due to wear.

40|$|Control of bulk melt {{crystal growth}} {{techniques}} is desirable for producing semiconductors {{with the highest}} purity and ternary alloys with tunable electrical properties. Because these molten materials are electrically conducting, external magnetic fields are often employed to regulate the flow in the melt. However, complicated by the coupled flow, thermal, electromagnetic and chemical physics, such magnetic control is typically empirical or even an educated guess. Two magnetic flow control mechanisms: flow damping by steady magnetic fields, and flow stirring by alternating magnetic fields, are investigated numerically. Magnetic damping during optically-heated float-zone crystal growth is modeled using a spectral collocation method. The Marangoni convection at the free melt-gas interface is suppressed by applying a steady magnetic field, measured by the Hartmann number Ha. Using normal mode linear stability analyses, suppression of detrimental flow instabilities is quantitatively determined in a range applicable to experiments (up to Ha = 300 for Pr = 0. 02, and up to Ha = 500 for Pr = 0. 001). The hydrodynamic flow instability for small Prandtl number P r float-zone is confirmed by energy analyses. Rotating magnetic field stirring during confined crystal growth in an ampoule is also modeled. Decoupled from the flow field at small magnetic Reynolds number, the electromagnetic field is solved in a finite element solver. At low <b>AC</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the force {{is only in the}} azimuthal direction but penetrates deep into the melt. In contrast, the magnetic shielding effect is observed at high alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>frequencies,</b> where the external magnetic field penetrates only by a skin depth into the electrically conducting media within the short AC cycle. As a result, the electromagnetic body force is primarily confined to the ampoule surface. At these high <b>AC</b> <b>frequencies</b> the magnetic flux lines are drastically distorted within the melt. The body force is fully three-dimensional and is much stronger than at low <b>AC</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but is confined to near the ampoule surface due to the magnetic shielding effect. These models promote fundamental understanding of flow dynamics regulated by electromagnetic body forces. They provide quantitative guidance for crystal growth to minimize trial and error experimentation that is slow and expensive...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a boundary-integral equation (BIE) method for {{the calculation of}} poloidal axisymmetric magnetic fields applicable {{in a wide range}} of <b>ac</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The method is based on the vector potential formulation and it uses the Green's functions of Laplace and Helmholtz equations for the exterior and interior of conductors, respectively. The work is particularly focused on a calculation of axisymmetric Green's function for the Helmholtz equation which is both simpler and more accurate compared to previous approaches. Three different approaches are used for calculation of the Green's function depending on the parameter range. For low and high dimensionless <b>ac</b> <b>frequencies</b> we use a power series expansion in terms of elliptical integrals and an asymptotic series in terms of modified Bessel functions of second kind, respectively. For the intermediate frequency range, Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto quadratures are used. The method is verified by comparing with the analytical solution for a sphere in a uniform external ac field. The application of the method is demonstrated for a composite model inductor containing an external secondary circuit. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
