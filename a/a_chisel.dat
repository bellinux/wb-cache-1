5|$|Vito Zani {{pointed out}} in 2012 that the face of San Faustino is unfinished; it has been brought {{to a level of}} {{definition}} close to the sanding surface. These parts were not ground flat, but worked with <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> directly, thereby ignoring the canonical technical process, and providing further evidence of the virtuosity of Gasparo Cairano in sculpting heads.|$|E
5|$|A {{folklore}} {{story is}} {{also associated with}} Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa's master carpenter {{in the construction of}} the keep. According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast. Eventually, he became distraught and climbed to the top of the keep, where he jumped to his death with <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> in his mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of <b>a</b> <b>chisel.</b> Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{attending the}} execution of this first order were such {{that they are not}} easily understood by present-day mechanics. Modern machine tools simply did not exist; the cylinders were bored by <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> fixed in a block of wood and turned by hand; the workmen had to be taught how to do nearly all the work; and Baldwin himself did a great deal of it with his own hands.|$|E

25|$|As the killer's epithet implies, {{the victims}} usually were {{attacked}} with an axe, which often {{belonged to the}} victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by <b>a</b> <b>chisel,</b> which were both left on the floor near the door, followed by an attack on {{one or more of}} the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.|$|E
25|$|Upon a papal death, {{the ring}} {{used to be}} ceremonially {{destroyed}} using a hammer {{in the presence of}} other Cardinals by the Camerlengo. This was done to prevent issuance of forged documents during the interregnum, or sede vacante. Today, the destruction of the ring's device with deep scratches is a symbol of the end of rule of the pope who used to wear that ring. This custom was followed after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI by applying two deep cuts, {{in the shape of a}} cross, on the signet with <b>a</b> <b>chisel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Petroglyphs are {{engravings}} or carvings {{into the}} rock panel. They are created {{with the use of}} a hard hammerstone, which is battered against the stone surface. In certain societies, the choice of hammerstone itself has religious significance. In other instances, the rock art is pecked out through indirect percussion, as a second rock is used like <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> between the hammerstone and the panel. A third, rarer form of engraving rock art was through incision, or scratching, into the surface of the stone with a lithic flake or metal blade. The motifs produced using this technique are fine-lined and often difficult to see.|$|E

25|$|Leopold (then 19 years old) and Loeb (18) {{settled on}} the {{kidnapping}} and murder {{of a young boy}} as their perfect crime. They spent seven months planning everything from the method of abduction to disposal of the body. To obfuscate the precise nature of their crime and their motive, they decided to make a ransom demand, and devised an intricate plan for collecting it, involving a long series of complex delivery instructions to be communicated, one set at a time, by phone. They typed the final set of instructions involving the actual money drop {{in the form of a}} ransom note, using the typewriter stolen from the fraternity house. <b>A</b> <b>chisel</b> was selected as the murder weapon, and purchased.|$|E
25|$|Ezekiel House left Owego in {{the spring}} of 1854 as he had taken a {{contract}} to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle of his right hand severed by <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated his doing any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an automatic gate.|$|E
25|$|Most finds {{appeared}} {{to be from the}} main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds {{may be the result of}} the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely <b>a</b> <b>chisel,</b> a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related Lohra tomb and collared bottles connected with the northern Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called Giant Urn belongs to the later burial.|$|E
5000|$|The term bench mark, or benchmark, {{originates}} {{from the}} chiseled horizontal marks that surveyors made in stone structures, into which an angle-iron {{could be placed}} to form a [...] "bench" [...] for a leveling rod, thus ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately repositioned {{in the same place}} in the future. These marks were usually indicated with <b>a</b> <b>chiseled</b> arrow below the horizontal line.|$|R

25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main {{function}} of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue {{at the top of}} the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to no-till and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the mouldboard plough.|$|E
25|$|Five {{types are}} shown in the {{illustration}} with a white background. In the top row, series A-E, {{the whole of the}} edges are rounded, except the bottom ones. In the next line (F-J) all are of <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> type. The tops and sides of these are sometimes flat or angular, and sometimes rounded; and the lower, or cutting edges, are sharp. The examples in the next series (K-O) bear some resemblance to a bill-hook; the top edges are flat; and they are all pierced with holes drilled from the two sides. The specimens in the next row have similar holes—otherwise they approximate to the chisel type; while the type represented in the bottom series U-Y differs from all the others in having projecting shoulders, and (occasionally) in having a groove {{along the length of the}} top edge, apparently to facilitate handling.|$|E
500|$|Francis Baily {{shortened}} {{this name}} to Caelum, {{as suggested by}} John Herschel.

500|$|A date between Gwen Cooper and {{her boyfriend}} Rhys Williams (Kai Owen) is cut short when they witness a meteor {{crashing}} outside Cardiff. Gwen receives a message on her mobile phone, and is called into action. As the Army secures the area, Torchwood investigate the meteor. Colleague Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) taunts Gwen by calling her the [...] "new girl". In an attempt to retaliate, she throws <b>a</b> <b>chisel</b> at him, but misses and cracks open the meteor, allowing a purple gas entity to escape. The gas finds a young woman, Carys Fletcher, outside a nightclub and takes her host. In the club, a possessed Carys seduces a man and takes him to a restroom, where they proceed to have sex. At the moment of climax however, the man dissolves into dust while Carys absorbs the energy that remains.|$|E
500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and rounded. The single, small dorsal fin is positioned far {{back on the}} body, about opposite the anal fin, and has a rounded margin. The pelvic and anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and also positioned well back on the body. The caudal fin is very long and roughly triangular, without a lower lobe or a ventral notch on the upper lobe. There are a pair of thick skin folds of unknown function running along the belly, separated by a groove. The midsection is relatively longer in females than in males, with the pelvic fins pushed closer to the anal fin. The dermal denticles are small and shaped like the tip of <b>a</b> <b>chisel,</b> becoming enlarged and sharp on the dorsal margin of the caudal fin. This species is a uniform dark brown or gray. The frilled shark differs from its southern African relative, C. africana, in having more vertebrae (160–171 vs 147) and more turns in the spiral valve intestine (35–49 versus 26–28), {{as well as in}} various proportional measurements such as a longer head and shorter gill slits. The maximum known length is [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E
500|$|The Tjele {{fragment}} {{was discovered}} amidst a 10th century collection of smith's tools in 1850, but its significance was not understood until 1984. Originally discovered by a farmer planting saplings by Tjele Manor, between Viborg and Randers, it {{was sent by}} the manor's owner to the National Museum of Denmark, where it remains today. In 1858 the collection of tools—two anvils, five hammers, three pairs of tongs, a pair of plate shears, two files, <b>a</b> <b>chisel,</b> two drawplates, two foundry ladles, a whetstone, a set of balance scales with ten weights, five sickles, a key, three iron nails, an axe, two jingles, a spearhead, bronze wires, fragments of bronze and iron, {{and the remains of}} a casket—was published, but the helmet fragment passed over as a saddle mounting. After leading [...] "an unnoticed existence" [...] for some 130 years despite being on display, the fragment was finally recognized as the remainder of a helmet by Elisabeth Munksgaard, the assistant keeper at the museum's Department of the Prehistory of Denmark. Publishing her realisation in 1984, she noted that [...] "the best finds are often made not in the field, but in the museums." ...|$|E
5000|$|Battle of the Centaurs {{was also}} the first {{sculpture}} for which Michelangelo eschewed the use of the bow drill. Finer details of the relief were probably achieved with the use of <b>a</b> toothed <b>chisel</b> called <b>a</b> gradina. The smooth figures of the foreground contrast strongly with the roughly-hewn background, created with <b>a</b> subbia <b>chisel.</b> <b>A</b> traditional sculptor's tool, the subbia produced punched marks that had never before been left as a final surface in a work completed to this degree. Georgia Illetschko insisted in 2004, these unfinished surfaces are [...] "a conscious compositional element.", and not {{due to a lack of}} time. According to Scigliano, it was an important development in the non finito sculpting technique.|$|R
