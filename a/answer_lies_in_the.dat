25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the investors {{do not have to}} invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take {{the rest of the year}} off investing.|$|E
60|$|But {{if that is}} so, {{you will}} ask, {{why is it that}} they have not made more {{impression}} upon the enemy's position? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strategical position of Italy, and it can be discussed without any technicalities. A child could understand it. The Alps form such a bar across the north that there are only two points where serious operations are possible. One is the Trentino Salient where Austria can always threaten and invade Italy. She lies in the mountains with the plains beneath her. She can always invade the plain, but the Italians cannot seriously invade the mountains, since the passes would only lead to other mountains beyond. Therefore their only possible policy is to hold the Austrians back. This they have most successfully done, and though the Austrians {{with the aid of a}} shattering heavy artillery have recently made some advance, it is perfectly certain that they can never really carry out any serious invasion. The Italians then have done all that could be done in this quarter. There remains the other front, the opening by the sea. Here the Italians had a chance to advance over a front of plain bounded by a river with hills beyond. They cleared the plain, they crossed the river, they fought a battle very like our own battle of the Aisne upon the slopes of the hills, taking 20,000 Austrian prisoners, and now they are faced by barbed wire, machine guns, cemented trenches, and every other device which has held them as it has held every one else. But remember what they have done for the common cause and be grateful for it. They have in a year occupied some forty Austrian divisions, and relieved our Russian allies to that very appreciable extent. They have killed or wounded a quarter of a million, taken 40,000, and drawn to themselves a large portion of the artillery. That is their record up to date. As to the future it is very easy to prophesy. They will continue to absorb large enemy armies. Neither side can advance far as matters stand. But if the Russians advance and Austria has to draw her men to the East, there will be a tiger spring for Trieste. If manhood can break the line, then I believe the Durandos will do it.|$|E

The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November.

5000|$|An {{inertial}} reference frame (or inertial frame in short) is a frame {{in which all the}} physical laws hold.

Here, [...] "rotating" [...] means [...] "rotating with respect to some inertial frame".

Finally, one may ask how an inertial frame can be found, and the <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Newton's laws, at least in Newtonian mechanics: the first law guarantees the existence of an inertial frame while the second and third law are used to examine whether a given reference frame is an inertial one or not.|$|E

50|$|One {{trend that}} was common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Overland Campaign was the {{tendency}} of the Union forces to attack in more narrow formations than the Confederate forces. Often, Union brigades advanced with half of their regiments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front line and half in a second line. <b>The</b> division would <b>in</b> turn have two of its brigades forward {{with one or two}} behind. This allowed many Union offensives to bring fresh units into their attacks, but it often prevented the Northerners from using their numbers for an overwhelming initial assault, as their units were committed piecemeal. The Confederate brigades often put all of their regiments on line, which occasionally allowed them to overlap a Union flank. Did these formations reflect evolving doctrinal ideas? Were they responses to the restrictive nature of the terrain? Did commanders choose these methods to improve their ability to control their units? Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> personalities, experiences, and abilities of the commanders on both sides.
