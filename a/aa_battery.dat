25|$|German {{air raids}} by Zeppelin {{airships}} and Gotha bombers on British cities during World War I had shown {{the need for}} strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in the 1920s it began raising five dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA). The last of these was 55th (Kent) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, with headquarters at Fort Clarence in Rochester. At first the brigade consisted only of 163rd (Kent) <b>AA</b> <b>Battery</b> based at Tunbridge Wells and in turn formed the only unit of 28 Air Defence Brigade. In 1935 it was joined by the independent 166th (City of Rochester) <b>AA</b> <b>Battery,</b> which had been converted from a coastal defence battery (of Kent Heavy Bde RA) in 1932.|$|E

5000|$|Often, a CR-V3 {{battery is}} a single cell based on a non-rechargeable lithium battery chemistry, with a nominal voltage of 3 V (the same as 2 {{alkaline}} <b>AA</b> <b>batteries).</b> Because both lithium and lithium-ion chemistries offer higher energy density than NiMH rechargeable batteries or even alkaline batteries, a CR-V3 battery is designed to last much longer than a pair of <b>AA</b> <b>batteries.</b> [...] Some more recent CR-V3 batteries are composed of 2 lithium <b>AA</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R

25|$|On July 25, 2006, Apple {{released}} a wireless Mighty Mouse (part numbers MA272LL/A and MB111LL/A) which uses Bluetooth 2.0. The new version uses two AA batteries, but can {{run on a}} single <b>AA</b> <b>battery</b> to reduce weight. Wireless Mighty Mouse was priced at $69.|$|E
25|$|A second substance, {{a type of}} high {{explosive}}, {{would be}} hidden within an <b>AA</b> <b>battery</b> casing; this small explosive charge would detonate the main bomb. The charge would be detonated by linking the bottle of explosives to a light bulb and a disposable camera. The charge from the camera's flash unit would trigger the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Timor {{came under}} attack from Japanese {{aircraft}} on 26 January. The bombing, hampered by AA guns and a squadron of US Army Air Forces fighters based in Darwin, intensified during February. Air attacks forced an Allied convoy—escorted by the destroyers HMAS Swan and HMAS Warrego—to return to Australia. It had included valuable reinforcements, such as a US Army artillery battalion and {{the remainder of the}} British <b>AA</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} at the Rad Lab was {{the development of a}} mobile microwave gun- laying (aiming) radar for use with anti-aircraft (AA) guns. In May 1941, the preliminary system was completed and a demonstration was given to now Brig. General Roger B. Colton, Chief of Research and Engineering at the SCL. He promised Army support for the final development and recommended procuring a set for every <b>AA</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Home Counties (Kent) Heavy Battery was reconstituted as 205 (Chatham and Faversham) Medium Battery at Sittingbourne, {{later at}} the Drill Hall, Chatham. It formed part of 13th (Kent) Medium Brigade (formerly 4th Home Counties Brigade, Royal Field Artillery). This unit was soon redesignated 52nd (Kent) Medium Brigade, and in 1935 became 58th (Kent) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. The {{following}} year, 205 (Kent) <b>AA</b> <b>Battery</b> was transferred to 55th (Kent) AA Brigade (see above).|$|E
25|$|Capacitors may {{retain a}} charge long after power {{is removed from}} a circuit; this charge can cause {{dangerous}} or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt <b>AA</b> <b>battery,</b> has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up from static charges or passing weather events.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of France {{had already}} begun when 37 S/L Regiment began embarking. Regimental HQ and a {{composite}} battery comprising one troop from each battery embarked at Dover on 15 May 1940 and landed at Dunkirk the next day. They were followed by 307 Battery, {{but the rest of}} the regiment was halted on the road to Dover and returned to Aldershot. The Composite Battery and 307 Battery eventually joined RHQ, driving through streams of refugees, but because of the rapid advance of the Germans, they were withdrawn to take up positions protecting Le Havre (307 Bty with 24 lights) and Harfleur (Composite Bty with 13 lights), while the main BEF was being evacuated from Dunkirk. On 9 June RHQ and Composite Bty moved again to St Malo, where 37 S/L RHQ took command of the heavy and light AA guns of 23 <b>AA</b> <b>Battery,</b> RA, and was joined by one troop of 307 Bty from the south side of the River Seine.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most of Britain's defence forces, 3 AA Division was {{frequently}} in action during the so-called Phoney War that lasted from September 1939 to May 1940. The first action occurred unexpectedly on 16 October 1939, when nine enemy aircraft suddenly {{appeared out of}} cloud and dived on warships off Rosyth Dockyard, close to the Forth Bridge. No warning had been given, but gun positions of 71 HAA Rgt hastily loaded for a 'crash' action under individual gun control, normal prediction being impossible against diving and turning targets. A total of 104 rounds were fired and one aircraft had its tail shot off (fighters accounted for another two). HMS Southampton was damaged. The following day, 14 hostile aircraft in three waves attacked warships lying in Scapa Flow. The Chain Home early-warning radar system did not yet cover Scapa, but 226 Bty of 101 HAA Rgt was able to engage and claimed one shot down. Among the vessels damaged in this raid was the Jutland veteran HMS Iron Duke, acting as a base ship and floating <b>AA</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
500|$|Massachusettss {{main battery}} {{consisted}} of nine /45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three triple turrets (two superfiring turrets forward, the third turret mounted aft {{of the main}} superstructure) that were capable of firing [...] armor-piercing (AP) Mark 8 shells. Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 5"/38 caliber guns, which could hit targets up to [...] away. For defense against air strikes, Massachusetts was fitted with an anti-aircraft (<b>AA)</b> <b>battery</b> of 0.50cal machine guns and 1.1"/75 caliber guns. With a wholesale shift to air power {{at the dawn of}} World War II came the imperative to gain and maintain air superiority {{in order to protect the}} growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers. [...] By the end of the war Massachusetts sported an array of Oerlikon 20mm and quadruple Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

500|$|Sunday, 7 December 1941, {{found the}} {{battleship}} at Casco Bay, Maine, undergoing a rest and relaxation period following {{three months of}} watch duty at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near Iceland until March when she returned home. Around this time, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light <b>AA</b> <b>battery</b> was greatly increased, with the two 1.1-inch/75 caliber quad mount guns replaced by 6 (later 10) quad mount [...] Bofors and 44 [...] Oerlikon cannons, the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this. For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted Guadalcanal-bound marines as far as Panama; on another, the warship screened service troops to Freetown, Sierra Leone, {{on the west coast}} of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.|$|E

[...] The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single <b>AA</b> <b>battery,</b> with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours. Also included in the handheld was built-in memory allowing players to save their game.
