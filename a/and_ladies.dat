5|$|In their heraldic achievements, {{members of}} the Order of the Garter may {{encircle}} their escutcheon with the Garter. Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, a privilege granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, {{and others have been}} granted them as a special reward, only {{members of the}} Royal Family, peers, Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> Companion of the Garter, Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.|$|E

5|$|Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> of the Thistle {{may also}} be {{admitted}} to the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights elevated to the senior Order would resign from the Order of the Thistle. The first to resign from the Order of the Thistle was John, Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas, Earl of Zetland in 1872. Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> of the Thistle {{may also be}} deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a fate was John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715.|$|E

The reception afterwards at the Royal Palace Hotel included nearly 140 guests, including Sir William <b>and</b> <b>Lady</b> McKercher, Sir Alexander <b>and</b> <b>Lady</b> Murray, the Honourable Maurice Baring, Sir Thomas <b>and</b> <b>Lady</b> Catto, Sir Thomas <b>and</b> <b>Lady</b> Neave.|$|R
5|$|Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the circlet (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and {{the collar of}} the Order; the former is shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, <b>and</b> <b>ladies</b> in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century, the Sovereign {{made his}} or her choices {{on the advice of}} the Government. In 1946, with the {{agreement}} of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again. Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the advice of His or Her Government.|$|E

5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|The Garter is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} household was staffed {{almost entirely}} by eunuchs <b>and</b> <b>ladies</b> with their own bureaus. Female servants were organized into the Bureau of Palace Attendance, Bureau of Ceremonies, Bureau of Apparel, Bureau of Foodstuffs, Bureau of the Bedchamber, Bureau of Handicrafts, and Office of Staff Surveillance. Starting in the 1420s, eunuchs began taking over these ladies' positions until only the Bureau of Apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained. Hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the Directorate of Palace Attendants, but as eunuch power at court increased, so did their administrative offices, with eventual twelve directorates, four offices, and eight bureaus. The dynasty had a vast imperial household, staffed with thousands of eunuchs, who were headed by the Directorate of Palace Attendants. The eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance, ceremonial rites, food, utensils, documents, stables, seals, apparel, and so on. The offices {{were in charge of}} providing fuel, music, paper, and baths. The bureaus were in charge of weapons, silverwork, laundering, headgear, bronzework, textile manufacture, wineries, and gardens. At times, the most influential eunuch in the Directorate of Ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights <b>and</b> <b>Ladies</b> end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E
5|$|At the {{investiture}} ceremony the Admonitions {{are read}} in turn by the prelate and {{chancellor of the}} order and several insignia are offered on a cushion to the Sovereign by Garter King of Arms, Black Rod, {{and the secretary of}} the order, in turn, so that the Sovereign may perform the ceremony of investiture. Two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting the Sovereign in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar. After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights <b>and</b> <b>ladies</b> of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 17th century, {{the play was}} famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a {{procession}} of mad courtiers <b>and</b> <b>ladies</b> in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances. By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented {{a fundamental change in}} literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot. By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued Hamlet for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.|$|E
