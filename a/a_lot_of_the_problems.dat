500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I think that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> we deal with today {{in the world are}} the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

Anderson {{was moved to the}} SRU to help with Elite Development. At the time Telfer noted that Searancke's appointment at Glasgow was a mistake. However in his autobiography 'Looking back... for once' he states that he regretted the sacking as Searancke identified limitations in terms of the players' standards and their ability to push themselves to the levels required to be consistently competitive.

'Father Knows Best' purported to be a reasonable facsimile of life. And the bad thing is, the model is so deceitful. It usually revolved around not wanting to tell the truth, either out of embarrassment, or not wanting to hurt someone.

To her the most disturbing study was about umbilical cord blood (2009), which [...] "found up to 232 man-made industrial compounds and pollutants present in a child before it is even born. Ten out of ten babies were shown to have chlorinated dioxins in their blood". Other influential studies and interviews include Dr. Ana Soto (who has researched Bisphenol A in plastic) who [...] "explained that toxic chemicals are afforded the same rights as human beings: innocent until proven guilty", and Paul Jepson's work at ZSL about the effect of toxic chemicals on cetaceans in the world's seas and oceans for 20 years, finding out that the killer whales are no longer able to reproduce as they carry the biggest toxic burden.|$|E

Craig cites some of his early idols as Boyz II Men and New Found Glory. He was put into the school choir as a default elective but was ultimately kicked out. As a child, {{he says that he}} [...] "had a hard time keeping out of trouble" [...] and that [...] "high school wasn't for him."

50|$|In May 2004 it was {{discovered}} that the school had problems with its working environment and staffing. They had to use one of the school's bus drivers as a teacher of mathematics, Norwegian and gymnastics when the regular teachers were on sick leave due to conflicts at the school. The parents reported the conditions to the government. The government discovered that several of the teachers lacked formal education beyond high school, that none of them were qualified as teachers, and that the teachers were employed by the church and not by the school. The leaders of the school refuted a lot of the criticism from the parents but admitted that the bus driver had been an assistant for the 7 to 9 year olds. They promised to rectify the problems. The school authorities ordered them to rectify <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> and warned the school that they could lose their government grant. The working conditions were also controlled by the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority and they were instructed to have procedures for conflict resolution, for clarifying the school's religious education, for employee attendance at prayer meetings, and to show the separation between the school and the church. They also charged the school with provisions to prevent harassment of employees and to establish plans to meet legal requirements when employees were on sick leave.|$|E

5000|$|Where as {{previous}} Thrice albums have lyrically {{focused on}} literary, biblical and occasional science-fiction themes, To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere touches on various political, {{cultural and social}} themes {{for most of the}} album. Generally speaking about the album's lyrics, Kensrue said, [...] "I would definitely say that we've drawn a lot of our influence from the current state of politics, but I also like to personalize things when I write, and I've always written that way." [...] The song [...] "Blood On the Sand" [...] (with the opening line: [...] "We wave our flags, we swallow fear like medicine / We kiss the hands of profiteers and their congressmen") was described as having [...] "much more hard-hitting political dialogue" [...] and Kensrue elaborated in another interview that, [...] "I've usually tried to stay out of being explicitly political in the sense of being partisan, at least in my art. I really hate the party system and think it's a huge part of <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> we have ... I try not to go to the party lines but to just talk about actual social issues that have political ramifications." [...] The song [...] "Black Honey" [...] conjures imagery of a man swatting at bees in order to collect their honey while becoming confused why they would sting him back, which Kensrue said [...] "seemed a fitting metaphor for much of U.S. foreign policy." [...] The song [...] "Whistleblower" [...] is about Edward Snowden, who famously leaked NSA documents proving that the government was spying on American citizens without warrant. The song [...] "Death from Above" [...] was written from the perspective of an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (or drone) pilot. Kensrue said about half the tracks on To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere follow this explicitly political theme, while the rest were described as being more broadly focused and touched on social or cultural concepts.|$|E
5000|$|The Xbox {{version was}} {{described}} as [...] "truly fantastic" [...] by the Official Xbox Magazine, who scored it 9 out of 10. IGN were also impressed, scoring it 8.8 out of 10 and calling it [...] "the best Star Wars experience on the Xbox". Reviewer Aaron Boudling praised how the controls had been mapped onto the Xbox Controller, but was {{highly critical of the}} game's lack of support for Xbox Live, and the absence of an online multiplayer mode. He also felt the graphics in the cutscenes were significantly weaker than the PC version. GameSpot scored it 8.3 out of 10, with reviewer Amer Ajami saying the port [...] "retains the essence of what it must feel like to be an all-powerful Jedi, which was so well conveyed in the original PC game, without sacrificing {{much in the way of}} graphics, playability, or overall value. In fact, the game's complicated control scheme is better served on an Xbox controller than it is in the PC's typical mouse and keyboard setup." [...] However, he too criticized the lack of Xbox Live support and the poor graphical quality of the cutscenes. Game Revolution gave the game a B+, praising the controls and atmosphere, but criticizing the AI and lack of Xbox Live support. Eurogamer were as unimpressed with the Xbox version as they had been with the PC version, scoring it 6 out of 10. Reviewer Kristan Reed found <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> with the game to be inherent to the original, not problems with the port - a slow beginning, poor AI, bad level design, repetitive puzzles. Reed called the lack of Xbox Live support [...] "plain unacceptable" [...] and concluded [...] "Jedi Outcast is certainly an entertaining package when it gets things right, but it's also riddled with design flaws, technical flaws and various minor irritations that conspire to detract from your overall enjoyment. Given that it's also not Live (or even LAN) enabled, Xbox owners don't even have that crumb of comfort to elevate its status." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{philosophy}} of mind. The main theme for this project {{is the concept of}} intentionality found in Edmund Husserls Logical Investigations. To frame intentionality in a context as regards the history of philosophy, the first part deals with Descartes and Locke and their versions of a representational theory of mind. The various points of criticism of these theories lead toward the concept of intentionality that, even though it solves <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of Cartesianism, leave many questions about the mind’s relation to an outside world unresolved. These issues are investigated in the light of more recent philosophers of mind, Tim Crane and Gregory McCulloch, who in turn represent different solutions.

40|$|We answer an {{implicit}} question of Ian Hodkinson's. We show that atomic Pinters algebras {{may not be}} completely representable, however the class of completely representable Pinters algebras is elementary and finitely axiomatizable. We obtain analagous results for infinite dimensions (replacing finite axiomatizability by finite schema axiomatizability). We show that the class of subdirect products of set algebras is a canonical variety that is locally finite only for finite dimensions, and has the superamalgamation property; the latter for all dimensions. However, the algebras we deal with are expansions of Pinter algebras with substitutions corresponding to tranpositions. It is true that this makes the <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> addressed harder, {{but this is an}} acet, not a liability. Futhermore, the results for Pinter's algebras readily follow by just discarding the substitution operations corresponding to transpostions.

The starting points of the new discipline followed the principles of ‘women's health care'. These principles can be summarized as the emphasis on control and autonomy by the patient, demedicalization, the importance of the psychosocial context of complaints, empowerment of women and good information and communication.
