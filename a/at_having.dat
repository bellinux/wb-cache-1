50|$|Conservation {{efforts in}} the state are {{hampered}} by high marginalization, lack of economic alternatives, agricultural conflicts, change of land use (agricultural activities, fires), over exploitation and pollution of natural water sources, inadequate forest management and illegal tree felling, unsustainable coastal tourist developments, climate change, limited local capacity, and limited local knowledge and valuation of natural resources.

5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed <b>at</b> <b>having</b> fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived {{too late for the}} battle. They were upset <b>at</b> <b>having</b> missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

In the letters covering her return journey, she describes the sublime scenery through which she travels, particularly the Simplon Pass and waterfalls in Switzerland.|$|E

As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} <b>at</b> <b>having</b> her needs and desires {{take a back seat}} to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other.

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse <b>at</b> <b>having</b> to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed <b>at</b> <b>having</b> his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.|$|E
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed <b>at</b> <b>having</b> lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E

5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated <b>at</b> <b>having</b> to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism <b>at</b> <b>having</b> the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|Loyal to {{the concept}} of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged {{strengthening}} it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions {{in a wide range of}} areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered <b>at</b> <b>having</b> almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.|$|E
