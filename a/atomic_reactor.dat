The shielding on the airliner's <b>atomic</b> <b>reactor</b> is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will die of radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E

500|$|... "Trapped in the Sky" [...] is {{the first}} episode of Thunderbirds, a British 1960s Supermarionation {{television}} series. Written by co-creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, it was first broadcast on ATV Midlands on 30 September 1965. The plot revolves around criminal mastermind the Hood, who sabotages the nuclear-powered airliner Fireflash prior to her maiden flight. Unable to land for fear of detonating a motion-sensitive bomb, and threatened by radiation leaking from Fireflashs overworked <b>atomic</b> <b>reactor,</b> the crew and passengers' only hope of survival is the newly formed International Rescue Organisation.|$|E
500|$|During the Manhattan Project, Wigner led a {{team that}} {{included}} Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's task was to design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium. [...] At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. Wigner was present at a converted rackets court under the stands at the University of Chicago's abandoned Stagg Field on December 2, 1942, when the world's first <b>atomic</b> <b>reactor,</b> Chicago Pile One (CP-1) achieved a controlled nuclear chain reaction.|$|E
500|$|Churchill sought {{information}} about building Britain's own gaseous diffusion plant, a heavy water plant and an <b>atomic</b> <b>reactor</b> in Britain, despite its immense cost. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce [...] of weapons-grade uranium per day {{was estimated to}} cost up to £3 million in research and development, and anything up to £50 million to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce [...] of plutonium per diem {{would have to be}} built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost £5 million. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water for the reactor costing between £5 million and £10 million, and for producing uranium metal £1.5 million. The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require 20,000 workers, many of them highly skilled, [...] of steel, and 500 MW of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to secure American co-operation.|$|E

Cemal Gürsel granted a presidential pardon for the life sentences of the previous president Celal Bayar and the former chief of general staff Rustu Erdelhun whose prior execution sentence was also revoked by the National Unity Committee upon Gürsel's appeals. He initiated the new era of planned economy in Turkey, formed a State Institute of Statistics, launched the State Planning Organization (DPT) that implemented [...] "The First 5-Years Development Plan", arranged re-entry of the Turkish Republic in the United Nations Security Council in 1961 and moved Turkey, through his close and personal diplomatic dialogues with Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, into the direction of European Union membership with the Ankara Agreement, signed with France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg in 1963, resulting in associate membership the following year and a large Turkish workforce migration to Germany and Western Europe to assist their postwar industrial development.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the regular}} {{fighting}} on the show, Batman and Robin typically use non-lethal force; only three criminal characters die during the series: the Riddler's moll Molly (played by Jill St. John in the pilot episode), who accidentally falls into the Batcave's <b>atomic</b> <b>reactor,</b> and two out-of-town gunmen who shoot at Batman and Robin, but kill each other instead, {{toward the end of}} [...] "Zelda The Great/A Death Worse Than Fate". [...] In the film, six criminals die in total: Five henchmen are dehydrated by the Penguin in order to infiltrate the Batcave, but this plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck. A sixth henchman is presumably killed when he is caught in a trap meant for Batman and sprung into an exploding octopus. Twice, the Catwoman (Julie Newmar) appears to fall to her death (into a bottomless pit and from a high building into a river), but returned in later episodes. In [...] "Instant Freeze", Mr. Freeze freezes a butler solid and knocks him over, and sound-effects suggest that he is shattered into pieces. A later reference suggests the butler survived. In [...] "Green Ice", Mr. Freeze freezes a policeman solid; it is left unclear whether he survived.
