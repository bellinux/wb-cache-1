40|$|Abstract: The {{vertical}} distribution and diet of the myctophid species Steno-brachius nannochir were examined on samples collected at various mesopelagic depths (> 600 m) {{day and night}} in the southern Bering Sea, in June and July 1987. This species exhibited no diel variation in {{vertical distribution}}, remaining {{at a depth of}} about 600 m. Stomachs were examined from 226 specimens. The diet was dominated by copepoda, mostly Calanus plumchrus, Calanus cristatus, Euca-lanus bungii bungii and Metridia pacifica. The stomach fullness and prey digestive stage indicated little evidence of feeding periodicity, suggesting that S. nannochir is an acyclic predator among the family Myctophidae. The <b>acyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> by this non-migrating myctophid appears to adapt it to exploit efficiently the broad vertical distribution and abundance of prey in the subarctic Pacific Ocean. 1...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{the degree}} of filling and the state of {{digestion}} of four species (Diaphus watasei, Benthosema fibulatum, Myctophum brachygnatum and Diaphus garmani) revealed that all but D. watasei were cyclic feeders feeding at or near the surface during the night. Diaphus watasei was an <b>acyclic</b> feeder <b>feeding</b> close to the bottom. Prey analysis of 14 myctophid species showed that crustacea, mainly copepods, was the main food. Molluscs and bivalve larvae, larvaceans and salps, chaetognaths and polychaetes were also eaten. For Diaphus watasei, euphasiids, squids (family Onychoteuthidae), fish and fish larvae (family Myctophidae), contributed a great deal. All but three species were opportunistic feeders. Diaphus nielseni, Diaphus jenseni (both feeding specifically on copepods) and Myctophum brachygriatum (feeding specifically on molluscs and bivalve larvae) were selective feeders. The myctophids showed food partitioning by feeding at different depths, on selected sizes and selected taxa. Ontogenetical resource partitioning was also observed. They were visually oriented predators and the maximum prey size seemed to be determined {{by the size of the}} jaw. They seemed to catch individual prey items and swallow them whole...|$|R
40|$|Viridicatumtoxin (1) is a tetracycline-like fungal meroterpenoid with a unique, fused spirobicyclic ring system. Puzzlingly, no {{dedicated}} terpene cyclase {{is found}} in the gene cluster identified in Penicillium aethiopicum. Cytochrome P 450 enzymes VrtE and VrtK in the vrt gene cluster were shown to catalyze C 5 -hydroxylation and spirobicyclic ring formation, respectively. <b>Feeding</b> <b>acyclic</b> previridicatumtoxin to Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing VrtK confirmed that VrtK is the sole enzyme required for cyclizing the geranyl moiety. Thus, VrtK is the first example of a P 450 that can catalyze terpene cyclization, most likely via initial oxidation of C 17 to an allylic carbocation. Quantum chemical modeling revealed a possible new tertiary carbocation intermediate E that forms after allylic carbocation formation. Intermediate E can readily undergo concerted 1, 2 -alkyl shift/ 1, 3 -hydride shift, either spontaneously or further aided by VrtK, followed by C 7 Friedel-Crafts alkylation to afford 1. The most likely stereochemical course of the reaction was proposed {{on the basis of the}} results of our computations. 1 DP 1 GM 106413 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 1 R 01 GM 085128 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesDP 1 GM 106413 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesGM- 0846 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 GM 085128 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesT 32 GM 008496 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 11 - 13 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24161266 PMC 387205...|$|R
