5|$|The {{practice}} of training barristers at the Inns of Chancery had died out by 1642, and the Inns instead became dedicated <b>associations</b> <b>and</b> offices for solicitors.

5|$|Along {{with the}} general {{administration}} of the sport, football <b>associations</b> <b>and</b> competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E
5|$|Although breed <b>associations</b> <b>and</b> the French National Stud {{are making}} {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these {{organizations}} consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of chemicals {{present in the}} island's soil, together with resolutions passed by Guam's legislature, suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases Anderson Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected {{an enormous amount of}} evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness <b>associations</b> <b>and</b> disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{lays the}} {{juridical}} foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious <b>associations,</b> <b>and</b> non-confessional and philosophical organisations.

In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.|$|E
5|$|Both {{real and}} fictitious plants play {{a wide variety}} of roles in {{literature}} and film. Plants' roles may be evil, as with the triffids, carnivorous plants with a whip-like poisonous sting as well as mobility provided by three foot-like appendages, from John Wyndham's 1951 science fiction novel The Day of the Triffids, and subsequent films and radio plays. J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth makes use of many named kinds of plant, including the healing herb athelas the yellow star-flower elanor which grows in special places such as Cerin Amroth in Lothlórien, and the tall mallorn tree of the elves. Tolkien names several individual trees of significance in the narrative, including the Party Tree in the Shire with its happy <b>associations,</b> <b>and</b> the malevolent Old Man Willow in the Old Forest.|$|E

5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these <b>associations,</b> <b>and</b> later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration.

5|$|Despite {{these attacks}} and {{those from the}} extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established.

In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition.
