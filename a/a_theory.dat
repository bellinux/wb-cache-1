5|$|M-theory is <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> {{in physics}} that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory. The {{existence of such}} <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California {{in the spring of}} 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>theory</b> of strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} supersymmetry is called a superstring theory. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>theory</b> was {{put forward}} by the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, who {{suggested}} that Prester John might be found among the kings of Georgia, which, {{at the time of}} Crusades, experienced military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke.|$|E

5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> of climate change based {{on the presence of}} petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo.|$|E

40|$|Naturalistic teleological {{accounts}} of mental content rely on <b>an</b> etiological <b>theory</b> of function. Nanay has raised a new objection to <b>an</b> etiological <b>theory,</b> and proposed <b>an</b> alternative <b>theory</b> of function that attributes modal force to claims about function. The {{aim of this}} paper is both to defend and to cast a new light on <b>an</b> etiological <b>theory</b> of function. I argue against Nanay’s “trait type individuation objection,” suggesting that <b>an</b> etiological <b>theory</b> also attributes modal force to claims about function. An etiological theory of function can be thought to analyze claims about function with modal force, not relying on any theory of counterfactuals...|$|R

5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
40|$|Mephisto is a {{framework}} that will enable ontologybased high-level information fusion. Within the framework, the name Mephisto {{can be used to}} refer to a conceptualisation, an ontology, an agent, a society, <b>a</b> formal <b>theory,</b> and <b>an</b> implementation. A Mephisto conceptualisation assumes that the world can be understood in terms of processes. A Mephisto ontology is a specification of the conceptualisation. A Mephisto agent employs the ontology. <b>A</b> Mephisto <b>theory</b> is <b>a</b> formal <b>theory</b> of processes. <b>A</b> Mephisto implementation implements the <b>theory.</b> <b>A</b> Mephisto <b>theory</b> plays <b>a</b> crucial role within the framework...|$|R

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>theory</b> of knowledge, {{epistemology}} {{differs from}} ontology, {{which is a}} subbranch of metaphysics, theory of reality.

5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of <b>a</b> <b>theory,</b> less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
