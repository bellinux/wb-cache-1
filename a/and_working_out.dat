5|$|In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau {{to direct}} Iron Man, with Arthur Marcum & Matt Holloway, and Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby writing {{competing}} scripts. Favreau consolidated both into one script, {{which was then}} polished by John August. Robert Downey, Jr. was cast {{in the title role}} in September 2006, after growing out a goatee <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part. Principal photography began on March 12, 2007, with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan, which was filmed in Inyo County, California. Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008, and was released internationally on April 30, and in North America on May 2.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Nash began {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} the national media and professional scouts. He had spent the summer before that honing his skills, playing with the Canadian national team <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> with the likes of established NBA players Jason Kidd and Gary Payton. Santa Clara again captured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named Conference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to do so since Kurt Rambis. He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first round upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland, but then the Broncos were eliminated by Kansas. Nash's performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention All-America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA. He also finished his career as Santa Clara's all-time leader in career assists (510), free-throw percentage (.862), and made and attempted three-pointers (263–656). He remains third on the school's all-time scoring list (1,689), and holds Santa Clara's single-season free-throw percentage record (.894). In September 2006, Nash had his jersey (#11) retired, becoming the first Santa Clara student-athlete to receive that honour.|$|E

25|$|From 2002 to 2003, Bale {{starred in}} three feature films, such as Laurel Canyon (2002), which was {{generally}} well received by critics. This film marked {{the second time}} he worked with actress Kate Beckinsale, his co-star in Prince of Jutland (1994). Critics generally focused on star Frances McDormand's performance over the rest of the cast, however. The post-apocalyptic action fantasy film Reign of Fire was Bale's first action vehicle, and had compared to all his previous work, an immense budget estimated at US$95,000,000. Bale entered into negotiations about starring in the film with reservations, but director Rob Bowman convinced him to take the lead role. Bale played Quinn Abercromby with Matthew McConaughey's Denton Van Zan. They trained for their respective roles by boxing <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Lisch re-signed {{with the}} Wildcats for the 2010–11 NBL season. Lisch gladly put pen to paper after contemplating {{a move to}} Europe and being on the radar of several other NBL clubs. He came into the 2010–11 season {{sporting}} a more muscular tone, having bulked up for his second season after spending countless hours running <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> in the weights room. Lisch scored in double figures in all but nine games during the regular season, as he scored over 20 points three times. The Wildcats were hit by numerous long-term injuries during the 2010–11 season that derailed their chances at defending their title. They finished the regular season in fourth place with a 16–12 record, and faced the first-placed New Zealand Breakers in the Semi Finals. Behind a 29-point effort, Lisch helped the Wildcats take Game 1 of the series in Auckland, before the Breakers came back to win Games 2 and 3. Lisch appeared in all 31 games for the Wildcats in 2010–11, averaging 13.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. His strong season saw him share the Gordon Ellis Medal as the Perth Wildcats' MVP along with co-captain Shawn Redhage.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals {{began their}} 2017 season {{at home against}} the {{division}} rival Miami Marlins. Marlins starter Edinson Vólquez pitched effectively, making heavy use of his changeup to bamboozle Nationals hitters <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> of jams {{in the first and}} fourth innings. He gave up four hits and a walk and allowed no runs while striking out six, but he left the game after five innings. Stephen Strasburg was efficient as the Opening Day starter for the Nationals, but the Marlins took the lead {{in the top of the}} fourth inning, with right fielder Giancarlo Stanton driving in catcher J.T. Realmuto with a double and then scoring on a single by Marcell Ozuna. The lead was cut in half as Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper hit his fifth career Opening Day home run to right field off Marlins reliever David Phelps in the sixth inning with no one on base, and then Phelps gave up the lead entirely in the bottom of the seventh inning, as pinch-hitter Adam Lind homered to center field after a two-out single by catcher Matt Wieters—both players new additions to the Nationals who signed late in the off-season, with Lind making his first plate appearance with Washington.|$|E

After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> their differences hindered the writing process initially.

500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{disliked the}} focus the episode {{placed on the}} adult characters, with many objecting to Will's characterisation. VanDerWerff wrote that his storyline with Emma [...] "misplac what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place", and IGN's Robert Canning—who otherwise enjoyed the episode, and rated it 8.5/10—observed that Will was presented as being selfish and a [...] "terrible educator", in contrast to his former role as the moral centre of the show. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post initially found {{the focus on the}} adults a welcome change, but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed, and deemed it overall, [...] "Creepy, vaguely uncomfortable, in slightly poor taste but well-intentioned, and ultimately, thoroughly entertaining to watch for reasons I can't quite put into words." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma, as well as Finn and his body image issues. While Stack commended the male body image storyline, and found it refreshing for a program to examine the objectification of men, de Moraes derided it, and likened Finn and Sam's discussion about eating healthily <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> to an [...] "after school special".|$|E

500|$|Trueblood was {{a native}} of Salem, Indiana. He {{attended}} Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana and received an A.M. degree. In 1878, Trueblood and Robert I. Fulton established the Fulton and Trueblood School of Oratory in Kansas City, Missouri, which became [...] "one of the largest and best known institutions {{of its kind in the}} United States." [...] In 1884, Trueblood came to Ann Arbor as a lecturer on public speaking, intending to give a six-week course. The next year he was invited back. At the time he also was lecturing at Missouri, Kentucky and Ohio Wesleyan, <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> of Fulton and Trueblood School. Michigan asked him to join the faculty, and he stayed for 67 years. In 1892, he founded the Department of Elocution and Oratory and became its first chairman. Michigan's Oratory and Elocution Department was the first such unit in any major university or college in the country. He also established the first credit course in speech at any American university. At the turn of the century, speech and oratory played an important role in American society and academia, so much so that Trueblood was the highest paid professor on the University of Michigan faculty, and students were required to take Trueblood's courses.|$|E
500|$|Miyamoto {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to work with}} Itoi {{at a time when}} companies were pushing major celebrity product endorsements, as Itoi's involvement would be for such a game. When the two met next, Miyamoto brought the documentation from a text adventure game and told Itoi {{that he would have to}} write similar documentation himself. Miyamoto said that he knew from his own experience that the game would only be as good as the effort Itoi invested, and that he knew Itoi could not invest the appropriate time with his full-time job. Itoi restated his interest and reduced his workload, so Miyamoto assembled a development team. Upon assessing for compatibility, they began production in Ichikawa, Chiba. Itoi had said earlier that he wanted his work environment to feel like an extracurricular club consisting of volunteers <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> of an apartment, which Miyamoto tried to accommodate. Itoi wrote the game's script and commuted from Tokyo, a process he found [...] "exhausting". Even with asking Itoi to prioritize the development process, Miyamoto received criticism of acquiescing to celebrity and of hiring a copywriter not up for the task. Miyamoto said that his decision to pursue the project was based on his confidence in Itoi. Mother was released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan).|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the plot}} {{elements}} of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. These elements include paintings coming to life (Ages Ago, used again in Ruddigore), a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a [...] "pirate" [...] instead of to a [...] "pilot" [...] by mistake (Our Island Home, 1870, reused in The Pirates of Penzance), and the forceful mature lady who is [...] "an acquired taste" [...] (Eyes and No Eyes, 1875, reused in The Mikado). During this time, Gilbert perfected the 'topsy-turvy' style {{that he had been}} developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> its logical consequences, however absurd. Mike Leigh describes the [...] "Gilbertian" [...] style as follows: [...] "With great fluidity and freedom, [...] continually challenges our natural expectations. First, {{within the framework of the}} story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head. Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so on, and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way." ...|$|E

500|$|Whitney Balliett {{stated that}} Flanagan {{was the most}} {{consistent}} of the pianists influenced by Wilson, Tatum and Cole, and invariably created something new in his playing: he [...] "often states the melody with dissonant, levering chords played offbeat or staccato. Never decorative, they [...] reveal both a respect for the melody and an intense desire to alter it"; during his main improvising, he used [...] "interval-filled descending figures [...] charging rhythmic phrases whose accented first notes make the succeeding notes snap, double-time phrases that race ahead to clear the way, and legato phrases that form sauntering rear guards." [...] In a review of a 1989 concert, Feather commented that Flanagan used [...] "subtle dynamic shadings", while [...] "bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills" [...] and occasional musical quotes that added humor. Other techniques he employed were, in Stanley Crouch's description, [...] "crooning effects achieved by manipulating the pedals, holding down keys long enough to sustain notes in decisively different ways, <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> inflections that evoke the voice – sighs, moans, swells, purrs". Critic John S. Wilson described Flanagan's solo piano style on ballads in 1978: [...] "He drifts through ballads with a dreamy langourous flow, {{but it is not}} a soft or flabby style. There is, beneath the surface, a vitality that gives it a lean, swinging character".|$|E
