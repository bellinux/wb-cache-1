40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{analysis}} of Hutchinson and Neale is used for wrinkling prediction. Under a number of <b>assumptions,</b> <b>limitations</b> and simplifications a wrinkling criterion with some restrictive applicability, is obtained. Unfortunately, Hutchinson analysis is limited to regions of the sheet that are free of any contact. When contact is taken into account the problem is further complicated. Consequently, a local indicator based on the change of curvatures under compressive stresses is developed. Both wrinkling indicators are used to drive the adaptive mesh refinement {{in order to be}} able to accurately spot wrinkling. The numerical results will be compared to those obtained through experimental testing. A number of hemispherical product samples have been used with various blank holder forces and drawn to different depths to capture the onset of wrinkling, its mode and location...|$|E
