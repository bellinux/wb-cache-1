5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Frenchman’s Creek {{took place}} during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States {{in the early hours of}} November 28, 1812, in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada, near the Niagara River. The {{operation}} was conceived as a raid to prepare the ground for a larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> their points of attack. They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, “the Battle of Frenchman’s Creek” by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, “the Affair opposite Black Rock”.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{continued}} to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual Royal Rumble match {{as well as}} during an Elimination Chamber match <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the eponymous pay-per-views. In the Chamber match, he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the PPV. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but lost to Gallows. Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost, he would join the Society. At WrestleMania, Punk lost to Mysterio sparking a rematch at Extreme Rules where Punk would have to shave his head, like his disciples, if he lost. Punk won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his face covered. At Over The Limit, a third and final match was booked with both stipulations reactivated. In the match Punk lost and was subsequently shaved bald.|$|E

The 1st Marines and the 11th Marines occupied Tientsin, its airfield, and its approaches. The Taku-Tangku area was garrisoned by 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, and the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 7th Marines held strongpoints along the Tangku–Chinwangtao railroad. Corps troops were stationed mainly in Tientsin, with necessary supporting detachments in the field with division units.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate {{towards and away from}} Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal libration, which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.|$|E

25|$|Electric Ferries' {{franchise}} expired on March 31, 1954, and {{the city}} contracted the 69th Street ferry's operation to Henry Shanks {{in order to keep}} the ferry running. The 69th Street ferry ceased operation in 1964 due to the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge a short distance south. At the time of discontinuation, 7,000 daily passengers paid five cents each to cross, while 8,000 vehicles per day paid a toll of 75 cents to use the ferry. Each boat could fit from 500 to 750 passengers as well as 42 vehicles, which caused traffic jams <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the ferry's slips due to the boats' low capacity. However, the route between St. George and Whitehall Streets was kept since the bridge's opening was expected to spur an influx of residents to Staten Island, potentially increasing ridership on the ferry to Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The longest serving {{director}} of the band was Leonard Falcone, an Italian immigrant and the brother of University of Michigan band director Nicholas Falcone. Many of the band's traditions were established during his 40-year tenure, and the band grew from a 65-member ROTC auxiliary into an adjunct of the new department that would become today’s College of Music. The first green and white uniforms and many other significant changes would happen during this time. When the career of Nicholas came to a premature end due to illness in 1935, Leonard would earn {{the distinction of being}} the only person to direct the bands <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the rival schools concurrently. When MSU began playing Big 10 Conference football in 1952, the band, under Falcone, received its first green and white uniforms. Most of the strict military uniform codes are still adhered to today with squad leaders holding routine inspections before every performance.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Session of the Central Council, held in Moscow from March 9–15, 1926, began {{just as the}} 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI came to a close. <b>At</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these gatherings Solomon Lozovsky had {{delivered}} reports which identified Great Britain — where a miners' strike {{was in the air}} — and in particular the countries of Asia and the Pacific as areas presenting the greatest opportunities for the Profintern in its attempt to construct a world revolutionary movement. Amsterdam had paid scant attention to Asia, leaving the field open to the Profintern's efforts, Lozovsky noted in his report to the Comintern Executive. RILU did make an effort to break new organizational ground outside of Europe as early as February 1922 when it established a Moscow office comparable to the Comintern's Eastern Bureau, headed by Buffalo, New York druggist Boris Reinstein, Bulgarian-American IWW member George Andreychine, and H. Eiduss. But now, even as European prospects dimmed, the situation looked brighter in Asia and the Pacific.|$|E
