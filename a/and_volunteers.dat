5|$|The Mucking {{excavation}} was {{to become}} the largest ever carried out in Britain. To keep ahead of its destruction by the gravel company that owned it, Jones, assisted by her husband Tom, directed work at the site continuously for 13 years. Unusually, they excavated all year round, living in a small caravan and employing a shifting workforce of freelance archaeologists <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> from around the world. When it finally completed in 1978, the excavation covered 44 acres and had recorded 44,000 archaeological features, including Beaker burials; a Bronze Age hillfort; an Iron Age settlement and cemetery; a Roman villa and cemetery; {{one of the most}} significant Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain; two large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries; and a Medieval field system. It involved 5000 archaeologists <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> and recovered 1.7 million finds.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} the main themes and general content of an edited volume on Religion <b>and</b> <b>Volunteering.</b> It starts from the observation {{that the relationship between}} religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> constitutes a key focus of research on volunteering. The ‘default’ perspective posits a strong and positive causal relationship between both phenomena. However, both <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> religion are multi-dimensional and dynamic social phenomena. On closer inspection the relation between them appears to be more complex, contested and ambiguous than is generally assumed. This introduction explores the (intensifying) tensions between religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> from the viewpoint of the particular nature and changing role of religion in society. A fundamental tension originates in the definition of volunteering as a freely chosen activity. From a religious perspective, in contrast, being of service to others is something the pious person does in obedience to God. A second source of tension relates to processes of religious change that include both the return and decline of religion A post-secular perspective is introduced, contributing to a more complex and variable understanding of how religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> interrelate. Against this broader background, the anthology addresses the following questions: How do the relationships between types of religions/religiosity <b>and</b> types of <b>volunteering</b> vary within <b>and</b> across nations? What recent changes in our understanding of society, religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> challenge the default view? What other dimensions, enactments, and consequences of the interplay religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> can be studied beyond the traditional perspective...|$|R

5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E

Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> in Puerto Vallarta worked {{to clear the}} debris caused by the storm.

5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
