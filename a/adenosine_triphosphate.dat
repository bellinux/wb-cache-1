5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E

40|$|We have {{designed}} and synthesized a new hydrogelator Nap-FFGEY (1), which forms a supramolecular hydrogel. A kinase/phosphatase switch is used to control the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the hydrogelator and to regulate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels. Adding a kinase to the hydrogel induces a gel-sol phase transition {{in the presence of}} <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (ATP) because the tyrosine residue is converted into tyrosine phosphate by the kinase to give a more hydrophilic molecule of Nap-FFGEY-P(O) (OH) (2) (2); treating the resulting solution with a phosphatase transforms 2 back to 1 and restores the hydrogel. Electron micrographs of the hydrogels indicate that 1 self-assembles into nanofibers. Subcutaneous injection of 2 in mice shows that 80. 5 (+/-) 1. 2 % of 2 turns into 1 and results {{in the formation of the}} supramolecular hydrogel of 1 in vivo. This simple biomimetic approach for regulating the states of supramolecular hydrogels promises a new way to design and construct biomaterials...|$|R

In addition, bicarbonate HCO−3 releases ATP-Mg2+ substrate inhibition and increases Vmax of the enzyme.|$|R
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E
40|$|The hyperactive {{state of}} sensory neurons in {{the spinal cord}} enhances pain transmission. Spinal glial cells have also been implicated in {{enhanced}} excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons, resulting in pain amplification and distortions. Traumatic injuries of the neural system such as spinal cord injury (SCI) induce neuronal hyperactivity and glial activation, causing maladaptive synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord. Recent studies demonstrate that SCI causes persistent glial activation with concomitant neuronal hyperactivity, thus providing the substrate for central neuropathic pain. Hyperactive sensory neurons and activated glial cells increase intracellular and extracellular glutamate, neuropeptides, <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates,</b> proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species concentrations, all of which enhance pain transmission. In addition, hyperactive sensory neurons and glial cells overexpress receptors and ion channels that maintain this enhanced pain transmission. Therefore, post-SCI neuronal-glial interactions create maladaptive synaptic circuits and activate intracellular signaling events that permanently contribute to enhanced neuropathic pain. In this review, we describe how hyperactivity of sensory neurons contributes {{to the maintenance of}} chronic neuropathic pain via neuronal-glial interactions following SCI...|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} surgery in chronic aortic {{regurgitation}} remains a difficult problem. To identify variables predictive of postoperative haemodynamic improvement, changes in left ventricular mass, volume, morphology, and histochemistry were analysed in 67 patients undergoing surgery for chronic aortic regurgitation. Patients {{were divided into}} two groups: those in whom the left ventricular echo diameters returned to normal after operation (51 patients, group A), and those with postoperative dilatation (16 patients, group B). A preoperative biopsy was obtained in all patients; postoperative tissue samples were available in 13 patients (five from group A, eight from group B). Data were correlated with the postoperative clinical, haemodynamic state over a follow-up period of three years. Regression of hypertrophy was usually incomplete. Echocardiographic and angiographic data could not define the type and degree of dysfunction which was irreversible. Massive fibre hypertrophy (mean 34. 1 micrometers), moderately or severely increased interstitial fibrous tissue, reduced levels of the myofibrillar and mitochondrial enzymes <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates</b> and succinate dehydrogenase in pre- and post-operative tissue samples correlated with persistent dilation, cardiac failure, and early death (group B). Irreversible morphological and functional changes contributed to a depressed cardiac function after operation. Preoperative ventricular biopsies are thus of prognostic importance in volume overload...|$|R
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), {{the universal}} energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

40|$|Dark {{operative}} protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR) catalyzes the light-independent two-electron {{reduction of}} protochlorophyllide a to form chlorophyllide a, the last common precursor of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis. During ATP-dependent DPOR catalysis the homodimeric ChlL 2 subunit carrying a [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster transfers electrons to the corresponding heterotetrameric catalytic subunit (ChlN/ChlB) 2, which also possesses a redox active [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster. To investigate the transient interaction of both subcomplexes {{and the resulting}} electron transfer reactions, the ternary DPOR enzyme holocomplex comprising subunits ChlN, ChlB, and ChlL from the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus was trapped as an octameric (ChlN/ChlB) 2 (ChlL 2) 2 complex after incubation with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs <b>adenosine</b> 5 ′-(γ-thio) <b>triphosphate,</b> <b>adenosine</b> 5 ′-(β,γ-imido) <b>triphosphate,</b> or MgADP in combination with AlF 4 −. Additionally, a mutant ChlL 2 protein, with a deleted Leu 153 in the switch II region also allowed {{for the formation of}} a stable octameric complex. Furthermore, efficient complex formation required the presence of protochlorophyllide. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of ternary DPOR complexes revealed a reduced [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster located on ChlL 2, indicating that complete ATP hydrolysis is a prerequisite for intersubunit electron transfer. Circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments indicated nucleotide-dependent conformational changes for ChlL 2 after ATP binding. A nucleotide-dependent switch mechanism triggering ternary complex formation and electron transfer was concluded. From these results a detailed redox cycle for DPOR catalysis was deduced...|$|R

Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E

Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate.</b> Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

In the animal world, it is essential for many vital enzyme systems among which is the activation of membrane bound <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates.</b> This enzyme system deals with energy production through oxidative phosphorylation and with distribution of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane.

40|$|AbstractMicro-photolithographic {{methods have}} been {{employed}} to form discrete patterns of spinal cord astrocytes that allow quantitative measurements of Ca 2 + wave propagation. Astrocytes were confined to lanes 20 – 100 μm wide and Ca 2 + waves propagated from a point of mechanical stimulation or of application of adenosine triphosphate; all Ca 2 + wave propagation was blocked by simultaneous application of purinergic P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 2 antagonists. Stimulation of an astrocyte {{at one end of}} a lane, followed by further stimulation of this astrocyte, gave rise to Ca 2 + transients in the same astrocytes; however, if the second stimulation was applied to an astrocyte {{at the other end of}} the lane, then this gave rise to a different but overlapping set of astrocytes generating a Ca 2 + signal. Both the amplitude and velocity of the Ca 2 + wave decreased over 270 μm from the point of initiation, and thereafter remained, on average, constant with random variations for at least a further 350 μm. Also, the percentage of astrocytes that gave a Ca 2 + transient decreased with distance along lanes. All the above observations were quantitatively predicted by our recent theoretical model of purinergic junctional transmission, as was the Ca 2 + wave propagation along and between parallel lanes of astrocytes different distances apart. These observations show that a model in which the main determinants are the diffusion of <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates</b> regeneratively released from a stimulated astrocyte, together with differences in the properties and density of the purinergic P 2 Y receptors on astrocytes, is adequate to predict a wide range of Ca 2 + wave transmission and propagation phenomena...|$|R
40|$|In 54 {{patients}} undergoing elective or emergency {{aortocoronary bypass}} grafting, angiographic and electrocardiographic changes were studied. Five patients with unstable angina and five patients with evolving myocardial infarction were included. High energy phosphate metabolism and the histologic {{appearance of the}} myocardium were analyzed in transmural biopsy specimens acquired {{at the time of}} surgery. In patients without anterior infarction on the electrocardiogram, severe stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in a reduction of anterior wall motion that was associated with a partial depletion of the adenylate pool. Mitochondrial function, however, remained intact: the <b>adenosine</b> diphosphate/adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> ratio, the energy charge and the creatine phosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio were in the normal range. Histologic assessment demonstrated viable myocardium with a high incidence of atrophic cells. In evolving myocardial infarction, 170 minutes of acute coronary artery obstruction resulted in anterior wall akinesia associated with a decrease of the sum of the adenylates to 52 % and of creatine phosphate to 16 % of their normal value (p < 0. 05). The nucleosides accumulated; their major fraction (91 %) was inosine. The <b>adenosine</b> diphosphate/adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> ratio increased from 0. 14 ± 0. 04 to 0. 49 ± 0. 20 (p < 0. 01) and the energy charge decreased from 0. 924 ± 0. 021 to 0. 660 ± 0. 169 (p < 0. 01). Ultrastructure examination revealed irreversible cell damage in at least the subendocardial layer. These results suggest that the energetic base of reduced contractility due to severe coronary artery stenosis is different from that in acute coronary obstruction: the decrease in contractile function cannot be explained by a reduced oxidative phosphorylation but may be related to an impaired energy utilization at the myofibrillar level, in analogy with the postischemic reperfused stunned myocardium...|$|R
5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} are hugely {{attractive}} in the tissue engineering research field as they can self-renew and be selectively differentiated into various cell types. For stem cell and tissue engineering research {{it is important to}} develop new, biocompatible scaffold materials and graphene has emerged as a promising material in this area as it does not compromise cell proliferation and accelerates specific cell differentiation. Previous studies have shown a non-invasive optical technique for mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell differentiation and transfection using femtosecond (fs) laser pulses. To investigate cellular responses to the influence of graphene and laser irradiation, here we present {{for the first time a}} study of mES cell fs laser transfection on graphene coated substrates. First we studied the impact of graphene on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K 1) cell viability and cell cytotoxicity in the absence of laser exposure. These were tested via evaluating the mitochondrial activity through <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (ATP) luminescence and breakages on the cell plasma membrane assessed using cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) screening. Secondly, the effects of fs laser irradiation on cell viability and cytotoxicity at 1064 and 532 nm for cells plated and grown on graphene and pure glass were assessed. Finally, optical transfection of CHO-K 1 and mES cells was performed on graphene coated versus plain glass substrates. Our results show graphene stimulated cell viability whilst triggering a mild release of intracellular LDH. We also observed that compared to pure glass substrates; laser irradiation at 1064 nm on graphene plates was less cytotoxic. Finally, in mES cells efficient optical transfection at 1064 (82 %) and 532 (25 %) nm was obtained due to the presence of a graphene support as compared to pristine glass. Here we hypothesize an up-regulation of cell adhesion promoting peptides or laminin-related receptors of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cell samples grown and irradiated on graphene substrates.

5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E

Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (<b>Adenosine</b> <b>triphosphate)</b> in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture.

ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E
