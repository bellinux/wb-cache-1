5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became {{more involved in}} stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour.

5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital {{is the presence}} of a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola had plans to conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front, making administration quicker <b>and</b> <b>easier.</b> Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at the centre of the British isles, being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E

5|$|As secretary, Zahorchak {{implemented}} {{state funding}} for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, training for principals, <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed $200million in Accountability Block Grants {{that were used}} for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet {{the specific needs of}} individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. The African crake is less skulking <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to flush from cover than other crakes, {{and is often}} seen {{at the edges of}} roads and tracks, but the corn crake is a much more difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation and rarely emerging into the open. Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings, flanks and belly like a fan. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker <b>and</b> <b>easier.</b> While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E
