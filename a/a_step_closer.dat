5|$|O'Sullivan {{did not win}} any ranking titles {{during the}} 1994/1995 season, but reached two finals. He lost to James Wattana in {{the final of the}} Thailand Open and to John Higgins in the final of the British Open. At the Masters, O'Sullivan {{captured}} his first title by defeating Higgins 9–3 in the final. With this victory, he became the youngest player ever to win the tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days. and came <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to collecting all the Triple Crown events, only requiring a world title to complete his collection. At the World Championship, he recorded his furthest run yet by reaching the quarter-finals, where he lost 8–13 to Stephen Hendry.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, a quasiregular {{polyhedron}} is a semiregular polyhedron {{that has}} exactly {{two kinds of}} regular faces, which alternate around each vertex. They are edge-transitive and hence <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to regular polyhedra than the semiregular which are merely vertex-transitive. The dual figures is also sometimes considered quasiregular, except that they are edge-transitive, face-transitive, and alternate between two regular vertex figures.|$|E
50|$|The Perch had a two-wheel, solid-axle undercarriage, {{mounted on}} oleo legs joined to the {{fuselage}} {{close to the}} leading edge of the wing and the engine bulkhead. It was braced by rearward struts. The same legs and struts were used when wheels were replaced by floats, though they were augmented with a pair of struts about two-thirds the way along the float, steeply angled back to the lower fuselage. The floats had <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>close</b> to their tip; there was no water-rudder.|$|R
5000|$|Balance : The couple faces {{each other}} with one or both hands joined and, {{in time to the}} music, take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward each other and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> <b>step,</b> then <b>a</b> <b>step</b> apart and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> <b>step.</b> It is typical in some areas to replace the <b>closing</b> <b>steps</b> with <b>a</b> stomp, kick, or jump, giving the figure a strong rhythmic feel. A balance is often {{followed}} by a swing. Balances may also be done in lines or circles, with very similar choreography.|$|R
50|$|A two-step {{consists}} of two steps in approximately the same direction onto the same foot, separated by <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> <b>step</b> with the other foot. For example, a right two-step forward is <b>a</b> forward <b>step</b> onto the right foot, <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> <b>step</b> with the left foot, and <b>a</b> forward <b>step</b> onto the right foot. The <b>closing</b> <b>step</b> may be done directly beside the other foot, or obliquely beside, or even crossed, {{as long as the}} closing foot does not go past the other foot.|$|R
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E
25|$|The dispute centres {{around the}} Parthenon Marbles removed by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, from 1801 to 1803, {{which are in}} the British Museum. A few sculptures from the Parthenon {{are also in the}} Louvre in Paris, in Copenhagen, and elsewhere, but more than half are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. A few can still be seen on the {{building}} itself. The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to Greece. The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation). Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007. These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to a resolution.|$|E

In 1970, Ferraro acquired [...] of U.S. Navy surplus property for $250,000 to build Torrance's Wilson Park. At {{about the same}} time, Ferraro put a plan together to acquire approximately [...] of land in North Torrance to build 'Columbia Regional Park'. By December 1973, the Torrance City Council took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to acquiring land for both Columbia Park and also for Madrona Marsh Preserve, protecting the last vernal marsh and wetlands remaining in the South Bay area of Los Angeles.

500|$|The most {{important}} feature on Salyut 6, however, was {{the addition of}} a second docking port on the aft end of the station, which allowed two spacecraft to be docked at once. This, in turn, allowed resident crews to receive shorter, 'visiting' expeditions whilst they remained on board, and for crew handovers to take place. In addition, it allowed Soyuz spacecraft that had exceeded their operating lifespan to be returned to Earth and replaced by fresh ones (the Soyuz 7K used from 1972–81 had a maximum operating lifespan of three months). Such handovers, with one expedition vacating the station only after the next had arrived, permitted the long sought-after aim of continuous occupation to move <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer.</b> The very first long-duration crew to visit the station broke a long-standing endurance record set on board the American Skylab station, staying 96 days in orbit, whilst the longest expedition lasted 185 days. Some of the visiting expeditions were flown as part of the Intercosmos programme, with non-Soviet cosmonauts visiting the station. Vladimír Remek of Czechoslovakia, the first space traveller not from the US or USSR, visited Salyut 6 in 1978, and the station hosted cosmonauts from Hungary, Poland, Romania, Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam, and East Germany.|$|E
500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon {{could get away}} with [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, but at least the time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E

40|$|Oriented self-avoiding walks (OSAWs) on {{a square}} lattice are studied, with binding {{energies}} between steps that are oriented parallel across a {{face of the}} lattice. By means of exact enumeration and Monte Carlo simulation, we reconstruct {{the shape of the}} partition function and show that this system features a first-order phase transition from a free phase to a tight-spiral phase at β_c=(μ), where μ = 2. 638 is the growth constant for SAWs. With Monte Carlo simulations we show that parallel contacts happen predominantly between <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>close</b> {{to the end of the}} OSAW and another step nearby; this appears to cause the expected number of parallel contacts to saturate at large lengths of the OSAW.
