The Beatles' interest in the Maharishi was led by George Harrison's commitment, and it changed Western <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation.|$|E

The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>about</b> female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure {{knowledge}} and <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> aging and life satisfaction among older Korean adults and to examine the influence of <b>attitude</b> and knowledge <b>about</b> aging on these adults' life satisfaction. MethodsA cross-sectional and correlational design was used. A total of 405 older adults were surveyed using a written questionnaire at six elderly welfare centers in a metropolitan city in South Korea in mid April 2011. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regression. ResultsThe score of knowledge on aging was below the medium level. <b>Attitude</b> <b>about</b> aging was neutral, and life satisfaction was at the medium level. Variables such as female sex, age, economic status, monthly allowance, living with a spouse, self-rated overall health, knowledge and <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> aging accounted for 33. 8 % of the total variance in predicting life satisfaction of the older adults. Older age and lower economic status reduced life satisfaction. Being female, having a monthly income of 300, 000 Korea Republic Won or more, living with a spouse, and better knowledge and <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> aging were associated with enhanced life satisfaction. ConclusionThe effect of knowledge and <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> aging on life satisfaction is significant. Economic status, living with a spouse and self-rated overall health status are also predictive factors in life satisfaction. Consequently, nursing interventions for education and psychological support to increase knowledge about aging and induce a positive attitude towards it should be developed to improve older adults' life satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Attitude</b> <b>about</b> {{mental illness}} determines health seeking of the people. Success of National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) is {{dependent}} on <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> mental illness of various stakeholders in the programme. Material & Methods: A community based cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} Ballabgarh block of Faridabad district in Haryana. We aimed to study <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> mental illness of various stakeholders of health care providers (HCP), community leaders in rural area of Haryana, north India. Study area consisting of five Primary Health Centers (PHCs) serving 2, 12, 000 rural population. All HCP working at PHCs, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and community leaders in study area were approached for participation. Hindi version of Opinion about Mental illness Scale for Chinese Community (OMICC) was used to study attitude. Results: In total, 467 participants were participated in the study. Of which, HCP, ASHAs and community leaders were 81 (17. 4 %), 145 (31. 0 %) and 241 (51. 6 %) respectively. Community members reported socially restrictive, pessimistic and stereotyping attitude towards mentally ill person. ASHA and HCP reported stereotyping <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> person with mental illness. None of the stakeholders reported stigmatizing attitude. Conclusion: Training programme focusing on spectrum of mental illness for HCP and ASHA working in rural area under NMHP programme is needed. Awareness generation of community leaders about bio-medical concept of mental illness is cornerstone of NMHP success in India. </p...|$|R

25|$|That a {{consistent}} psychology {{is required for}} functioning {{in the real world}} also was indicated in the results of The Psychology of Prejudice (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Homoeroticism was idealized in the form of poetry or artistic declarations of love from one man to another. Accordingly, the Arabic language had an appreciable vocabulary of homoerotic terms, with a dozens of word just to describe types of male prostitutes.

Research hypotheses were developed and tested using regression analysis. To test the hypotheses, we distributed 550 questionnaires among the employees in nine insurance companies in South Korea. Finally we used 296 valid responses for our analysis. Two hypotheses showed significant result while others did not show any potential impact. The major findings indicate that <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> shared leadership has {{a positive impact on}} team effectiveness. One dimension of task interdependence, RTID did suppress the relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness. But for ITID, we did not get any positive moderating effect between the relationships. For practical implications it suggests that <b>attitude</b> <b>about</b> shared leadership should be prioritized to accelerate team effectiveness. Moreover, team leadership should use less of RTID when shared leadership is exercised by the team leaders to improve the level of team effectiveness...|$|R
