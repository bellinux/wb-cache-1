5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.

5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with <b>almost</b> <b>anyone.</b> Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E

25|$|Bolder {{even than}} Riemann, Clifford confessed his belief (1870) that matter {{is only a}} manifestation of {{curvature}} in a space-time manifold. This embryonic divination has been acclaimed as an anticipation of Einstein’s (1915–16) relativistic theory of the gravitational field. The actual theory, however, bears but slight resemblance to Clifford’s rather detailed creed.

[...] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season [...] "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season."

500|$|He has two {{abilities}} {{that the original}} Spider-Man did not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, and a [...] "venom strike" [...] that can paralyze <b>almost</b> <b>anyone</b> with just a touch. The venom strike can be conducted through Miles' gloves, {{and can be used}} against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the Earth-616's Spider-Man. It can break chains being used to restrain Miles, and even repels non-ferrous objects, such as plastic Lego bricks. The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as Hank Pym's Giant Man. It is powerful enough to drive away the symbiotic villain Venom during Miles' first encounter with the creature, but by their second encounter, Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host. The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented, and is described by Bendis as being comparable to the feeling of being kicked in the testicles. Miles can effect a more powerful version of the strike, which he calls a [...] "mega venom blast". When Miles employs this ability, his eyes glow with yellow energy, which then explodes outwards in a radiant burst that can destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a [...] "recharging" [...] period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people.|$|E
