40|$|In the {{industrial}} world there are different production processes for the manufacturing of spectacle lens. Nowadays casting {{is the most common}} lens manufacturing method. Here, the mould production is based on three stages: grinding, polishing and hardening, where, in the second step, different sets of process parameters {{play a key role in}} quality, time and cost.

The model is developed for CNC ball polishing of free-form surfaces, where the pad, made of <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer</b> superimposed to a rubber bulk, moves along a scanning path, in a suspension of cerium oxide. The material removal can be derived through pressure and sliding velocity between polishing pad and workpiece and consequently can be related to the CAD-CAM-CNC parameters e. g. tool and workpiece shape, dimension and modulus of elasticity, feed rate, feed step, tool rotational speed and radial tool deformation.

In this study the conductivity was investigated by measuring the square resistance at different stages (i. e. after printing, abrading and washing, respectively).

40|$|The study {{concerns}} the evaluation and {{comparison of the}} thermal performance of building roof elements subject to periodic changes in ambient temperature, solar radiation and nonlinear radiation exchange. A numerical model, based on the finite-volume method and using the implicit formulation, is developed and applied for six variants of a typical roof structure used {{in the construction of}} buildings in Saudi Arabia. The climatic conditions of the city of Riyadh are employed for representative days for July and January. The study gives the detailed temperature and heat flux variations with time and the relative importance of the various heat-transfer components as well as the daily averaged roof heat-transfer load, dynamic R-values and the radiative heat-transfer coefficient. The results show that the inclusion of a 5 -cm thick molded polystyrene layer reduces the roof heat-transfer load to one-third of its value in an identical roof section without insulation. Using <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer</b> instead, reduces the load to less than one-quarter.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of freeform glass components for precision optics is usually based on contour CNC {{grinding and polishing}} operations. To predict the geometrical precision of the production process, a correlation between the geometrical error and the process parameters is required. This {{is even more important}} in the polishing operation which is the final stage of the process. In this work a model for material removal estimation in deterministic polishing of glass moulds is proposed and validated. The model is developed for CNC ball polishing of free-form surfaces, where the pad, made of <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer</b> superimposed to a rubber bulk, moves along a scanning path, in a suspension of cerium oxide. As many models in literature the removed material can be estimated by pressure and sliding velocity between polishing pad and workpiece.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{theoretical}} {{assessments of}} metal/polymer bilayers indicate a potentially significant {{delay in the}} onset of ductile failure modes, especially under dynamic loading, due to strain hardening of the polymer. The response of copper/polyurethane bilayers under dynamic and quasi-static loadings is investigated via static tensile, static bulge forming and dynamic bulge forming tests. Two polyurethanes PU 1 and PU 2 were chosen with a significant contrast in stiffness and ductility: PU 1 has a glass transition temperature Tg close to − 56 °C and at room temperature it has a low modulus, low strength and a high tensile failure strain. In contrast, PU 2 has a Tg of 49 °C and at room temperature it has a high modulus and strength but a much smaller tensile failure strain. In most of the tests, the polymer coatings were approximately twice {{the thickness of the}} metal layer. Under static loadings (tensile and bulge forming) the PU 2 bilayer outperformed the uncoated metal plate of equal mass while the PU 1 bilayer had a performance inferior to the equivalent uncoated plate. We attribute this {{to the fact that the}} PU 2 retards the necking of the copper layer and thus increases its energy absorption capacity while the PU 1 coating provides no such synergistic effect. The dynamic bulge forming tests indicate that on an equal mass basis, the dynamic performance of the PU 2 bilayers with a weakly bonded polymer coating were comparable to the uncoated plates but intriguingly, when the PU 2 was strongly adhered to the copper plates the performance of these bilayers was inferior to that of the uncoated plates. Thus, the coatings do not provide dynamic performance benefits on an equal mass basis. However, it is shown that increasing the mass of a plate by adding <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer</b> can improve the performance for a given total blast impulse. Given the ease of applying polyurethane coatings they may provide a practical solution to enhancing the blast resistance of existing metallic structures...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} years, the {{combination}} of textiles with electronic device have introduced the so called smart/intelligent textiles or wearable computing. The challenge for textile researchers is to make as many components as possible out of textile materials.

40|$|Among many useful {{properties}} of elastomers, one is {{their ability to}} absorb energy by deforming to large strains without fracturing. This property combined with their good adhesion to substrates makes them suited as adhesive films and coatings for protection against impact damage. An example of practical significance is the erosion of helicopter rotor blades where the protection of leading edge is often achieved by mounting a film or applying a coat of polyurethane. Although this is a workable solution, there is currently little knowledge as to the durability of this elastomeric film/coat under impact of hard and angular particles such as sand. A deformation and failure analysis that deals with the angularity of the erodents and captures the local mechanisms responsible for erosion damage in elastomers is the sine qua non. The present endeavor tries {{to address these issues}} by considering <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer</b> on a quasi-rigid substrate, impacted by hard particles at velocities and angles of attack given by pre-specified distributions. A novel method is devised to address the angularity issue. A series of finite-element calculations are performed on the coating layer-substrate systems subjected to different velocities, incidence and angularity of the impacting erodents. An elasto-plastic material constitution with isotropic hardening is employed in the simulations and material parameters representative of polyurethane are used for the coat. Initial parametric deformation analyses provided an adequate qualitative estimate of erosion parameters. Incorporation of a stress based fracture criterion enabled a quantitative measure of material removal due to erosion to be achieved. The simulation results show good match with experimental trends of target mass loss as obtained under normal and inclined loadings with angular erodents. The current simulation framework has sufficient capability and versatility to incorporate more enriched polymer-models and advanced fracture criteria in the future, thereby allowing parametric studies toward selection of materials and coat-layer thicknesses thus predicting the erosion mass loss as accurately as measured by experiments...|$|E
40|$|Smart {{textiles}} and wearable textile systems {{are up to}} now a growing research field, {{with a view to}} applications such as monitoring vital signs or environmental parameters through garments. These developments require new materials such as electroconductive textiles. As a result, research into screen printing of conductive silver inks onto textiles has emerged. In this study, screen printing is used to print four kinds of silver-based conductive inks on a flexible foam and a nonwoven substrate. The screen printing method is chosen because it is a low cost and user friendly technique to obtain flexible and lightweight conductive fabrics. For the evaluation of the electrical properties the square resistance of the printed fabrics is measured after repeated dry cleaning cycles.

This paper aims to investigate the thermal performance of the LASRS. A dynamic model is introduced for analyzing the transient heat transfer through the roofs, which was solved by the control volume finite-difference method employing an explicit scheme and validated by measured data. The simulation results show that the heat flux through the roofing system with <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> insulation <b>layer</b> is smaller than that through the lightweight roof with glasswool insulation R 1. The space cooling load reduction ratio for light painted envelop could reach about 9. 3 % compared with black painted one.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop online {{biosensing}} systems for dialysate tissue metabo- lite detection in real time, to provide an insight into the health of tissue in various in vivo applications. An autocalibration system was developed using LabSmith programmable components to improve the accuracy of results obtained over long monitoring times. A method of col- lecting dialysate into storage tubes for online analysis while retaining temporal resolution was developed and validated. Microfluidic biosensor systems were developed for online measurement of glucose and lactate. One approach employed the use of biosensors, using a combined needle electrode with enzyme encapsulated in a hydrogel layer. The dynamic range of the biosensors was extended by adding <b>an</b> outer <b>polyurethane</b> <b>layer.</b> An alternative approach used automated syringe pumps and valves to develop a microfluidic system for in-flow enzyme addition to the dialysate stream. The existing rsMD system was applied for detection of tissue ischaemia during and after free flap surgery, by measuring dialysate glucose and lactate levels in real time. The system was able to detect flap failure, both during surgery and afterwards in the intensive therapy unit (ITU), much earlier than traditional methods. The rsMD system was adapted to enable monitoring of lactate levels in two dialysate streams and was applied for monitoring isolated porcine kidneys during two methods of cold preservation and subsequent re-warming. Significant differences in the lactate concentrations were observed between the two techniques. The system was extended for use with human transplant kidneys and with both porcine and human pancreases. A novel 3 D printed wearable biosensor system was developed for direct integration with a clinical microdialysis probe. The system considerably improved the lag time and dispersional smearing compared with the existing rsMD system.

Initial clean solution fluxes 5 – 6 L/m 2 /h declined to less than half during short 40 % water recovery tests for all stick water samples. Fish stick water uniquely showed reduced fouling and up to 78 % water recovery. Lost flux was easily restored by rinsing the membrane with clean water. MMF prior to MD removed 92 % of fats, facilitating superior MD performance.

To create the composite, <b>a</b> thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> (TPU) <b>layer</b> with good compatibility to the powder coating was over-molded onto a powder coated aluminum substrate. A polyamide (PA 6) layer was over-molded on to the TPU layer to create a stiff composite structure with possibilities for further functionalization. The TPU-layer in between the metal substrate and the polymer top layer acts as a stress and strain compensation layer. These loads are caused by thermal expansion (under fluctuating temperatures) and external forces/deformation. Another key feature of the composite is the innovative process chain. The powder coating can resist high deformation and therefore the coating is suitable for a future application on to a metal substrate using a coil coating procedure. In addition, the coil could be easily implemented into a production line as a semi-finished product. The prefinished coated metal substrate could be formed (e. g. incremental forming, deep drawing) and inserted in the over-molding procedure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new force sensor design approach that maps the local sampling of pressure inside a composite polymeric footpad to forces in three axes, designed for running robots. Conventional multiaxis force sensors made of heavy metallic materials {{tend to be}} too bulky and heavy to be fitted in the feet of legged robots, and vulnerable to inertial noise upon high acceleration. To satisfy the requirements for high speed running, which include mitigating high impact forces, protecting the sensors from ground collision, and enhancing traction, these stiff sensors should be paired with additional layers of durable, soft materials; but this also degrades {{the integrity of the}} foot structure. The proposed foot sensor is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of an array of barometric pressure sensors completely embedded in <b>a</b> protective <b>polyurethane</b> rubber <b>layer.</b> This composite architecture allows the layers to provide compliance and traction for foot collision while the deformation and the sampled pressure distribution of the structure can be mapped into three axis force measurement. Normal and shear forces can be measured upon contact with the ground, which causes the footpad to deform and change the readings of the individual pressure sensors in the array. A one-time training process using an artificial neural network is all that is necessary to relate the normal and shear forces with the multiaxis foot sensor output. The results show that the sensor can predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 300 N with a root mean squared error of 0. 66 % and up to 80 N in the X- and Y-axis. The experiment results demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a lightweight, low cost, yet robust footpad sensor suitable for use in legged robots undergoing ground locomotion. United States.
