40|$|Aim: To {{estimate}} annual {{direct and}} indirect costs for patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and subtypes. Methods: Patients completed a standardized questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel costs, meals, and productivity loss of patients when seeking treatment for IBS. Total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient were calculated as the sum of direct (including medical and nonmedical) and indirect <b>costs.</b> Total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient among various IBS subtypes were compared. Analysis of variance and bootstrapped independent sample t -tests were performed to determine differences between groups after controlling for IBS subtypes. Results: A total of 105 IBS patients (64. 80 % female), mean age of 57. 12 years ± 10. 31 years), mean disease duration of 4. 31 years ± 5. 40 years, were included. Total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient were estimated as CNY 18262. 84 (USD 2933. 08). Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use were major cost drivers, accounting for 46. 41 %and 23. 36 % of total <b>annual</b> <b>costs,</b> respectively. Productivity loss accounted for 25. 32 % of total <b>annual</b> <b>costs.</b> The proportions of {{direct and indirect}} costs were similar to published studies in other countries. Nationally, the total costs of managing IBS would amount to CNY 123. 83 billion (USD 1. 99 billion). Among the IBS subtypes, total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient of IBS-M was highest at CNY 18891. 18 (USD 3034). Furthermore, there was significant difference in productivity loss among IBS subtypes (P = 0. 031). Conclusion: IBS imposes a huge economic burden on patients and healthcare systems, which could account for 3. 3 % of the total healthcare budget for the entire Chinese nation. More than two-thirds of total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> of IBS consist of inpatient and outpatient healthcare use. Among the subtypes, IBS-M patients appear to have the greatest economic burden but require further confirmation...|$|R

Baseline data from children with IBS or FAP/FAPS who were included in a multicenter trial (NTR 2725) in The Netherlands were analyzed. Patients' parents completed a questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel costs, out-of-pocket expenses, productivity loss of parents, and supportive measures at school. Use of abdominal pain related prescription medication was derived from case reports forms. Total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient were calculated as the sum of direct and indirect medical and nonmedical costs. Costs of initial diagnostic investigations were not included. A total of 258 children, mean age 13. 4 years (± 5. 5), were included, and 183 (70. 9 %) were female. Total <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> per patient were estimated to be € 2512. 31.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Disease-modifying {{treatments}} (DMTs) {{constitute the}} largest {{direct medical cost}} for multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aims at investigating predictors of the 10 -year economic burden for DMT administration and management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 537 newly diagnosed, drug naïve relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, followed up for 10. 1 ± 3. 3  years. Costs for DMT administration and management were calculated, and referred to each year of observation (<b>annual</b> <b>costs).</b> Possible predictors of disease evolution were categorized into early predictors (age, gender, disease duration, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 1 -point EDSS progression within 2  years, and annualized relapse rate -ARR- within 2  years), and long-term predictors (reaching of EDSS 4. 0, conversion to secondary progressive -SP-, ARR, number of DMTs, follow-up duration). Association between predictors and study outcome was explored using mixed-effects log-linear regression models. RESULTS: A 1 -point higher EDSS at diagnosis was associated with 13. 21 % increase in the <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> (95 %CI= 4. 16 - 23. 04 %). Each additional year of age at diagnosis {{was associated with a}} 0. 74 % decrease in the <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> (95 %CI=- 1. 43 to- 0. 04 %). Female gender was associated with a 12. 43 % decrease in the <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> (95 %CI=- 22. 61 to- 0. 93 %). Converting to SP was associated with a 14. 26 % decrease in the <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> (95 %CI=- 14. 26 to- 2. 94 %). Each additional year of follow-up was associated with a 3. 05 % decrease in the <b>annual</b> <b>costs</b> (95 %CI=- 4. 51 to- 1. 57 %). CONCLUSIONS: An estimate of the 10 -year costs associated with DMT administration and management can be calculated by analyzing different factors, and might be of particular interest for planning resources needed for treating people with MS...|$|R

The Commonwealth fortresses were abandoned, but garrisons were placed in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton and Blackness castles. There were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Units included a regiment of foot guards, later known as the Scots Guards and Le Regiment of Douglas, formed and serving in France since 1633, it returned, eventually became the Royal Regiment of Foot. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet, a process complete by 1702, disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. Three troops of Scots Dragoons were raised in 1678 and another three were added to make The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons in 1681.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, the Australian Government {{believed}} that an immediate evaluation of the RAN was necessary. Australia had based its naval policy on the Henderson Recommendations of 1911, developed by Sir Reginald Henderson. The government sent an invitation to Admiral John Jellicoe, he arrived in Australia in May 1919. Jellicoe remained in Australia for three months, before returning to England via New Zealand and Canada. Jellicoe submitted his findings in August 1919, titled the Report on the Naval Mission to the Commonwealth. The report outlined several policies designed to strengthen British naval strength in the Pacific Ocean. The report heavily stressed a close relationship between the RAN and the Royal Navy. This would be achieved by strict adherence to the procedures and administration methods of the Royal Navy. The report also suggested constant officer exchange between the two forces. Jellicoe also called {{for the creation of}} a large Far East Imperial Fleet, which would be based in Singapore and include capital ships and aircraft carriers. The creation cost for this fleet was to be divided between Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand: contributing 75%, 20%, and 5% respectively. The suggested makeup of the RAN would include; one aircraft carrier, two battlecruisers, eight light cruisers, one flotilla leader, twelve destroyers, a destroyer depot ship, eight submarines, one submarine depot ship, and a small number of additional auxiliary ships. The <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> and depreciation of the fleet was estimated to be £4,024,600.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis attempts {{to formulate a}} parametric cost model to estimate the annual operating and support (O&S) cost of future U. S. Navy (nuclear) submarines, based on presumed physical characteristics and manpower expectations. Source data for the analysis is obtained from the Navy's VAMOSC database. Using regression analysis techniques, cost estimating relationships are developed for three assumed cost drivers - manpower, length, and submerged displacement. However, the analysis reveals {{that there is no}} significant relationship between <b>annual</b> O&S <b>cost</b> and the three assumed cost drivers. Therefore, an alternative method of estimating <b>annual</b> O&S <b>cost</b> is presented using probabilistic assessment of cost based on the empirical <b>annual</b> O&S <b>cost</b> distribution. The probabilistic assessment method allows decision-makers and cost analysts to estimate the <b>annual</b> O&S <b>cost</b> for which there is a desired probability that the true <b>annual</b> O&S <b>cost</b> of a new submarine will not be exceeded. For example, historically, 80 percent of all SSNs have experienced <b>annual</b> O&S <b>costs</b> of less than $ 27 M (CY 99 $), while the remaining 20 percent have experienced <b>annual</b> O&S <b>costs</b> greater than $ 27 M (CY 99 $).
