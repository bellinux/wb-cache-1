Typically the taxicabs are Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class along with other, mainly German, brands. Taxicabs are either sedans, station wagons, or MPVs. Common station wagon taxicabs include Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Among the MPVs, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, and Mercedes-Benz Vianos are common. Most taxicabs are automatic transmission, and some have navigation systems on board. Rates are usually near to other western European countries however, in Berlin taxis have a special low fare (€4) called [...] "Kurzstrecke" [...] for distances less than 2 km very useful for old people, except in Portugal in other western European capitals usually the minimum fare to take a taxi costs double; Netherless, the convenience and high quality of public transportation in most German cities eliminates the necessity for German citizens to use taxicabs. Although allowed, [...] "Street Hail" [...] is a relatively uncommon practice in Germany because cabs rarely circle the cities when vacant. Because there are relatively few customers, most cabs return to <b>assigned</b> <b>waiting</b> stations and are called on demand. Although this has proven to be more economic for cab drivers, it is considered very inconvenient for commuters because taxis include the ride from the waiting station to the pickup point in the fare.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{intertwined}} {{factors that}} affect performance of concurrent data structures: the ability of processes to access the shared data in parallel {{and the cost of}} synchronization. It has been observed that for a class of "concurrency-averse" data structures, the use of fine-grained locking for parallelization does not pay off: an implementation based on a single global lock outperforms fine-grained solutions. The combining paradigm exploits this by ensuring that a thread holding the global lock combines requests and then executes the combined requests sequentially on behalf of other (waiting) concurrent threads. The downside here is that the waiting threads are unused even when concurrently applied requests can be potentially performed in parallel. In this paper, we propose parallel combining, a technique that leverages the computational power of waiting threads. The idea is that the combiner thread <b>assigns</b> <b>waiting</b> threads to perform requests synchronously using a parallel algorithm. We discuss two applications of the technique. First, we use it to transform a sequential data structure into a concurrent one optimized for read-dominated workloads. Second, we use it to construct a concurrent data structure from a batched one that allows synchronous invocations of sets of operations. In both cases, we obtain significant performance gains with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithm...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{intertwined}} {{factors that}} affect performance of concurrent data structures: the ability of processes to access the data in parallel {{and the cost of}} synchronization. It has been observed that for a large class of "concurrency-unfriendly" data structures, fine-grained parallelization does not pay off: an implementation based on a single global lock outperforms fine-grained solutions. The flat combining paradigm exploits this by ensuring that a thread holding the global lock sequentially combines requests and then executes the combined requests on behalf of concurrent threads. In this paper, we propose a synchronization technique that unites flat combining and parallel bulk updates borrowed from parallel algorithms designed for the PRAM model. The idea is that the combiner thread <b>assigns</b> <b>waiting</b> threads to perform concurrent requests in parallel. We foresee the technique to help in implementing efficient "concurrency-ambivalent" data structures, which can benefit from both parallelism and serialization, depending on the operational context. To validate the idea, we considered heap-based implementations of a priority queue. These data structures exhibit two important features: concurrent remove operations are likely to conflict and thus may benefit from combining, while concurrent insert operations can often be at least partly applied in parallel thus may benefit from parallel batching. We show that the resulting flat parallelization algorithm performs well compared to state-of-the-art priority queue implementations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Different {{strategies}} {{for addressing the}} challenge of prioritizing elective patients efficiently and fairly have been introduced in Norway. In the time period studied, there were three possible outcomes for elective patients that had been {{through the process of}} priority setting: (i) high priority with <b>assigned</b> individual maximum <b>waiting</b> time; (ii) low priority without a maximum waiting time; and (iii) refusal (not in need for specialized services). We study variation in priority status and waiting time of the first two groups across different medical disciplines. Methods: Data was extracted from the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) and contains information on elective referrals to 41 hospitals in the Western Norway Regional Health Authority in 2010. The hospital practice across different specialties was measured by patient priority status and waiting times. The distributions of <b>assigned</b> maximum <b>waiting</b> times and the actual ones were analyzed using standard Kernel density estimation. The perspective of the planning process was studied by measuring the time interval between the actual start of healthcare and the maximum waiting time. Results: Considerable variation was found across medical specialties concerning proportion of priority patients and their maximum waiting times. The degree of differentiation in terms of maximum waiting times also varied by medical discipline. We found that the actual waiting time was very close to the <b>assigned</b> maximum <b>waiting</b> time. Furthermore, there was no clear correspondence between the actual waiting time for patients and their priority status. Conclusion: Variations across medical disciplines are often interpreted as differences in clinical judgment and capacity. Alternatively they primarily reflect differences in patient characteristics, patient case-mix, as well as capacity. One hypothesis for further research is that the introduction of maximum waiting times may have contributed to push the actual waiting time towards the maximum. The finding that the actual waiting time was very close to the maximum waiting time supports this. The lack of clear correspondence between the actual waiting time for patients and their priority status may imply that urgency, described in the referral letter, and severity of illness, according to guidelines, are two separate entities...|$|R

40|$|The individual, {{organisational}} {{and societal}} impact {{of psychological distress}} among working populations is well established. Recently, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) {{has been identified as}} a promising approach for improving the psychological wellbeing of distressed employees. Nonetheless, few studies have examined the efficacy of ACT in the occupational context and even fewer studies have conducted comprehensive tests of the mechanisms of therapeutic action in ACT. The current research examined the efficacy of a one day ACT intervention that was delivered to NHS employees experiencing psychological distress. A key focus of this research was an examination of the mechanisms of therapeutic action in ACT. In study one, a non-randomised controlled design was used with 17 participants assigned to the ACT intervention and 18 participants <b>assigned</b> to a <b>waiting</b> list. A two-week and three-month follow-up period was used in this study. Participants originally <b>assigned</b> to the <b>waiting</b> list went on to receive the intervention after the three month follow-up and were again assessed at two-weeks and three-months post-treatment. In study two, six of the participants were interviewed about their views on the aspects of the ACT intervention that promoted psychological changes and their responses were analysed thematically. Compared to the control group, participants who received the intervention displayed statistically significant reductions in the severity of psychological distress at two-weeks and three-months post-treatment. Importantly, the majority of participants displayed clinically significant change at both assessments. In line with ACT’s theoretical underpinnings, the intervention significantly increased participants’ psychological flexibility and mindfulness skills and decreased cognitive fusion. However, in a multiple-mediator statistical analysis, improvements in psychological distress were only mediated by improvements in psychological flexibility. The themes generated from the thematic analysis converge with the quantitative data—resembling closely the construct of psychological flexibility.

30|$|In {{the first}} category, the {{proposed}} techniques use a contention mechanism to disseminate warning messages {{based on the}} distance between a receiver and a source node.

The lattice consists of two types of sites – one good conducting (type 1) and the other poor conducting (type 2), distributed at random. The two types of sites are <b>assigned</b> different <b>waiting</b> times (τ 1 for type 1 and τ 2 for type 2). We assume that at intervals of time τr, the site distribution changes. The effect of this rearrangement on the diffusion coefficient is studied with varying τr. We study this effect for different ratios of dwell times of {{the two types of}} sites (R) and also for different fractions (X) of the less conducting sites. An empirical relation for D(τ 1,τ 2,τr,X) is suggested. We have employed the well model and considered diffusion controlled by sites, rather than bonds. So our approach is different from the dynamic bond percolation model, which studies these aspects. Our results show that the diffusion coefficient D may change by a factor of upto 3 (approximately) for rapid rearrangement, and there is a considerable effect of varying X and R on the range of variation of D, where X is the fraction of low conducting sites, and R is the ratio of the dwell times for the two types of sites. Further for τr ¿ 250 τ (τ is the time unit for the random walk) the effect of rearrangement becomes negligible.

40|$|The United States is in {{the midst}} of {{demographic}} transformation that will continue to diversify the cultural, ethnic, racial, and linguistic landscape of the country. Within the last decade, millions of immigrant families have emigrated to the U. S. to escape tremendous hardships in their native countries. These families are guided by the hope of creating a stable, safe, and comfortable environment for their children. Unfortunately, the pathway to citizenship and authorized entry into the U. S. is convoluted (Kremer, Moccio,& Hammell, 2009) and families are frequently <b>assigned</b> <b>wait</b> times that can last several years (U. S. Department of State, 2013). These very long wait times are an unfortunate reality for several families, which is one of the many reasons some families enter the U. S. without authorization. Upon arrival into the U. S., many immigrant families experience anti-immigrant attitudes, prejudicial law enforcement practices, and feel socially isolated. The U. S. born children of these immigrant families are at risk for being separated from their parents who lack authorized resident status. In this regard, over 100, 000 parents of U. S. citizen children were deported between 1998 and 2007 (U. S. Department of Homeland Security, 2012). However, little is known about how these children cope with the loss of their parents. To date, no research has been conducted that measures the psychosocial impact of parental absence because of aggressive immigration enforcement. Thus, a patent need exists for research on the psychosocial implications of parental absence in a child's life because of deportation. This study addressed the psychosocial impact of parental loss because of aggressive immigration enforcement. All participants of this study completed a demographic questionnaire and two technically adequate standardized psychosocial assessments that measured emotional symptoms. A two-group independent samples design was employed that included a sample of youth who were homeless because their parents were impacted by immigration and customs enforcement and a sample of youth who were homeless for other reasons. The present study sought to answer the following questions: Are there significant differences in emotional symptoms between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Are there significant differences in emotional symptoms between U. S. citizen and non-U. S. citizen youth? Do significant differences exist in perceptions of school climate between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Is the quality of relationships with parents significantly different between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Do significant differences exist in emotional symptoms between youth whose parents have been impacted by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE; Impacted by ICE group) in comparison to youth whose parents have been impacted by immigration enforcement for other reasons (Homeless for Other Reasons group) ? Lastly, are there significant differences in perception of school climate between U. S. citizen and non-U. S. citizen youth? Results of this study did not reveal significant differences in emotional symptoms between the Impacted by ICE group and the Homeless for Other Reasons group. However, in terms of how they perceived their relationships with their parents, the Impacted by Immigration group reported more positive relations with their parents. There were significant differences regarding perceptions of school climate between the Impacted by ICE and Homeless for Other Reasons groups. Intra-group analyses within the Impacted by Immigration group indicated significant differences in perceptions of school climate among authorized U. S. citizens and unauthorized non-U. S. citizens.

40|$|Abstract—The main {{wireless}} technology used for events sensing {{and data collection}} is wireless sensor devices. These sensors are mounted on vehicles or in the roadside to send data collected periodically or upon incident detection. In this latter case, ensuring low transmission delay from the detector sensor to WSNs gateway is a real challenge. Indeed, faster notification of the Traffic Management System (TMS) leads to more efficient reaction to the emergency situation. Thus, cars collision and human lives loss as well as road traffic jam will be mitigated. In this paper, we investigate the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer in WSNs to improve the real time data collection scheme. To this end, we propose an enhanced backoff selection scheme for IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol to ensure fast transmission of the detected events on the road towards the TMS. The main feature of our scheme {{is its ability to}} <b>assign</b> a shorter <b>waiting</b> time for messages carrying critical information without changing the basic principle of the backoff mechanism. The obtained simulation results under various scenarios have proven the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of transmission delay reduction...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposal}} in [21] suggests an optimized slotted 1 -persistence scheme for multi-hop communications. As well, the protocol proposes {{the formation of}} vehicle clusters that includes vehicles within the transmission range of each other. Using the elected cluster front and tail vehicles, the protocol proposes a store-carry forward mechanism in sparse networks to reduce the network overhead. Synchronized transmissions and additional overhead required for cluster formation and maintenance are the drawbacks of this scheme. To consider both channel quality and transmission distance in selecting the next relay node, Slavik and Maghoub [22] <b>assign</b> a shorter <b>waiting</b> time to vehicles belonging to a connected dominating set (CDS) and employs acknowledgements for every multi-hop message. The main disadvantage of the scheme is the piggy-backed acknowledgement that is sent {{as part of the}} periodic safety message, increasing its transmission overhead. The work of [14] develops an opportunistic broadcast scheme, in which the relay nodes use a long-range ACK packet to lower the redundant multi-hop transmissions. Moreover, the dissemination of multi-hop messages takes place in two phases: first one for quick propagation of message and second one for increasing the reception reliability. However, interference from the periodic safety messages could result in loss of long-range ACK packets resulting in greater number of retransmissions.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Patients with {{fibromyalgia}} {{have diminished}} levels of physical fitness, which {{may lead to}} functional disability and exacerbating complaints. Multidisciplinary treatment comprising cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and exercise training {{has been shown to}} be effective in improving physical fitness. However, due to the high drop-out rates and large variability in patients' functioning, it was proposed that a tailored treatment approach might yield more promising treatment outcomes. METHODS: High-risk fibromyalgia patients were randomly <b>assigned</b> to a <b>waiting</b> list control group (WLC) or a treatment condition (TC), with the treatment consisting of 16 twice-weekly sessions of CBT and exercise training tailored to the patient's cognitive-behavioural pattern. Physical fitness was assessed with two physical tests before and 3 months after treatment and at corresponding intervals in the WLC. Treatment effects were evaluated using linear mixed models. RESULTS: The level of physical fitness had improved significantly in the TC compared with the WLC. Attrition rates were low, effect sizes large and reliable change indices indicated a clinically relevant improvement among the TC. CONCLUSIONS: A tailored multidisciplinary treatment approach for fibromyalgia consisting of CBT and exercise training is well tolerated, yields clinically relevant changes, and appears a promising approach to improve patients' physical fitness.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} an eight-session mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group intervention programme for treating depression in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Thirty-two depressed CHD patients were assigned to an MBCT treatment group, and a demographically and clinically similar group of 30 cases were <b>assigned</b> to a <b>waiting</b> list control group. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 -month follow-up with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). After each session, MBCT participants completed the post-session Questionnaire on helpful aspects of therapy and after the programme, completed the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. At follow-up, 71 % of the MBCT group was clinically recovered from depression compared with 50 % of the control group. The MBCT group showed significantly greater improvement {{than the control group}} on all measures with effect sizes at follow-up of d[*]=[*] 0. 43 – 1. 0. Increases in mindfulness on the MAAS correlated significantly with improvements on the HADS, BSI, POMS and PAIS. Key helpful aspects of therapy identified by MBCT participants included learning meditation, obtaining group support and developing optimism. There was a high level of satisfaction with the MBCT programme. These results indicate that a randomized controlled trial of MBCT for depressed CHD patients is now warranted...|$|R
