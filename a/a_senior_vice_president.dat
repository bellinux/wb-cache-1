500|$|Discussion {{that led}} to the {{creation}} of the series began in the summer of 2002.

In light of recent corporate accounting scandals, such as Enron and Adelphia, Hurwitz suggested a story about a [...] "riches to rags" [...] family. Howard and Imagine were immediately interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz to write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in the fall of 2002.

Kris Chen, XL's <b>A</b> <b>senior</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not [...] "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about [...] "putting our music on everything, just to put it to anything {{just for the sake}} of money".|$|E
