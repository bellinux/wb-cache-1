5|$|Innovations in Ottawa {{morphology}} {{contribute to}} differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes <b>and</b> <b>word</b> stems; {{the loss of}} final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes; a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating doubt; and a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating plurality on intransitive verbs with grammatically inanimate subjects.|$|E
5|$|Modern English syntax {{language}} is moderately analytic. It has developed {{features such as}} modal verbs <b>and</b> <b>word</b> order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.|$|E

5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock's {{treatment}} by Australian radio stations during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the US, which had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth, with minimal Australian radio promotion.|$|E
5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E
30|$|In the SSNRE project, emotion {{words could}} be grouped into emotion-inducing <b>and</b> emotion-describing <b>words.</b> Additionally, {{a total of}} 395 emotion-inducing <b>words</b> <b>and</b> 218 emotion-describing <b>words</b> have {{underwent}} three psychological experiments with a 9 -point Likert scale.

5|$|In 2011, The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth was published, which {{includes}} sketches and copies of Juster's handwritten drafts <b>and</b> <b>word</b> lists, Feiffer's early drawings, and an introduction and annotations by Leonard S. Marcus. A fiftieth anniversary edition was also published, with appreciations by Maurice Sendak, Michael Chabon and Philip Pullman. More than three million copies {{have been sold}} of the original book in the U.S. alone. It has been adapted into a small-scale opera with music by Arnold Black, and book by Juster and Sheldon Harnick, produced by Opera Delaware in 1995. It was then revamped into a musical that had its debut to strong reviews at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and then made a national tour.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs <b>and</b> <b>word</b> order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E

5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} thousands {{who had come to}} hear his words, he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those {{who took part in the}} great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E

5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly {{in terms of its}} sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) <b>and</b> <b>word</b> order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

5|$|Ayers Rock were an Australian jazz fusion, {{progressive}} {{rock band}} which formed in August 1973. Ray Burton (guitar and vocals), Mark Kennedy (drums), and Duncan McGuire (bass), members of Leo de Castro and Friends, left {{to form the}} eponymous trio of Burton, McGuire & Kennedy. They added a guitarist, Jimmy Doyle, changed their name to Ayers Rock and invited Col Loughnan (saxophones and flutes) to join. The group signed with independent label Mushroom Records in December 1973. Burton left the following March, {{and was replaced by}} Chris Brown (guitar, vocals). With live appearances, coverage in print media <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth the group had a high national profile despite little radio airplay, and journalists praised their musicianship, music, and live energy.|$|E
5|$|Christopher M. Fairman {{graduated}} from the University of Texas at Austin. He taught high-school level history for nine years before returning to his alma mater where he ultimately received his Juris Doctor degree. He worked as a clerk on the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District for Justice J. Woodfin Jones. Subsequently, he was a clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for Judge Fortunato P. Benavides, and worked for the law firm Weil Gotshal in their office in Dallas. Fairman became a professor at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law in 2000. He specialized in areas {{of freedom of speech}} <b>and</b> <b>word</b> taboo, and earned a reputation as an expert on the subject of legal ethics.|$|E
5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews <b>and</b> <b>word</b> of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop in earnings for Silver Linings Playbook, then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E
60|$|For {{the sake}} of simplicity, we may ignore the cases in which sensations {{in their own right}} form part of the content of a belief, and confine {{ourselves}} to images <b>and</b> <b>words.</b> We may also omit the cases in which both images <b>and</b> <b>words</b> occur in the content of a belief.
