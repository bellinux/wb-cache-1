40|$|Objectives: To give an {{overview}} of aspects of silane coupling agents and surface conditioning in dentistry. Methods: Currently, silane coupling agents are used as adhesion promoters. Silanes are effective in enhancing adhesion between resin composite and silica-based ceramics. They do not bond effectively to non-silica based dental restorative materials. Surface conditioning of non-silica based ceramics with silica coating improves the bonding. This current overview {{will focus on the}} silane coupling agents: their properties, limitations in <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> and the clinical problems with the use of silanes. It will also focus on the current surface conditioning methods as well as new surface conditioning techniques to enhance the bonding through conventional silanization approaches. Results: Several surface conditioning methods are being used clinically to enhance the adhesion of resin composites to non-silica based restorative materials. Other approaches are under investigation. The clinical problem of using silanes in <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> is the bond degradation over time in oral environment. Significance: The current silane coupling agents are not ideal. The current silane coupling agents can fulfill the minimum requirements in clinical practice to enhance the bonding of resin composite to dental restorative materials. Developments of novel surface conditioning methods and silane coupling agents are required to address the bond durability problem. © 2012 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Materials for new {{applications}} are often created by combining existing polymers into blends or composites. However most polymer pairs {{tend to be}} immiscible leading to weak adhesion and poor mechanical properties, which can outweigh any advantages gained by blending. Adhesion and mechanical properties can be improved in such systems {{by the addition of}} small amounts of suitable block copolymer to the interface. Adhesion is promoted, firstly by a reduction in the interfacial tension, leading directly to an increase in the thermodynamic work of adhesion, and secondly by increasing the interfacial width, leading to more entanglements between polymer chains and hence greater mechanical reinforcement. In some cases, adhesion is further enhanced by covalent bonds between the block copolymer and the homopolymers. As progress towards nanoscale technology continues in many fields, including biomaterials and electronics, a detailed knowledge of the fundamental origins of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> is becoming ever more vital in the design of new materials. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to examine several important molecular aspects of polymer-polymer <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> by block copolymers involving rubber-rubber and glass-rubber interfaces. The origins of self-adhesion hysteresis in polydimethylsiloxane elastomers were investigated using the JKR contact mechanics technique. Hysteresis was only observed in extracted elastomers and in self-adhesion experiments, suggesting its origins arose from surface interactions and not bulk viscoelasticity. The hysteresis increased with decreasing cross-linking density of the elastomers. When the platinum catalyst used to synthesize the PDMS elastomers was poisoned the hysteresis disappeared implying that a hydrosilylation reaction across the interface was responsible. The JKR method was also used to investigate the contributions to <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> by chain pull-out and covalent bonding using polydimethylsiloxane and polybutadiene elastomers in contact with silane terminated poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane), poly(styrene-b-butadiene) and various functional surfaces. No evidence of adhesion enhancement caused by chain interpenetration was observed over a wide range of experimental and molecular parameters. Adhesion was only enhanced when reactions across the interface were possible. Further experiments involving end-tethered PDMS brushes showed that significant adhesion could be obtained but that this could be explained by the occurrence of various chemical reactions. ...|$|E
40|$|Eph receptors {{and their}} membrane-associated ephrin ligands mediate cell-cell {{repulsion}} to guide migrating cells and axons.

Here we show that cell contact-induced EphB-ephrinB complexes are rapidly endocytosed during the retraction of cells and neuronal growth cones. Endocytosis occurs in a bi-directional manner that comprises of full-length receptor and ligand complexes. Endocytosis is sufficient to promote cell detachment and seems necessary for axon withdrawal during growth cone collapse.

40|$|Abstract Background Apical {{surfaces}} of human endometrial epithelium and endothelium are key elements for {{the initiation of}} molecular interactions to capture the blastocyst or leukocyte, respectively. The L-selectin adhesion system has been strongly proposed {{to play an important}} role in the initial steps of trophoblast <b>adhesion</b> and <b>promotion</b> of integrin-dependent processes, ultimately culminating in the establishment of the embryo-maternal interface. On the basis of these facts, we hypothesized a novel role for pinopodes as the first embryo-fetal contact sites to contain the highest subcellular expression of L-selectin ligand suggesting its role in early adhesion as predicted. Thus, the objective of this study was therefore to determine the subcellular pattern of distribution of the L-selectin ligand (MECA- 79) in human endometrial apical membrane region during the window of implantation. Methods Endometrial biopsies of secretory phases from fertile females ranging in age between 25 and 42 years were studied using several approaches, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunostaining for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunoblotting as well as statistical analysis of the area-related numerical densities of immunoreactive MECA- 79 -bound nanogolds to detect the expression pattern and the subcellular distribution pattern of L-selectin ligand (MECA- 79) in human endometrium during the window of implantation. Results The endometrial biopsies were scored according the dating criteria of Noyes et al. by an experienced histologist. The SEM images of the midluteal phase specimens revealed that fully developed pinopodes were abundant in our samples. HRP-immunostaining and immunofluorescent staining as well as immunoblotting revealed that MECA- 79 was expressed in the midluteal phase specimens. The results of immunogold TEM illustrated the expression of MECA- 79 in human pinopodes in the midluteal phase and a higher area-relate numerical density in pinopodes compared to that of the uterodome-free areas. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of the subcellular localization of MECA- 79 in the human pinopodes which may indicate a novel role for pinopodes to be capable of shear-stress-dependent tethering-type adhesion in the initial phases of human embryo implantation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Onset of {{the cancer}} mesenchymal program is closely {{associated}} with cancer malignancy and drug resistance. Among the different epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) -associated transcriptional factors, ZEB 1 has {{a key role in}} inducing the mesenchymal phenotypes and stem cell-like properties of different breast cancer cells. ARF 6 and its effector AMAP 1 are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and promote invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. EPB 41 L 5 is induced during EMT, and mediates the disruption of E-cadherin-based cell-cell <b>adhesion</b> and the <b>promotion</b> of focal <b>adhesion</b> dynamics. Here we show that EPB 41 L 5 is an integral component of the ARF 6 -based pathway, which is induced by ZEB 1. We found that EPB 41 L 5 is expressed at high levels in malignant breast cancer cells and binds to AMAP 1. ZEB 1 induced EPB 41 L 5 both in cancer cells and normal cells. This relationship was recaptured with The Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq data set, and correlated with the poor outcome of the patients. In contrast, diversified events, such as tumor growth factor beta 1 stimulation, expression of SNAI 1 and TP 53 mutation, can each cause the induction of ZEB 1 and EPB 41 L 5, depending on the cellular context. Our results demonstrated that the ZEB 1 -EPB 41 L 5 axis is at the core {{of the cancer}} mesenchymal program that drives ARF 6 -based invasion, metastasis and drug resistance of significant populations of primary breast cancers, and is tightly correlated with the poor outcomes of patients...|$|R

40|$|This work aims to {{investigate}} the conformational transition of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on copper (Cu) under influence of different electrical field strength through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

With different SAM conformation on Cu, the performance in adhesion between Cu/Epoxy was also investigated. Epoxy model was incorporated for predicting the adhesive strength between SAM-modified Cu/Epoxy interface by using MD simulation.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Wnt {{signaling}} {{is thought}} to be important in prostate cancer, in part because proteins such as beta-catenin can also affect androgen receptor signaling. beta-Catenin forms a cell adhesion complex with E-cadherin raising the possibility that loss of expression or a change in beta-catenin distribution in the cell could also alter downstream signaling, decreased inter-cellular <b>adhesion</b> and the <b>promotion</b> of metastasis. A number of studies have reported the altered expression and/or localization of beta-catenin as a biomarker in prostate cancer. METHODS. Tissue microarrays comprised of BPH and low, moderate and high-grade prostate cancer (n = 77) were assessed for beta-catenin expression and distribution using immunohistochemistry. Staining was also performed on a tissue microarray containing tissue from patients before and after hormone manipulation. The effects of fixation and different antibodies was assessed on fixed LNCaP cell pellets and small prostate tissue microarrays. RESULTS. We have observed increased beta-catenin expression in only high Gleason score (> 7) prostate cancer. A nuclear re-distribution of beta-catenin has previously been reported. We noted nuclear beta-catenin in benign prostatic hyperplasia and a gradual loss in nuclear distribution with increasing Gleason grade. We found no evidence for an alteration in beta-catenin expression or redistribution with hormone ablation. Altered fixation, antibodies and antibody concentration did affect the intensity and specificity of staining. CONCLUSIONS. A loss of nuclear beta-catenin is the most consistent feature in prostate cancer rather than absolute levels of expression. We also suggest that variation in immunohistochemical protocols may explain variations in the reported literature...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that activation of vascular endothelium by the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi results in enhanced expression of endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecules and <b>promotion</b> of the transendothelial migration of neutrophils in vitro. To investigate {{the role of}} spirochetal lipoproteins in this process, we assessed {{the ability of a}} synthetic lipohexapeptide corresponding to the N terminus of B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA) to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated that OspA lipopeptide activated endothelium in a dose-dependent fashion, as measured by upregulation of E-selectin. Near-maximal stimulation was achieved with 100 micromolar lipopeptide. In addition, the lipopeptide increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1). Similar results were obtained with 25 nM native OspA or lipidated recombinant OspA or OspB. Incubation of HUVEC with nonlipidated OspA peptide, nonlipidated recombinant OspA or OspB, or tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine had little or no effect on expression of these adhesion molecules. A mutant strain of B. burgdorferi that lacked OspA and OspB upregulated expression of E-selectin to the same degree as its wild-type counterpart, indicating that other spirochetal components also possess the ability to activate endothelium. Conditioned medium from HUVEC incubated with OspA lipopeptide or lipidated recombinant OspA induced chemotaxis of neutrophils in Boyden chamber assays, whereas the OspA preparations alone were devoid of chemotactic activity. When HUVEC grown on connective tissue substrates were treated with OspA lipopeptide, subsequently added neutrophils migrated across the endothelial monolayers. These results implicate the outer surface lipoproteins of B. burgdorferi as potential effector molecules in the promotion of a host inflammatory response...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the form and}} distribution of muscle and nonmuscle actin within retinal pericytes. Antibodies with demonstrable specificities for the actin isoforms were used in localization and immunoprecipitation experiments to identify those cellular domains that were enriched or deficient in one or several actin isoforms. Living pericyte behavior was monitored with phase-contract video microscopy before fixation to identify those cellular areas that might preferentially be stained with either of the fluorescent antiactins or phallotoxins. Antibody and phallotoxin staining of pericytes revealed that nonmuscle actin is present within membrane ruffles, pseudopods, and stress fibers. In contrast, muscle actin could be convincingly localized in stress fibers, but not within specific motile areas of pericyte cytoplasm. To confirm and quantitatively extend the results obtained by fluorescence microscopy, nonionic and ionic detergents were used to selectively extract the motile or immobilized (stress fiber- containing) regions of biosynthetically labeled pericyte cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitated actins that were present within these discrete cellular domains were subjected to isoelectric focusing in urea- polyacrylamide gels before fluorographic analysis. Scanning laser densitometry of the focused actins could not reveal any detectable alpha-actin within those beta- and gamma-actin-enriched motile regions extracted with nonionic detergents. Moreover, when pericyte stress fibers are completely dissolved by ionic detergent lysis, three actin isoforms can be quantified {{to be present in}} a ratio of 1 : 2. 75 : 3 (alpha:beta:gamma). These biochemical findings on biosynthetically labeled and immunoprecipitated pericyte actins confirm the fluorescent localization studies. While the regulatory events governing this actin sorting are unknown, it seems possible that such events may play important roles in controlling cell shape, <b>adhesion,</b> or the <b>promotion</b> of localized cell spreading...|$|R

Microstructural analysis shows that void formation can be observed at this interface. The mechanisms of silicide and void formation from plated layers on solar cells are studied taking into account different electrolytes and pretreatments. The cavities can be removed by selective nickel etching and replating nickel onto the formed silicide after silicide pretreatment.

S-layers are generally {{composed of a}} single self-assembling (glyco) protein species and can fulfil a number of roles including shape maintenance, exo-enzyme <b>adhesion,</b> and virulence <b>promotion.</b> Engineered S-layers carrying functional inserts at high density also show potential in nanotechnology. However, there is currently no complete structure at atomic resolution available for any S-layer protein. This work is engaged in the (i) structural elucidation of the SbsB S-layer protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus by determining the surface location of individual residues. A cross-linking screen was used to analyse 23 cysteine residues, known to be surface accessible in the monomer, {{with respect to their}} position within the assembled S-layer. The study was able to distinguish between eight residues that are positioned close to the subunit-subunit interface and 10 residues located at the cell-wall facing inner surface. The assay also confirmed the previous assignment of four residues to the outer ambient-exposed surface. The tolerance of the individual sites to insertion of a short peptide sequence was investigated to (ii) create chimeric S-layer proteins for nanobiotechnological applications and (iii) advance the structural elucidation of SbsB. Insertion mutagenesis at nine of the surface sites led to mutants of conserved tertiary structure, of which six were assembly-positive. The six proteins provide model constructs for the incorporation of functional tags into S-layer arrays for nanobiotechnology application as high-density vaccine carriers. The mutagenesis screen also revealed three mutants of conserved tertiary structure but of assembly-negative phenotype. The potential of forming 3 D crystals for X-ray crystallography was tested with one mutant yielding small crystals.

40|$|Introduction: The {{longevity}} of silane promoted adhesion of surface conditioned metallic materials {{is of concern}} in dentistry and poses both a functional and esthetic dilemma for the patient and dental professionals. Several methods for surface conditioning exist, but some are employed more frequently in clinical practice. Aim of the Review: This overview aims to characterize and discuss {{the most commonly used}} surface conditioning methods based on silanization. The primary chemical features in silane treatment will also be presented. Method of Review: The literature regarding silane utilization was systematically selected and 68 cited references published during 1967 - 2005 were reviewed. Technical descriptions of different silica-coating (silicatization) methods are presented and some comparative clinical and in vitro experiences are reported.

Two silanes, both in 0. 1 and 1. 0 vol-% in ethanol-water, were evaluated in the attachment of an experimental bis-phenol-A-diglycidyldimethacrylate (Bis-GMA) resin to grit-blasted (with two different systems) titanium. Silane hydrolysis was monitored by FTIR spectrometry. Bis-GMA resin was applied and photo-polymerized on titanium. The specimens were thermocycled (6000 cycles, 5 - 55 °C). Surface analysis was carried out with scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that the highest shear bond was achieved with 0. 1 % 3 -isocyanatopropyl- triethoxysilane (12. 5 MPa) with silica-coating, and the lowest with 1. 0 % 3 -methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (3. 4 MPa) with aluminacoating. The silane, its concentration, and the grit-blasting method significantly affected the shear bond strength (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an {{extensively}} used {{material in}} dentistry {{because of its}} aesthetics, processability, and reparability. However, PMMA is still far from being ideal in fulfilling the mechanical requirements of prosthesis. PMMA-based denture base polymers exhibit low fracture resistance and radiopacity behavior. Efforts to improve the mechanical and radiopacity properties of denture base materials through inclusion of silica-based fillers are ongoing. Although silane-treated siliceous fillers are commonly used, they are not sufficiently strong. They also exhibit cracks, which either cut through the glass fillers or propagate around the filler particles. This defect occurs when the dental composites are placed in aqueous oral environment because of the hydrolytic degradation of silica-based fillers and silane-coupling agents.

However, both its aberrantly up- and down-regulated expression was observed in several types of cancer. Thus, the mechanisms that regulate galectin- 3 expression in neoplastic settings are not clear. In order to demonstrate the putative role of hypoxia in regulating galectin- 3 expression in canine mammary tumors (CMT), in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In malignant CMT cells, hypoxia was observed to induce expression of galectin- 3, a phenomenon that was almost completely prevented by catalase treatment of CMT-U 27 cells. Increased galectin- 3 expression was confirmed at the mRNA level. Under hypoxic conditions the expression of galectin- 3 shifts from a predominant nuclear location to cytoplasmic and membrane expressions. In in vivo studies, galectin- 3 was overexpressed in hypoxic areas of primary tumors and well-established metastases. Tumor hypoxia thus up-regulates the expression of galectin- 3, which may in turn increase tumor aggressiveness...|$|E

The cotton & viscose composite appears to be the best materials combination, exhibiting improved breaking force (0. 5 % of Xylanase PLUSTM) and percentage of elongation at maximum force (0. 1 % of Xylanase PLUSTM), as well as better results on the peel adhesion test (0. 5 % of AlternaFuel® MAXTM). The flax & cotton combination did not show any improvement for all the tested properties. Flax & viscose combination, despite not having shown peel strength improvement, exhibits remarkable elongation and breaking force (0. 5 % ofXylanase PLUSTM). Since there is no posterior emission ofvolatile products, one canexpect agreat public acceptance.

40|$|The present review {{highlights}} {{an association}} between autism, Alzheimer disease (AD), and fragile X syndrome (FXS). We propose a conceptual framework involving the amyloid- peptide (A), A precursor protein (APP), and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) based on experimental evidence. The anabolic (growth-promoting) effect of the secreted form of the amyloid- precur-sor protein (sAPP) {{may contribute to the}} state of brain overgrowth implicated in autism and FXS. Our previous report demonstrated that higher plasma sAPP levels associate with more severe symptoms of autism, including aggression. This molecular effect could contribute to intellectual disability due to repression of cell–cell <b>adhesion,</b> <b>promotion</b> of dense, long, thin dendritic spines, and the potential for disorganized brain structure as a result of disrupted neurogenesis andmigra-tion. At the molecular level, APP and FMRP are linked via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5). Specifically, mGluR 5 activation releases FMRP repression of APP mRNA translation and stimulates sAPP secretion. The relatively lower sAPP level in AD may contribute to AD symptoms that significantly contrast with those of FXS and autism. Low sAPP and production of insoluble A would favor a degenerative process, with the brain atrophy seen in AD. Treatment with mGluR antagonists may help repress APP mRNA translation and reduce secretion of sAPP in FXS and perhaps autism. Neurology ® 2011; 76 : 1344 – 1352 GLOSSAR...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} {{is fundamental}} {{for the organization}} of cells in multicellular organisms since it has {{a key role in}} several physiological functions that drive tissue formation and development. A better knowledge of the affections that influence the adhesion capability of cells in several pathologies, such as cancer diseases or multiple sclerosis could enable the development of new therapeutical strategies. Whereas the optimal control of cell adhesion and growth on new technological materials is a primary issue in modern tissue engineering, few techniques are able to provide quantitative and reliable results on cell adhesion. We present a method that enables the investigation of cell adhesion at the single cell level and provides the capability to test the adhesion of a single cell on multifunctional substrates. To reach this goal we applied single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) on custom designed patterns of molecules prepared on a rigid substrate by using a cantilever based molecule deposition tool, and we tested the adhesion of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and Human Embrionic Kidney cells on two polyelectrolytes that are widely used as adhesive factors for cells growth: Polyethylenimine and Poly-D-Lysine. Our results confirm the common hypothesis on the mechanism of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> by protonated molecules. Optimizations of the experimental settings of SFCS experiment are introduced here. The presented technique offers the unique opportunity to be extended to the study of cell adhesion on an unlimited number molecular species...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} {{are of a}} {{great interest}} for wearable and implantable medical devices due to their conformality with the body, compared to electronics made on rigid carriers. Packaging of such electronics needs to offer sufficient flexibility and in addition, has to provide good protection for the electronics inside, also in humid and harsh environments, to prevent device failure due to corrosion. Parylene C is a popular polymer due to its interesting diffusion barrier properties. Parylene C coatings are also extremely conformal, hence it offers the possibility {{to be used as}} flexibleprotecting encapsulation for electronic components and interconnects. In order to provide sufficient mechanical support for the electronic circuit, a second encapsulation in PDMS will be performed. In our work, we study the barrier properties of Parylene for long time exposure to moisture and biofluids. Since adhesion is a very important parameter to prevent corrosion, this property is studied in detail. Various substrates and various <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> treatments are evaluated. Furthermore, copper interconnects coated with parylene C are immersed in biofluids at 37 C to study corrosion. Accelerated testing is also performed at 70 C to mimic long time exposure in a harsh, humid environment. Since the Parylene barrier layers are typically 5 - 15 micron thick, they are highly flexible, and hence they are interesting barriers to be used in flexible/stretchable electronics. Therefore, special attention is given to the evaluation of barrier properties when Parylene is bended and stretched...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{modification}} of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films {{is done by}} exposing the films to a sodium naphthalenide (Na/naphtha) etchant, and esterification of 4, 4 '-azobis(4 -cyanopentanoic acid) (ACP) with the hydroxyl groups covalently linked to the surface, followed by the surface-initiated free radical polymerization of 4 -vinylpyridine (4 VP). The surface elemental composition and topography of the poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PVP) graft-functionalized PTFE surfaces (PTFE-g-PVP surfaces) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Water contact angles on the pristine PTFE surface and PTFE-g-PVP surfaces were measured. The PVP brushes on the PTFE surface with well-preserved pyridine groups were used not only as the chemisorption sites for the palladium complexes (without the need for prior sensitization by SnCl 2) during the electroless plating of copper, but also as an <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> layer to enhance the adhesion of the electrolessly deposited copper to the PTFE surfaces. The T-peel adhesion strength of the electrolessly deposited copper to the PVP grafted PTFE (PTFE-g-PVP) surface could reach about 7. 2 N/cm. This adhesion strength was much {{higher than that of}} the electrolessly deposited copper to the pristine or Na/naphtha-treated PTFE surface. Effects of the graft polymerization time and the activation time in the PdCl 2 solution on the T-peel adhesion strength of the electrolessly deposited copper (from the Sn-free process) to the PTFE-g-PVP surface were determined.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a series of {{endogenous}} and exogenous inflammatory mediators are potent activators of circulating granulocytes, damage of vascular endothelium, a primary target tissue, is a rather unusual event in systemic inflammatory states. Since mediator-induced neutrophil hyperadhesiveness on plastic tissue culture dishes is invariably accompanied by intense release of lysosomal granule constituents and respiratory burst activation, thus representing a powerful model to investigate neutrophil cytotoxic states, comparative studies with neutrophils suspended in autologous plasma in {{the presence or absence of}} N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (2. 5 microM), the most potent adhesion inducer, were performed on different biologic surfaces. On optimally adherent closed monolayers of cultured endothelial cells or fibroblasts we observed poor stimulation of adhesion as well as minimal granule release and hexose monophosphate pathway activation. Functional behavior of neutrophils on single molecular components of basal laminas such as fibronectin and collagen (type IV) coats was intermediate, with positive <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> but markedly reduced metabolic activation. When tested on endothelial cell-derived extracellular matrices, neutrophils again showed functional nonresponsiveness to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an impressive congruency between the degree of cellular spreading and metabolic activation in the presence of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, with maximally flattened neutrophils on plastic vs. nonspread, polarized cells on monolayers. Identical results were obtained by using other adhesion inducers such as complement-activated plasma or endotoxin. Lack of cell injury by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-exposed neutrophils was corroborated by the absence of tracer release from [111 In]tropolonate-labeled endothelium. These results indicate that biologic surfaces possess antiadhesive properties that protect them from cytotoxic damage by stimulated angry phagocytes...|$|E
40|$|During the {{synthesis}} of zirconium Schiff-base polymers {{it became apparent that}} the polymers adhere quite strongly to the silica (glass) vessels in which they were recrystallized from dimethyl sulfoxide solution. This observation inspired the following research:^ A new soluble linear Schiff-base zirconium-containing coordination polymer poly((N,N',N",N"'-tetrasalicylidene- 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine) -zirconium(IV)) ((Zr(tsdb)) n) has been synthesized via the condensation of 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine with tetrakis(salicylaldehydato-O,O') zirconium(IV) in dry dimethyl sulfoxide. Molecular weights have been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and viscosity measurements. A copolymer average degree of polymerization of up to 92 has been obtained by careful stoichiometric control and fractionation. The polymer shows high thermal stability to about 500 ∘C and has a glass transition temperature of about 74 ∘C. An electronic charge-transfer transition occurs at about 400 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 30, 000 L(mol Zr) - 1 cm- 1. ^ The interface interaction between the polymer and oxides (glass and alumina) has been studied. A series of (Zr(tsdb)) n polymers with different end group ratios were used for the surface coverage studies. Polymers with more zirconium end groups obtain higher surface coverage. The interface bonding, Zr-O-Si, is identified from Fourier-transform infrared at 990 cm- 1. Scribe-stripping tests show adhesion vanishes after the polymers are end-capped. ^ (Zr(tsdb)) n oligomers couple with (±) -β-butyrolactone and stearoyl chloride to produce organic hybrid copolymers. These copolymers have been synthesized for the study of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> for polymeric coatings on glass and aluminum substrates. Based on scribe-stripping, indentation debonding, and peel tests, results with films of poly(methyl methacrylate), polybutyrolactone, polythylene, and polypropylene show that adhesion increases when the substrates are pretreated with these hybrid copolymers. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aircraft}} industry, an increasing demand for <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> layers for titanium based materials is observed to replace polluting and unhealthy substances. Plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD) at atmospheric pressure (AP) seems to be favourable for the deposition of thin silica-like layers. In this work, a linearly extended and scalable DC arc plasma source is used for PECVD of silica layers on Ti 6 Al 4 V. The influence of the precursor chemistry is evaluated for HMDSO and TEOS precursors. Using HMDSO, hydrophobic almost stoichiometric SiO 2 coatings with a carbon content of 3 at. -% to 5 at. -% are deposited on the titanium alloy substrate. For TEOS, hydrophilic carbon-free stoichiometric SiO 2 coatings are deposited. The dynamic deposition rate for TEOS is 3 times lower t han that for HMDSO (up to 640 nmm/min). For the intended coating of slightly curved substrates, the film properties and deposition rates are studied for different working distances from 20 mm up to 60 mm. For 60 mm the deposition rate is reduced by a factor 6 compared to 20 mm, also the index of refraction of the film decreases from 1. 45 at 20 mm distance to 1. 39 at 60 mm. With increasing distance, the particle size and concentration on the surface increases and leads to less dense structures than {{in the case of}} shorter distances. The wedge test is used to evaluate the adhesion properties of the layer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bonding of {{restorative}} {{materials in}} dentistry may be enhanced significantly {{by the use}} of engineered silane blends. Trialkoxy silane esters have the unique property to unite dissimilar materials. Silanization is required when cementing the crown or the abutment on a silica-coated zirconia subgingival implant surface with an organophosphate-resin-composite. In this laboratory study, we report about our latest findings in laboratory experiments on experimental silane primers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> of resin-composites to the zirconia implant surface using four experimental blends, a so-called 'Novel Silane System', consisting of a functional silane (3 -acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 3 -styrylethyltrimethoxysilane) and a cross-linking silane, bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane, were mixed in a water/ethanol solvent system with a pH of 4. 5, and applied onto silica-coated planar zirconia specimens. A resin composite stub (with a bonding area diameter of 2. 0 mm) was cemented using a polypropylene mold. Initial shear bond strengths (baseline values) were measured of specimens after dry storage and after thermo-cycling between 5. 0 +/- 0. 5 degrees C and 55. 0 +/- 0. 5 degrees C. As the control was a dental prehydrolyzed ready-to-use silane product. RESULTS: All the values for shear bond strength test were significantly increased (P > 0. 05) during thermo-cycling. The results showed that the highest shear bond strength was obtained for 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane +bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane in both dry and thermo-cycled conditions with stress values of 11. 04 and 14. 89 MPa, respectively. The lowest values were found for the control silane in both dry and thermo-cycled conditions with stress values of 4. 5 and 6. 5 MPa, respectively. CONCLUSION: Silanization with a novel silane system yielded significantly higher shear bond strength than the control silane (a 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane containing). We have introduced a bonding system that might be useful and durable in implant dentistry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
