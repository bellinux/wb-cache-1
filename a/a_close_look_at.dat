The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E

25|$|The Dead Sea Transform, {{also known}} as the Levant Fracture, {{produces}} strong but infrequent earthquakes, and all pre-instrumental information regarding the area shows that it was experiencing an inactive period during the twentieth century. Researchers M. Vered and H. L. Striem conducted a study on both the 1927 Jericho earthquake and the January 1837 event, with <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> damage data to gain a good estimate of Modified Mercalli intensity values. The 1927 event was both macroseismically and instrumentally recorded, and that provided a good opportunity to closely examine the macroseismic and instrumental epicenter location, estimates of its depth, and methods used in the macroseismic investigation. Once validated, the processes of analyzing the macroseismic data were applied to the earlier 1837 event. The meizoseismal areas of both of these Jordan Rift Valley events were along a north-south line near the fault zone.|$|E

500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world, keep on doing so {{and in the end}} it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E

[...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E

She lived in [...] "the highest military, political, and social circles,” and became friends with First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Maria was not as happy adjusting to “Yankee life,” describing it in a letter to a friend as “’a humbug so methodical and well supported that they even almost believe it.'” [...] This gave her <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the corruption in the government, which she would later use in her writings critiquing U.S. society and government.
