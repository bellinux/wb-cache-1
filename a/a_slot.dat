That year, he roomed with Trotwood {{teammates}} Shaw and Moore. He had just two receptions {{in the first}} eight {{games of the season}} while playing as a backup. He became a starter for the team's final four games, and finished as the leading receiver for the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team in terms of both yards and receptions per game, despite the limited playing time. One of the two early-season receptions occurred on October 3 against Michigan State in the Paul Bunyan Trophy game when he caught the game-tying touchdown with two seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. He made his first start on October 31 against the Illinois Fighting Illini as <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> receiver. On November 7, against Purdue he had ten receptions for 126 yards. He also had nine receptions for 116 yards in the November 21, 2009 game against the rival Ohio State Buckeyes.

40|$|Slotting allowances—lump sum {{transfers}} from {{manufacturers to}} retailers for carrying new products—have {{become an important}} part of promotional agreements over the past decade. Hardly known before the mid- 1980 s, they now represent a significant cost to launching a new entry {{in a wide range of}} product categories. Despite being commonplace, slotting allowances have remained extremely controversial both with manufacturers and retailers. The controversy, in part, follows from a poor understanding of the role that slotting allowances actually play in new product introductions. We attempt to clarify the purpose slotting allowances serve by relating the payment of <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance to the retailer's cost structure and informational asymmetries within a channel. We consider a manufacturer introducing a new product into a retail channel. The retailer is independent of the manufacturer and only accepts the product if he expects to recover a positive fixed cost at the terms of trade offered by the manufacturer. Following acceptance, the retailer exerts merchandising effort and sets the retail price. We show that if the manufacturer and the retailer are equally informed of the product's demand, the terms of trade never include <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance. High retail costs are compensated through a lower wholesale price. Similarly, if the manufacturer is better informed of the product's demand, she prefers to convey that information through the wholesale price alone. That is, a high wholesale price, not <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance, is the manufacturer's preferred signaling instrument. Signaling with the wholesale price alone fails, however, when the retailer has high fixed costs. To convey information and assure retailer participation, the terms of trade must include <b>a</b> positive <b>slotting</b> allowance. <b>A</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance thus serves two purposes in launching a product: passing information down to the retailer and shifting costs up to the manufacturer. We show that the manufacturer prefers paying <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance to undertaking purely wasteful advertising. A principal virtue of <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance, then, is keeping money within the channel. Our work is novel along two important dimensions. First, others (e. g., Chu [Chu, Wujin. 1992. Demand signaling and screening in channels of distribution. (4, Fall) 327 – 347. ]) have assumed that slotting fees arise as manufacturers respond to retailer demands. Here, the manufacturer willingly offers an allowance. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> consequence, <b>slotting</b> allowances do not represent a windfall for the retailer; he merely breaks even on a product for which <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance is paid. Second, we tie the payment of <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance to the retailer's fixed cost and the overall terms of trade. This allows us to consider a number of comparative statics with interesting implications. For example, a retailer may receive <b>a</b> <b>slotting</b> allowance for some categories and not for others if his costs differ across categories. A “slotted” product is offered at a lower wholesale price which results in greater retailer effort than for a product on which no allowance is paid. Over a range of fixed costs, greater retailer effort should be correlated with <b>a</b> higher <b>slotting</b> allowance. Finally, for a specific functional form, we show that slotting allowances become more common (in the sense that they are paid over a greater range of retailer costs) as the retailer has greater merchandising ability. slotting allowances, channel management, asymmetric information, new product introductions, signaling, performance guarantees...|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it.
