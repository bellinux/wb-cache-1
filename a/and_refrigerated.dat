5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> ships.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish-built {{vessel was}} {{launched}} in 1924 as a combination passenger liner <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> cargo ship and operated a trade route between Western Australia and Singapore via the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), carrying passengers, cargo, and livestock. At the start of World War II, Centaur (like all British Merchant Navy vessels) was placed under British Admiralty control, but after being fitted with defensive equipment, was allowed to continue normal operations. In November 1941, the ship rescued German survivors of the engagement between Kormoran and HMAS Sydney. Centaur was relocated to Australia's east coast in October 1942, and used to transport materiel to New Guinea.|$|E

In the UK, the financial year 1991–1992 saw around 100 refrigerated meat trucks destroyed by incendiary devices {{at a cost of}} around £5 million.

The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour.

25|$|Dry ice {{is easily}} manufactured.) Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26}} First, gases {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E

As originally envisioned, a crew of three would be carried: pilot, navigator and radar operator. All three were to be contained within the same compartment, which was both pressurised <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> for passenger comfort; lightweight ejection seats were to be provisioned for all crew members.
