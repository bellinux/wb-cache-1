5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva, a cadet who, {{contrary}} to Lasky's beliefs, {{is a full}} supporter of {{the war against the}} insurrectionists. Popplewell portrays Silva as <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience.|$|E
5|$|Being born to {{an aristocratic}} family in England, he entered {{military}} service, seeing {{action in the}} French and Indian War, where he served alongside his future opponent George Washington in the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela. After the fall of Montreal in 1760, he was named its military governor. During this time he did not distinguish himself militarily, but proved himself to be <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> administrator.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period. He had a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E

40|$|Peer {{feedback}} {{content is}} a core component of peer assessment, but {{the impact of}} various contents of feedback is hardly studied. Participants {{in the study were}} 89 graduate students who were assigned to four experimental and a control group. Experimental groups received a scenario with Concise General (CGF) or Elaborated Specific (ESF) feedback by a high or low competent peer. ESF by <b>a</b> high <b>competent</b> peer was perceived as more adequate, but led to more negative affect. Students in CGF groups outperformed ESF groups during treatment. Groups with <b>a</b> low <b>competent</b> peer outperformed groups with <b>a</b> high <b>competent</b> peer during the posttest. Feedback perceptions and performance were uncorrelated. ([URL]...|$|R

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|In May 1933, Galland {{was ordered}} to a meeting in Berlin as one of 12 {{civilian}} pilots among 70 airmen who came from clandestine programmes, meeting Hermann Göring for the first time. Galland was impressed by and believed Göring to be <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> leader. In July 1933, Galland travelled to Italy to train with the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force). Initially the Germans were treated as inferior by the Italians, but after Galland had flown some daring and impressive low-level manoeuvres, the German contingent won their hosts' respect.|$|E
5|$|Lilly {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} {{commanding}} officer of his battery from August 1862 until the winter of 1863, when his three-year enlistment expired. His only prior military experience had been in a Lafayette, Indiana, militia unit. Several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command; however, despite his initial inexperience, Lilly became <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> artillery officer. His battery was instrumental in several important battles, including the Battle of Hoover's Gap in June 1863 and in the Second Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.|$|E

5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> official. These aspects of his life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, {{formerly}} of the St. Louis Blues, {{to serve as the}} team's general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team's head coach. The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> roster, but one that was young and inexperienced. Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> and professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than other female gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes that players receive as rewards for completing certain tasks within the games.|$|E

The organism was clearly <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as <b>a</b> <b>competent,</b> if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, {{and that the only}} outstanding task was a final review by <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by <b>a</b> <b>competent</b> scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.|$|E
