40|$|ABSTRACT External {{cervical}} resorption is caused, almost exclusively, by dental trauma - {{especially those}} characterized by concussion - {{and is a}} dental disease to be diagnosed and treated accurately by endodontists. However, {{the vast majority of}} the cases is initially diagnosed by an orthodontist, due to the imaging possibilities in standardized documentations. Among the causes of external cervical resorption, it is common to mistakenly attribute it to orthodontic treatment, traumatic occlusion or even to chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. External cervical resorption is associated to dental trauma in several situations mentioned in this paper. In old cases, and eventually still nowadays, it may have been induced by internal tooth bleaching, which is increasingly less frequent in endodontically treated teeth. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>tips</b> to be followed and some care that must be taken during the diagnosis and treatment of external cervical resorption clinical cases.

Calves not receiving adequate colostrum will be at risk for disease until their own immunity can ramp up by approximately 2 to 3 months of age.
