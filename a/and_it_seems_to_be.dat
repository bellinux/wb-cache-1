25|$|The {{use of a}} seal by men {{of wealth}} and {{position}} was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit. An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to Victorinus) indicates that he used a seal. The practice spread, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken for granted by King Clovis I {{at the very beginning}} of the Merovingian dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the highest}} {{cortisol}} secretion {{happens in the}} second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the ﬁrst half of the night. Cortisol awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked specifically to the event of awakening.|$|E
500|$|A fourth-season episode, [...] "Dunder Mifflin Infinity", {{said the}} company was founded in 1949 by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin, {{originally}} to sell brackets for use in construction. The fifth-season episode [...] "Company Picnic" [...] said that the co-founders met {{on a tour of}} Dartmouth College. U.S. News and World Report likens it to many real companies in its size range: [...] "It is facing an increasingly competitive marketplace. Like many smaller players, it just can't compete with the low prices charged by big-box rivals like Staples, OfficeMax and Office Depot, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constantly bleeding corporate customers that are focused on cutting costs themselves." [...] The show's creators share this assessment—"It's basically a Staples, just not as big", says co-producer Kent Zbornak—as do some of those companies. [...] "Since Dunder Mifflin could be considered among our competitors", says Chuck Rubin, an Office Depot executive, [...] "I think Michael Scott is actually the perfect person to run their Scranton office." ...|$|E

60|$|Again he stopped, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> us {{watching}} that he smiled a little.|$|R

2500|$|For example, {{the words}} of [...] "I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day" [...] (Roud 975) are known from a {{broadside}} in the Bodleian Library. The date is almost certainly before 1900, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler Jeannie Robertson from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to [...] "Jock Stewart", one of her relatives, {{and there are no}} Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist Archie Fisher deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 The Pogues took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{agree about}} {{everything}} now. He has altogether disarmed papa's prejudices, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recognised {{that he is}} to have his own way about the place. But I don't think he'll interfere about the shooting." ...|$|E

50|$|Material of {{this species}} has been dated to 750-2850 years before present, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been widely {{distributed}} throughout Madagascar. It was estimated to have gone extinct c.1200 AD. However remains with disputed dating have suggested that some survived up until at least 1500 AD, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have survived a considerable time in coexistence with humans, before it finally died out.|$|R
60|$|Still he stood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{her that}} her father's gaze pierced to her secret soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the newspapers, like hogs {{swimming}} too freely, {{have cut}} their own throats; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fashionable, just at this moment, {{not to believe}} them. Lecturing is the great moral lever of the nation at present." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it is only}} {{in these}} ecstasies of the senses that the soul ever reaches self-consciousness on earth; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only the man-soul which finds itself even in this abandon. The woman-soul has always {{something}} else to think of.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} that," [...] remarked Lodloe; [...] "in fact I {{know very little about}} the place. I have heard it spoken of, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just the quiet, restful place in which I can work. I am a {{literary}} man, and like to work in the country." ...|$|E
60|$|A cañon night-hawk voiced his lonely, weird, and melancholy cry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pierce <b>and</b> {{mark the}} silence.|$|R

6000|$|... "It don't seem 'zactly {{right to}} ask a lady to do the fightin'," [...] remarked Cap'n Bill, [...] "but magic ain't my strong p'int, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> yours, ma'am. So swim ahead, and we'll wiggle {{the same way you}} do, an' try to wiggle out of our troubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, yes. They are two dancing {{girls at}} the Opera, sisters, as {{different}} from each other as I and our poor Rita. But they are both virtuous and that gentleman, their father, is very severe with them. Very severe indeed, poor motherless things. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> such a sinful occupation.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll have one." [...] He lit up, {{taking a}} deep breath. [...] "You see, {{we have a problem}} at the Garrison. Something has been {{happening}} to some of the men, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spreading. We have to find out what causes it or we won't be able to run the Garrison." ...|$|E

60|$|Virginia <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> find speech impossible, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{him that}} he could see the tears {{gathering}} in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her white, drawn face, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me I might carry her yet. I spluttered for words.|$|R
60|$|There {{is no more}} delusive passion than hope; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the happy}} {{privilege}} of youth to cull all the pleasures that can be gathered from its indulgence. It is when we are most worthy of confidence ourselves, that we are least apt to distrust others; and what we think ought to be, we are prone to think will be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I would tell you a {{falsehood}} about it? What I meant was {{that it is a}} kind of thing one doesn't like talking about, merely because stories are bandied about. People are so fond of saying that this man is engaged to that woman, and of making up tales; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so foolish to contradict such things." ...|$|E
60|$|Ingratitude is {{generally}} supposed the vice peculiar to republics; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgotten that for one instance of popular inconstancy, {{we have a}} hundred examples {{of the fall of}} courtly favourites. Besides, a people have often repented--a monarch seldom or never. Leaving apart many familiar proofs of this fact, a short story may show the difference between even an aristocracy and the multitude.|$|E
60|$|It is man's nature <b>to</b> soar intellectually, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} his {{ambition}} from earliest ages to soar physically.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the longest}} speech I had ever heard the man make, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> impress Bill. He was quite humble.|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} the feeling of an American, divided, as I am, by the ocean from his country, has a continual and {{immediate}} correspondence with the national feeling at home; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent of any external communication. Thus, my ideas about the Russian war vary {{in accordance with the}} state of the public mind at home, so that I am conscious whereabouts public sympathy is.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{would much}} rather not, captain. I only came for a cruise, {{and it has been}} a splendid one; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite absurd that I should be getting {{anything}} at all. Still, it will be jolly, because I shall be able to make Carrie and Gerald nice presents, with my own money; and to send some home to Mr. Medlin and his family, and something to uncle, too, if I can think of anything he would like." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{would be}} sorry {{to take any}} portion of the {{sculpture}} from the collection in the British Museum, and to associate it with any collection of painting?--Yes, I should think it highly inexpedient. My whole object would be {{that it might be}} associated with a larger collection, a collection from other periods, and not be subdivided. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the chief reasons advanced in order to justify removing that collection, that it cannot be much more enlarged--that you cannot at present put other sculpture with it.|$|E
