Method. The qualitative analysis was done on the basis of the sequence of the uncertainty and certainty and the topic <b>and</b> <b>comment</b> in the user's utterances during the interaction in order to explore the use of these elements.

Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc Ràfols, Joan Bergós, Cèsar Martinell and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaudí left {{is known as the}} Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873–1878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject. Included are an analysis of the Christian church and of his ancestral home, as well as a text about ornamentation <b>and</b> <b>comments</b> on the design of a desk.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume.

5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions <b>and</b> <b>comments</b> and even alleged that these actions were {{connected}} with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
