5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E

These are abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects. Each language may have subtly different rules on how to use demonstratives to refer <b>to</b> things previously <b>spoken,</b> currently being <b>spoken,</b> or <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be <b>spoken.</b> In English, that (or occasionally those) refers <b>to</b> something previously <b>spoken,</b> while this (or occasionally these) refers <b>to</b> something <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> (or, occasionally, something being simultaneously spoken).|$|R
