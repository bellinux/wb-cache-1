In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E

5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April.

They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition.
