500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} painting was set in a barbershop with patrons {{of a variety of}} religions and races <b>all</b> <b>waiting</b> their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a [...] oil on canvas depicting tolerance as [...] "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.|$|E
500|$|Country singer Taylor Swift {{performed}} the song on her Speak Now World Tour on September 20, 2011 located in Louisiana, {{as a tribute}} to Spears. Wearing her signature lilac dress, Swift started to play the first chords of [...] "Lucky" [...] on her guitar, while singing, [...] "Early morning/She wakes up/With a knock, knock, knock on the [...] door/It's time for makeup/Perfect smile/It's you they're <b>all</b> <b>waiting</b> for." [...] Scott Shetler of Pop Crush said that [...] "the crowd energy for the Britney cover didn't seem as high as when Swift covered Eminem in Detroit or Justin Bieber in Toronto." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, however, praised the performance, and noted that the show's crowd gave a positive reaction to the cover, saying, [...] "though the video is sideways and features the amateur videographer's own personal sing-along, the excitement in her voice is a testament to Taylor's song choice. Or in other words, we can almost guarantee that every normal, living, breathing Louisiana-bred girl in attendance at Taylor's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song, but was surprised that the song Swift chose was [...] "Lucky". PopDust writer Katherine St Asaph said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is [...] "one of the few Britney lyrics that could just as easily be written for/by Taylor {{and one of the few}} songs that wouldn’t need massive re-arranging." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haneef's family {{celebrated his}} release. [...] "We've {{always known that}} he was {{innocent}} and now everyone else knows it too," [...] Haneef's sister, Sumayya said. [...] "It's been a year since we've last seen him and this last month has been so traumatic for us. We're <b>all</b> <b>waiting</b> to finally meet him. My brother has suffered so much this past month." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... and in {{less than}} a week now, I get the eye sliced up. And I know it'll be a success. Pray for me at 4pm on the tenth, will you. So here's hoping that when they take the {{bandages}} off on about the 20th, my eye will function… Ah just ain't got the dough for the hospital on the tenth. If can't get it - well, then no operation as can't ask the doctor to actually fork out money for me in addition. So, sister, please see what you can do in addition to the usual ten-spot, will you please? And let me have it by Wednesday.” [...] a group of Chinese saw me today and want to take lessons from me and will even pay for a ship as soon as the eye is okay. Private flying, govt. jobs, city and state jobs - <b>all</b> <b>waiting.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{first years}} of {{operations}} saw limited ridership. The line had few direct ramps into malls and lacked escalators. Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of Siam Paragon Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand's most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system's central Siam station. The redevelopment of the Ratchaprasong and Siam districts {{as well as new}} [...] "skywalks" [...] fostered growing accessibility. Ridership continued to increase with incremental expansion of the line, from 529,466 weekday passengers in 2011 to 573,041 in January 2012, to 668,302 in August 2013, surpassing 600,000 passengers daily for all of August. [...] Nowadays at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take <b>all</b> <b>waiting</b> passengers. The total number of passenger trips made between 12 May 1999 and 25 September 2013 was 1,794,280,399. [...] Political unrest in Bangkok led to an all-time high Sunday ridership of 760,000, while the subway also hit record highs.|$|E
2500|$|One {{battalion}} commander unilaterally cancelled the attack before the order arrived and of twenty men who crossed the parapet on the left, [...] {{shot down by}} machine-gun fire or shrapnel in [...] On the right, the acting commander of the 1/5th South Staffordshire was wounded just before zero and giving no signal, no-one moved, <b>all</b> <b>waiting</b> {{for someone else to}} give the order. The commander of the 1/5th North Staffordshire, seeing no movement, stopped the advance and waited on events. Snow, the corps commander, had heard that the 56th (1st London) Division had been repulsed, ordered the 137th Brigade attack to be cancelled, which arrived just in time, since the British re-bombardment from [...] and the new smoke barrage had alerted the Germans who placed another standing barrage in no man's land. With smoke obscuration, a [...] rush might have succeeded but the [...] distance was impossible. None of the 1/5th and 1/7th Sherwood Foresters who got into the German defences came back but a few trickled back from shell-holes after dark, the battalions losing about 80 percent casualties, including both commanders killed.|$|E
