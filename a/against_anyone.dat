5|$|Chapters 5 and 6 {{discuss the}} means of {{cleansing}} the body and mind. The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self-restraints (Yamas), observances (Niyamas), avoiding anger <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> or anything, truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru (teacher), and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for rewards of one's action.|$|E
5|$|The new ACC commander, General Corley, {{referred}} {{the matter}} to USAF Lieutenant General Norman Seip, commander of the 12th Air Force, as a court-martial convening authority to determine if additional charges or actions would be taken against any of the personnel involved in the incident. Seip later closed the investigation without recommending criminal charges <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> involved.|$|E
5|$|In the 1760s, the British Parliament's {{passage of}} the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, {{combined}} with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against England in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the Tea Act in 1773, there were threats <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> who would store tea and any ships that brought tea up the Delaware. After the Boston Tea Party, a shipment of tea had arrived in December, on the ship the Polly. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.|$|E
50|$|Chi-Chung {{continues}} to have ups and downs in fame and fortune. With love as well, he encounters frustration and defeat. Something that is <b>against</b> <b>anyone’s</b> wishes happens to Ching-Chuen, which causes the relationship among Chi-Chung, Tsi-Wah, and Ching-Chuen {{to make a new}} progression.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Against</b> <b>anyone's</b> {{expectations}} Doe Maar played eight {{shows in}} 2008 with Joost as the fifth man; four club dates (June), a three-night residency at Rotterdam's Feijenoord Stadium (July 11, 12, 13), and a performance at Belgium's brand new Werchter Boutique-festival. Henny was quoted [...] "This {{is not a}} reunion, we're back together".|$|R
5000|$|Cardinal George rebuked Pfleger, saying, [...] "Publicly {{delivering}} a threat <b>against</b> <b>anyone's</b> life betrays the civil order and is morally outrageous, especially if this threat {{came from a}} priest." [...] Pfleger claimed {{that he did not}} intend to use the word [...] "snuff" [...] as a slang term for [...] "kill", but rather as a substitute for [...] "pull", as he used later in his statement.|$|R

Misa freely possess her at any time, represented by a change in Yusa's eye and hair color. While possessing Yusa, Misa is able to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Misa has a tomboyish and ill-tempered personality, and she is not afraid to be violent <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> looking to harm her sister. She disappears after Yuu takes away Yusa's power.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont, seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont. Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> involved.|$|E
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E

5|$|Odex's {{actions against}} file sharing were legal actions against Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their {{subscribers}} in Singapore by Odex, a Singapore-based company that virtually distributes sub-licensed Japanese anime. From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> who had downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas {{to compel the}} ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. More {{than a third of}} the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E
5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Austria has {{legislation}} in place which makes hate speech <b>against</b> <b>anyone's</b> race, religion, nationality or ethnicity illegal. Laws like this, which discourage discrimination, {{are able to}} help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups and subsequently {{reducing the number of}} racially-motivated incidents of police brutality. Along with these efforts, Austria has a number of NGOs who are trying to implement programs which encourage positive cross-cultural relations, and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. The Austrian police are also trying to find their own ways to prevent police brutality and to make the prosecution of police misconduct a smoother process.|$|R

25|$|The Mafia's {{power comes}} from its {{reputation}} to commit violence, particularly murder, <b>against</b> virtually <b>anyone.</b> Through reputation, mafiosi deter their enemies and enemies of their clients. It allows mafiosi {{to protect a}} client without being physically present (e.g. as bodyguards or watchmen), which in turn allows them to protect many clients at once.|$|R
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2012, the {{government}} banned all protests, threatening legal action <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> {{who attempted to}} organize a rally or demonstration.

50|$|Danvers-Walker {{wanted to}} join the BBC {{as soon as the}} war started, but was {{prevented}} by a BBC rule <b>against</b> employing <b>anyone</b> who had worked on commercial radio.

25|$|A {{player of}} great athleticism and endurance, {{he had a}} {{distinctive}} style and appearance—bowlegged and very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed Jimmy Connors in using the two-handed backhand. By {{the time he was}} 13 he was beating the best of Sweden's under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain Lennart Bergelin (who served as Borg's primary coach throughout his professional career) cautioned <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> trying to change Borg's rough-looking, jerky strokes.|$|E

Her favorite hobby is belittling her lonely and sexless brother, though she stands up for him <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> outside the family.|$|E
25|$|The next {{session of}} the Council took place on 10 July, with the Pope again presiding. The {{embassies}} of Florence and Siena presented their congratulations and announced their adherence. Through Cardinal de Challant the Pope announced that all penal sentences which had been levelled <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> by either Gregory XII or Benedict XIII were declared null and void. Another session was scheduled for Monday 15 July, but it was postponed until the 27th at the Pope's request, due {{to the arrival of}} Louis of Anjou, the pretender to the throne of Naples.|$|E

Above all else, Ryan strives to keep Cyril in Emerald City, where Ryan can protect him. Cyril in turn cares about Ryan and depends on him a great deal, usually obeying him, which leads to Ryan taking advantage of him more than once.|$|R

5000|$|On Tennyson's death {{there was}} a {{considerable}} feeling {{that there was no}} acceptable successor, William Morris and Swinburne being hardly suitable as court poets. Eventually the undesirability of breaking with tradition for temporary reasons, severing the one official link between literature and the state, prevailed over the protests <b>against</b> allowing <b>anyone</b> of inferior genius to follow Tennyson. Abolition had been similarly advocated when Warton and Wordsworth died. Edward Gibbon had condemned the position's artificial approach to poetry: ...|$|R

25|$|IWF {{filtering}} {{has been}} criticised as interfering with legitimate Internet activity while being ineffective <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> intending to access objectionable content. One carefully argued discussion, while opposing {{such things as}} child pornography and terrorism, points out that filtering has side effects, as discussed in this section, and would not stop access to material such as images {{of child sexual abuse}} as it would not stop email, ftp, https, p2p, usenet, irc, or many other ways to access the same content. As there are simple encryption systems, it never can stop it - at best it just drives it underground and harder to assess and track.|$|E
25|$|Plans to {{evacuate}} the ethnic German population westward into Germany, from Poland and the eastern territories of Germany, were prepared by various Nazi authorities {{toward the end of}} the war. In most cases implementation was delayed until Soviet and Allied forces had defeated the German forces and advanced into the areas to be evacuated. The abandonment of millions of ethnic Germans in these vulnerable areas until combat conditions overwhelmed them can be attributed directly to the measures taken by the Nazis <b>against</b> <b>anyone</b> suspected of 'defeatist' attitudes (as evacuation was considered) and the fanaticism of many Nazi functionaries in their execution of Hitler's 'no retreat' orders.|$|E
