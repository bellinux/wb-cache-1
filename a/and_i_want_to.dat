These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience that with my fans.|$|E

500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Another important concept pioneered by Kraft {{was the idea}} of the flight director, the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission.

[...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E

My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> express it.|$|E
