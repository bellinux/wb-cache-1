25|$|The {{cost factor}} {{tends to make}} {{cremation}} attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost {{include the use of}} different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.|$|E

Zhdanov asks com. Dange to explain why the Congress managed to strengthen its authority.Comrade Dange opines that during the war the Congress, taking into account the anti-English sentiments of the wide masses, opposed the English and by this action acquired a semblance of a national organisation fighting for the national sovereignty.The Communist Party during the war supported the allies, including the English and by this action weakened its influence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people could not correctly understand the position of the Party. A considerable part of the supporters of the Communist Party during the war shifted to the Congress.|$|E
500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does strike you <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5. [...] On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, [...] "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{the scene}} with the burning camp was [...] "tricky", {{according}} to Kim Manners. When they were filming the scene, they had huge [...] "safety precautions" [...] ready for the cast and crew. The fires seen in the episode, were in reality propane fires. Manners wanted the shots to be {{as close to the}} fire as possible, so they used fireproof cameras. According to Manners, [...] "they used a half a million dollar camera on a crane wrapped in asbestos" [...] and ran it through the flames. For the following scene, the production crew set a man on fire, while using a fire suit. This stunt is known as [...] a [...] "full burn." [...] Scenes like this are [...] "very dangerous" [...] as one can't breathe. In total, he was on fire between 25–30 seconds, which is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> by filming standards. Special effects supervisor Tony Lindala supervised the creation of the faceless alien rebels, Dmitri's mutilation, and the incinerated victims of the rebels.

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Cecotto's driving {{which caused}} the multi-car pileup in the feature race {{received}} much attention. It was third such {{incident in the}} season when Cecotto courted controversy and criticism from drivers: he was disqualified from qualifying for the Sepang round when he forced Bird off the track but avoided being issued with a penalty in the Catalunya sprint race when he swerved into Canamasas during a battle for fifth position. Leimer claimed that Cecotto solely concentrated on him rather than making the corner, [...] "It's really, really disappointing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> was possible today and I could have scored a lot of points. But once more due to another driver I lost out, while my competitors {{in the battle for}} the championship are scoring." [...] Palmer was more vocal in his criticism in Cecotto, remarking he would rather start from the pit lane than within two rows of Cecotto. Peter Allen of Formula Scout argued that while Cecotto's manoeuvre was not clearly malicious in intent, the Venezuelan deserved the race ban and that it would help him realise that he needed to control his aggressiveness.|$|E

500|$|However, Frusciante was not {{familiar}} with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." [...] Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired. Soon after, Chad Smith was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's Mother's Milk. Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records. Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer's much greater knowledge of the studio. Kiedis recalls that [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of folks her age do... It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{week after}} the {{official}} opening of the ride at Cedar Point, attraction reviewer Brian Krosnick of Theme Park Tourist submitted an online review {{saying that it was}} [...] "truly breathtaking". The review applauded [...] "the inclusion of on-ride audio and such an exemplary lighting package", commenting that it was [...] "more than anyone expected or could've asked for". Krosnick pointed out that, because of the location of the ride beside Lake Erie and the hot summers, the lights on the ride attract massive [...] "clouds" [...] of bugs. He felt the ride cycle might be too short for the type of ride, particularly the time spent at the top. On July 13, 2011, Nick Sim, also from Theme Park Tourist, reviewed the ride at Kings Island and made similar remarks. Los Angeles Times blogger Brady MacDonald complimented the [...] "impressive nighttime spectacular from anywhere in the park". He reported having thoroughly enjoyed the ride at Knott's Berry Farm and said that he would ride it every time he visited the park. Tom Sherer of the Sandusky Register praised Cedar Point's WindSeeker for having one of the best views of the park and commented that it [...] "isn't as extreme <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people fear, unless you’re afraid of heights." [...] He criticized the name WindSeeker, pointing out that the ride closes in high winds. Another reviewer called the view from Knott's Berry Farm's version [...] "simply breathtaking" [...] and urged readers to [...] "get a ride on it as soon as you can". The same reviewer, however, also criticized the choice of music, suggesting that the park should have used [...] "themes from more 'southwestern' films" [...] to fit with the overall theme of the Fiesta Village area. Members of the general public have also applauded the addition.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Middle Ages {{until the}} end of World War II, Germany was usually the country outside Scandinavia having the closest cultural, {{commercial}} and political relations with Sweden.
