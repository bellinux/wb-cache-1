Leaching tests used were two regulatory tests, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and the Australian Bottle Leaching Procedure (ABLP), as well as column leaching. Arsenic leachate concentrations from cement-stabilized lead arsenate insecticide were similar when subjected to either the TCLP or ABLP using the same leachant. Lead, known to be immobilized by means different to that of arsenic, yielded varying leachate concentrations when using either of the regulatory tests, even though the leachant was of the same type. The leaching of calcium influences the filtered arsenic leachate, whereas the leaching of lead is greatly affected by leachate pH. As expected, both regulatory tests generally proved to be very severe in terms of the masses of the hazardous constituents leached when compared to conceptually more realistic column leaching scenarios. Sodium arsenate-containing formulations behaved anomalously, with column leaching tests resulting in larger arsenic masses being leached than the regulatory tests.

50|$|Ghana’s Obuasi {{region is}} known to host arsenopyritic goldbearing ore bodies. According to company reports, during the 1990s, an arsenic {{precipitation}} plant was installed at the Pompora Treatment Plant for the commercial recovery of arsenic from the roaster flue gases. At the time, the recovered arsenic trioxide was sold to Europe for commercial applications. As the market for arsenic declined, the treatment plant was shut down in 2000 and about 10,000 metric tons (t) of arsenic was stockpiled in bags at Obuasi. After {{the introduction of the}} Biox treatment process, the arsenic trioxide was converted to <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and deposited in tailings dams. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (the company that was formed through the merger of Ashanti Goldfields Ltd. and AngloGold Ltd.) reported that inadequate storage of the stockpiled bags allegedly caused arsenic contamination to the Pompora stream. The problem was identified during the company’s due diligence study prior to the merger. AngloGold Ashanti constructed a lined storage dam at the old heap leach site. The company planned to move the arsenic to a new facility where it will be stored and gradually disposed of by blending it into the Biox process circuit where it will be chemically stabilized and deposited as a component of the tailings residue in the new Sansu Tailings Storage Facility. The company estimates that it will take about 6 years to dispose of the arsenic.|$|E

HPLC fingerprintings were constructed for quality control of the Radix Rubiae extract using mollugin as the chemical marker. Further phytochemical study found that ethyl acetate fraction of this herb possessed potent growth inhibition on HaCaT cells, with IC 50 of 0. 9 microg/ml. However, the chemical compounds obtained from commercial sources including mollugin, alizarin, purpurin, and quinizarin failed to induce growth inhibition. Meanwhile, arsenic trioxide, <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and arsenic iodide, three arsenic salts presented in realgar, had significant anti-proliferative effect on HaCaT cells, with IC 50 values of 2. 4, 16 and 6. 8 microM, respectively; and cellular apoptosis {{was found to be}} the underlying mechanism for the observed growth inhibitory activity. Furthermore, Radix Rubiae, realgar and arsenic compounds were also revealed to possess growth inhibition when evaluated in a PHA-activated PBMC model, and all of the substances except <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide</b> significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-y, TNF-alpha and IL- 2 in PBMC, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. The in vivo mouse tail model experiments demonstrated that arsenic trioxide, <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and arsenic iodide were able to markedly induce mouse tail keratinocyte differentiation, while such differentiation-modulating effect observed in the fraction of Radix Rubiae was only marginal. In summary, Radix Rubiae and realgar extracts and three arsenic compounds have been identified and characterized as potential anti-psoriatic agents. The discoveries from the present PhD project not only help put the traditional use of these medicinal substances for psoriasis treatment on a scientific footing, but also open up new opportunities for their development into novel anti-psoriatic therapies. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting approximately 2 - 3 % of the population worldwide, is characterized histologically by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Many conventional therapies are offered for psoriasis treatment but there exist problems such as unsatisfactory efficacy, side effects and drug resistance. Many patients therefore turn to alternative and complementary medicines for help. Traditionally, Chinese herbal medicine has been extensively used to treat psoriasis and produced promising clinical results. The present PhD study was conducted to investigate psoriasis-treating Chinese herbal medicines with an aim to identify effective anti-psoriatic agents. Sixty Chinese medicinal materials were selected for the screening project based on their ethnomedical use in psoriasis. The ethanolic extracts of these medicinal substances were evaluated for their anti-proliferative action on cultured HaCaT human keratinocytes using microplate SRB and MTT assays. Among them, the root of Rubia cordifolia L. (Radix Rubiae) and realgar were found to have significant anti-proliferative effects, with IC 50 values of 1. 4 and 6. 6 microg/ml, respectively as measured by MTT assay, while they exerted mild significant cytotoxicity on the human fibroblast Hs- 68 cell line.

CCA contaminated wood contains around 1 - 5 % of metal in form of <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> hexavalent and trivalent chromium compounds and copper sulfate, which act as fungicides and insecticides throughout the life of the wood. While CCA treatment is gradually becoming a banned practice, approximately 4 million tonnes of CCA treated wood is generated in the EU per year, which is set to continue for many decades as the in-service wood is generated in end of its life. Recycling wood waste is important for the effective utilization of natural resources. The charcoal product resulting from CCA treated wood contains Cu, Cr and As. The metals appear as both agglomerates and diffused in the solid matrix. Moreover, during pyrolysis an agglomeration process takes place, which induces not only the growth of existing mineral agglomerates but also the formation of new agglomerates. The objective of the present work is the valorisation of CCA metals and charcoal from treated wood waste. The research aims at understanding and promoting experimentally, at different pyrolysis heating rates, the generation of charcoal with high specific surface area from pyrolysed treated wood waste...|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{physical}} and chemical properties of arsenic and arsenic compounds can be found in Table 1. 1, for further details please refer to IARC (1980). The list is not exhaustive, nor does it comprise necessarily the most commercially important arsenic-containing substances; rather, it indicates the range of arsenic compounds available. 1. 2 Chemical and physical properties of the agents Arsenic (atomic number, 33; relative atomic mass, 74. 92) has chemical and physical properties intermediate between a metal and a nonmetal, and {{is often referred to as}} a metalloid or semi-metal. It belongs to Group VA of the Periodic Table, and can exist in four oxidation states: – 3, 0, + 3, and + 5. Arsenite, As III, and arsenate, As V, are the predominant oxidation states under, respectively, reducing and oxygenated conditions (WHO, 2001; IARC, 2004). From a biological and toxicological perspective, there are three major groups of arsenic compounds:-inorganic arsenic compounds,-organic arsenic compounds, and-arsine gas. Of the inorganic arsenic compounds, arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenite and arsenic trichloride are the most common trivalent compounds, and <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> arsenic acid and arsenates (e. g. lead arsenate and calcium arsenate) are the most common pentavalent compounds. Common organic arsenic compounds include arsanilic acid, methylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid), and arsenobetaine (WHO, 2000). 1. 3 Use of the agents Arsenic and arsenic compounds have been produced and used commercially for centuries. Current and historical uses of arsenic include pharmaceuticals, wood preservatives, agricultural chemicals, and applications in the mining, metallurgical, glass-making, and semiconductor industries.

The structures were determined using single crystal studies, which revealed two- (I, II, V) and three-dimensional (III, IV, VI) structures for the uranium arsenates. The uranium atom, in these compounds, exhibits considerable variations in the coordination (6 to 9) that appears to have some correlation with the synthetic conditions. The water molecules in [C 2 N 2 H 10][(UO 2) F(HAsO 4) ](2 center dot) 4 H(2) O, II, could be reversibly removed, and the dehydrated phase, [C 2 N 2 H 10][(UO 2) F(HAsO 4) ](2), IIa, was also characterized using single crystal studies. The observation of many mineralogical structures in the present compounds suggests that the hydrothermal method could successfully replicate the geothermal conditions. As part of this study, we have observed autunite, Ca[(UO 2) (PO 4) ](2) (H 2 O) (11), metavauxite, [Fe(H 2 O) (6) ][Al(OH) (H 2 O) (PO 4) ](2), finarite, PbCU(SO 4) (OH) (2), and tancoite, LiNa 2 H[Al(PO 4) (2) (OH) ], structures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the thermal {{behaviour}} of pure arsenic oxides (As 2 O 5. aq and As 2 O 3) {{and the influence}} of the presence of reducing agents (glucose or activated carbon) on the thermal behaviour of the arsenic oxides are studied through thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The TG experiments with pure As 2 O 5. aq reveal that the reduction reaction As 2 O 5 [...] > AS(2) O(3) + O- 2 does not take place at temperatures lower than 500 degreesC. At higher temperatures decomposition is observed. Pure As 2 O 3, however, is already released at temperatures as low as 200 degreesC. This release is driven by temperature dependent vapour pressures. Comparing these results with earlier observations concerning the thermal behaviour of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood, suggests that wood, char and pyrolysis vapours form a reducing environment that influences the thermal behaviour of arsenic oxides. Therefore, the influence of the presence of reducing agents on the thermal behaviour of As 2 O 5. aq is studied. First, TG experiments are carried out with mixtures of As 2 O 5 and glucose. The TG and DTG curves of the Mixture are not a simple superposition of the curves of the two pure constituents. The interaction between As 2 O 5. aq and glucose results in a faster decomposition of <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide.</b> This effect is more pronounced if the purge gas nitrogen is mixed with oxygen. Second, TG experiments are performed with mixtures of As 2 O 5 and activated carbon. The presence of activated carbon also promotes the volatilisation of arsenic for temperatures higher than 300 degreesC, probably through its reducing action. Extrapolation of the thermal behaviour of these model compounds to the real situation of pyrolysis of CCA treated wood confirms the statement that the reduction of pentavalent arsenic to trivalent arsenic is favoured by the reducing environment, created by the presence of wood, char and pyrolysis vapours. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} found that the enzymatic {{digestion}} products of proteins cause a rapid proliferation of blood monocytes in vitro. Digestion mixtures having anywhere from 12 to 68 per cent of their nitrogen in the amino form possess this property. For continued proliferation, heparin plasma or serum must be repeatedly supplied with the digests. Without them, multiplication continues for only a few days, the coagulum in which the cells are embedded liquefies around the central fragment, and the cells disintegrate. The enzymatic digests exert a marked effect on the morphological appearance of the cells and finally cause them to agglutinate. The extent of this effect is determined by the degree of hydrolysis of the digest, its concentration, and the length of time the cells are cultivated in it. The morphological appearance of the cells is also somewhat influenced {{by the nature of the}} plasma or serum used with the digest. Digests having very little free amino nitrogen produce short, round, granular cells. Those more highly hydrolyzed produce large, long, slender forms. An increase in the concentration of the digest in the medium causes a shortening and broadening of the cell and an increase in its granulations. Therefore, even a highly hydrolyzed digest may, if concentrated, give cells resembling those in a lower concentration of a less hydrolyzed one. The digests have a cumulative effect on the cells, as the time of cultivation is extended. Therefore, cultivation for a long period in a dilute solution may give the same effect as a shorter time in a higher concentration. A different effect is obtained if plasma is used with the digest than if serum is used, even when the plasma and serum are taken from the same animal. The monocytes cultivated in serum and digest are generally shorter, broader, and more granular than those cultivated in heparin plasma and digest. They also contain more fat and have a greater tendency to digest the clot. Agglutination of the cells takes place more readily in highly hydrolyzed products than in those slightly hydrolyzed. It is hastened by increase in concentration of the digest in the medium. It occurs more readily at the periphery of the culture and sooner in serum and digest than in heparin plasma and digest. Completely hydrolyzed proteins and mixtures of pure amino acids do not produce effects at all comparable to those of the enzymatic digests either in their effect on the rate of cell proliferation or their action on the morphology of the cell. <b>Arsenic</b> <b>pentoxide</b> in dilutions from 1 : 20, 000 to 1 : 80, 000 is the only other agent known to bring about agglutinations of the monocytes when cultivated in vitro.

When the digests are removed from the medium and the cells cultivated in plasma and Tyrode solution, they very gradually revert to their original form...|$|E
