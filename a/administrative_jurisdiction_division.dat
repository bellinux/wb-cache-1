40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Seveso and Seveso II directive [1996], many Western European countries have the opportunity to demand installations processing hazardous materials to have a a private fire brigade. In the Netherlands, based on the Dutch company fire brigade decree certain companies can be compelled to have a private fire brigade [BZK, 1990]. The criteria for having a private fire brigade relate to the term ‘an extraordinary danger’. The municipality assigns companies to this end reckoning for the hazardous materials that are processed and the possible response of the public fire brigade in that area. ProRail is the organization in the Netherlands that manages the railway infrastructure. ProRail operates over more than 80 marshalling yards. Hazardous materials are processed at about 40 marshalling yards and therefore for about 40 marshalling yards a company fire brigade might be compulsory. In the Rotterdam harbor area, for several years, a (juridical) discussion has been going on between the Rotterdam municipality and ProRail concerning the marshalling yards in this area. In August 2007, this dispute was brought to the highest court for such affairs in the Netherlands, the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> <b>Division</b> of the Council of State...|$|E
