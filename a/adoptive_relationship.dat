The United States 2 ̆ 7 recent ratification of the Hague Convention exemplifies the difficulties of implementing Hague Convention standards and the changing relationships between itself and sending countries. Member countries of the Hague Convention are the sending countries most likely to realize positive changes in adoption relationships through the United States 2 ̆ 7 ratification. But, problems with non-members and members not abiding by Convention standards, namely Guatemala, frustrate the goals of the Hague Convention. However, the United States plans to continue <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> with non-member sending countries and plans to refuse those relationships with member countries not abiding by Convention standards. This Note argues <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> between member countries should continue with those members not abiding by Convention standards if relations are continued with non-member countries.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to develop a {{theoretical}} model that explains an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to adopt a child. Several factors are explored as possible determinants of willingness to adopt, including the importance of the biological tie in family relationships, the presence of pronatalist beliefs, attitudes toward adoptive parenthood as inferior to biological parenthood, and definitions of infertility as stigmatizing. Previous research asserts that kinship in American society is defined in biological terms, that American society is very pronatalist, that adoptive parenthood is viewed by the general public as inferior to biological parenthood, and that infertility is a stigmatizing trait. The sample consisted of 232 married individuals from a state university community in the Midwest who received a mail questionnaire that measures attitudes toward these different concepts, along with their willingness to adopt a child. The findings indicate that there is not overwhelming support for claims that American society is strongly pronatalist, that the biological tie is strongly emphasized in family relationships, and that infertility is very stigmatizing. The proximity to an <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationship</b> proved to be the strongest factor in determining willingness to adopt a child, followed by attitudes toward adoptive parenthood as inferior to biological parenthood and pronatalist beliefs. Variables that centered around the importance of the biological tie or genetic background did not have direct effects on willingness to adopt. Overall, the theoretical model only moderately explains willingness to adopt a child. Other factors that might account for this include fertility status, desired family size, timing of child bearing, and altruism. ...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 235 - 252. This {{investigation}} into adoption began in January 1986 in the Republic of South Africa. The {{aim was to}} understand adoption from the subjective viewpoint of adults who were adopted as infants or children. It {{was based on the}} working hypothesis that although adoption has universal qualities, there would also be regional, cultural and time-related differences affecting both the practice and experience of adoption. Appeals were made for respondents through three popular magazines, private welfare organisations, the Registrar of Adoption and by means of "snowball sampling". Questionnaires were subsequently posted country-wide between April and October 1986. The questionnaire contained 209 open- and closed-ended questions covering the period from adoption placement to adulthood. An eighty-eight percent response rate was obtained. The material was analysed with emphasis on the qualitative interpretation of the content of the data in the open-ended responses. The sample comprised eighty-two adult adoptees between the ages of eighteen and seventy, of whom seventy-one percent were female, twenty-nine percent male, 58, 5 percent Afrikaans speaking and 41, 5 percent English- speaking. Cultural differences were found in the responses of the two language groups. Variables that have been considered relevant or insufficiently explored in the literature on adoption were examined. These were: age of placement; attachment in the adoptive home; manner and timing of revelation of adoptive status and adoptee reactions to this; adoptee thoughts and fears concerning birth parents, the school experience; identity problems in adolescence and adulthood manifested as insecurity or behaviour problems; the adoptee's need to know more about his or her origins and the concomitant consequences. Notable findings were: the paucity of information given to these adoptees about their origins; thoughts and fears about birth parents that occurred as early as the pre-school period; childhood fears arising from the adoptive status; sensitivity about being adopted; peer group cruelty in pre-puberty and a seventeen percent parasuicide incidence among the members of this sample. Another finding related to the adult adoptee's need for a bio-genealogical history, especially in view of the high risk of certain genetic disorders, particularly among the Afrikaner population. The majority of the adoptees in this sample entertained the possibility of meeting birth parents one day; for many this began in pre-puberty. This was contingent {{on the quality of the}} relationship with their adoptive parents in only a minority of cases. Few adoptees could share their thoughts about adoption and birth parents with their adoptive parents. Adoptees who were 'searching' or who had 'found' birth parents were motivated more by a need to know who they were and why they had been given up for adoption, than by a need to replace the 'lost parent'. Where the relationship with the adoptive parents was warm and satisfying, the finding of birth parent(s) did not affect the <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationship</b> deleteriously. These findings point to a need for more research on adoption following changes in South African adoption laws allowing adult adoptees access to court records of their adoption. Adoptees and their parents need informed assistance from those who counsel them...|$|E
5000|$|... "Dissatisfaction with {{adoptive parents}} was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} a motivating factor related to adoptees' searching (Sorosky, et al., 1975; Triseliotis, 1973). However, more recent research has found {{that the vast majority of}} adoptees who search have positive <b>relationships</b> with <b>adoptive</b> parents (Pacheco & Eme, 1993) or that the quality of <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> (either positive or negative) is not associated with a decision to search (Sachdev, 1993).... In fact, the most common reasons for searching given by adoptees are related to four themes: [...] "genealogical bewilderment" [...] (adoptees' need for historical connection to resolve identity issues); a need for information, a need to reduce stigma, and a desire to assure the parents of the adoptees' wellbeing" [...] (p. 38).|$|R
2500|$|Other studies provide {{evidence}} that <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes, [...] "...adoptive parents enrich their children's lives {{to compensate for the}} lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption." [...] Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because they favor them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help.|$|R
2500|$|The {{biological}} {{relationship between}} a parent and child is important, and {{the separation of the}} two has led to concerns about adoption. The traditional view of adoptive parenting received empirical support from a Princeton University study of 6,000 adoptive, step, and foster families in the United States and South Africa from 1968 to 1985; the study indicated that food expenditures in households with mothers of non-biological children (when controlled for income, household size, hours worked, age, etc.) were significantly less for adoptees, step-children, and foster children, causing the researchers to speculate that, instinctively, people are less interested in sustaining the genetic lines of others. [...] This theory is supported in another more qualitative study where in <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> marked by sameness in likes, personality, and appearance, both adult adoptees and adoptive parents report being happier with the adoption.|$|R

The subject isdealt with in light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights “ECtHR” as it has recently developed with regard to Art. 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which, as it is well known, enshrines the right to family life. According to the ECtHR’s case-law, a violation of Art. 8 of the Convention may be ascertained when personal status legally and stably constituted abroad are denied transnational continuity. Thus, on the basis of said ECtHR jurisprudence, this paper raises some questions (and tries to provide for the related answers) with regard to the consistency therewith of the conditions that familial relationships created abroad must satisfy when their recognition is sought pursuant to the relevant provisions currently applicable within the Italian legal system...|$|R
40|$|Openness in {{adoption}} practice now often includes post-adoption {{contact with}} the adopted child's birth family. Traditionally, indirect and direct contact has been supported and mediated by professionals following the adoption of children from the public care system in the UK. However, more recently, the widespread growth {{in the use of}} digital technologies has made it possible for both adopted children and birth relatives to search and contact one another through the use of sites such as Facebook without professional support. This practice has been called ‘virtual contact’. Using data from interviews with 11 adoptive parents and 6 adopted young people, who had experienced virtual contact, it is suggested that virtual contact works well when it is successfully integrated with the maintenance of more traditional methods of contact but can present risks when introduced without prior contact. Implications for practice are discussed in terms of how virtual contact can become a positive addition to adoption practices by utilising integrated methods of openness through which <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships</b> can be maintained...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the lens}} of {{hospitality}} to explore the creative potential of <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships,</b> James L. Gritter offers a congenial yet challenging depiction of adoption. In his hands, hospitality becomes {{the next phase of}} open adoption. The hospitious perspective encourages families to forge meaningful, dynamic, and enduring connections. And with its insight that each participant will play the role of guest and host as an adoption matures, hospitality enables us to see the children of adoption in a bold new way—as emerging hosts. With case studies from the author’s experience, Hospitious Adoption consid-ers each step of the process. The book also carefully examines potential barriers to hospitality: an expectant parent’s decision to discontinue a proposed adoption, a pairing of very different birthparents and adoptive parents, an adoptive fam-ily’s concern about privacy, an agency’s worry about efficiency. Drawing on his personal perspective, Gritter discusses the link between hospitality and faith. With its power to bring people together and to help children feel “at home, ” hos-pitality offers an encouraging way forward. James L. Gritter {{is also the author of}} The Spirit of Open Adoption and Lifegivers for CWLA Press. “Hospitious Adoption brings the adoption journey into the familiar world of relationships and the ingredients that allow them to blossom. Setting a valuable standard, it offers guidelines for a healthier journey for all involved. Written with clarity and thoughtful candor, it truly joins all partici-pants as valued, blended family members. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{representation}} of all-female family bonds in Virgil’s "Aeneid", Ovid’s "Metamorphoses", Valerius Flaccus’ "Argonautica" and Statius’ "Thebaid". The themes of sisterly unanimity, love and marriage, loss and mourning, and storytelling, provide the framework within which I investigate the literary models in epic, tragedy and other genres, of each episode featuring all-female interaction. Furthermore, I demonstrate how the Roman ideal of unanimity is combined with the Apollonian representation of Medea and Chalciope in the portrayal of Dido and Anna in Virgil, which then provides the basis for four often more extreme pairs of unanimae sorores in Latin epic. The final one in the series, consisting of the sisters-in-law Argia and Antigone, attests to a very Roman view {{about the power of}} <b>adoptive</b> <b>relationships.</b> In the same vein, the stories of Amata and Lavinia, and Ceres and Proserpina, are constructed around the Roman mother’s expectations of her role in her daughter’s marriage, while love stories including sisterly interference characterised by envy can be compared to specific examples of legendary Roman women. Roman mourning practices are present in all instances of heroines losing a mother, daughter or sister, and a specific analogy to the lament for Marcellus is identified in the Ovidian myth of Clymene and the Heliades. The suicide of Ismene after Jocasta’s similar death, on the other hand, corresponds {{to the idea of a}} Roman daughter following the example set by her mother taken to its limits. Finally, sister storytellers behave similarly to Roman matrons while the stories they tell are once again influenced by the interaction of Ovid’s contemporary women. Overall, I show how these epics can indirectly offer an insight into the lives of Roman women by modelling their mythical heroines both on literary tradition and on contemporary Roman ideals and practices.

50|$|There are {{researchers}} who disagree. If {{the quality of}} <b>adoptive</b> family <b>relationships</b> is sufficient to meet the child's emotional needs, knowledge of biological background should not equate good mental health; this in direct contrast {{to the concept of}} genealogical bewilderment. Adoptees with a need to search for their biological parents are often stigmatized as suffering from emotional deprivation as a result of poor <b>relationships</b> with their <b>adoptive</b> families. However, adoption reunion searches may stem from a variety of needs unrelated to the mental and emotional health and development of the adoptee. Among these may be the desire to reassert international citizenship rights as asserted and protected in the United Nations Charter on Human Rights; long-term health planning with respect to the advisability and utility of obtaining long-term biological family health histories; curiosity; and a sense of the personal and inalienable right to one's own identity, which begins with life.|$|R
40|$|Adoption {{has changed}} {{significantly}} {{over the last}} four decades, placing new demands on those affected by adoption, including adopters, adoptees and birth relatives (i. e. the ‘adoption triangle’), as well as the professionals involved. Over the same period, sociological theories relating to the family have developed considerably, yet their application to <b>adoptive</b> family <b>relationships</b> has been limited. This paper reports the findings of an in-depth narrative study of twenty-two parents who adopted children over a twenty-four-year period, linking their experiences to the sociological concepts of ‘family practices’ and ‘displaying family’. A common challenge shared by adoptive parents following domestic stranger adoption in an era of increasing openness was the requirement to create a new version of kinship that includes both adoptive relatives and birth relatives within the conceptual model of the adoptive family as well as the day-to-day ‘doing’ of family. The relevance of findings are explored in relation to adoptive family life, adoption practice and, specifically, post-adoption support services...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether adopted adolescents’ attachment to their adoptive parents predicted attachment experiences in close relationships outside one’s family during emerging adulthood. Data {{were taken from}} the Minnesota/Texas Adoption Research Project, a longitudinal study of 190 adoptive families followed for three time points (target adoptee’s childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood). Parental attachment was assessed through the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA: Armsden 2 ̆ 6 Greenberg, 1987), and hierarchical linear modeling allowed for calculations of the average and discrepancy of attachment to each adolescent’s parent dyad. Using the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR: Brennan, Clark, 2 ̆ 6 Shaver, 1998), attachment style in emerging adulthood was evaluated in terms of the level of avoidance and anxiety in close relationships. While avoidance in close relationships was predicted by dyadic parental attachment, anxiety was not. Congruent with expectations, less avoidance was associated with stronger parent dyad attachments. Additionally, older age appeared to predict less avoidance in close relationships.

The extent to which the courts have jurisdiction to regulate access will depend on the nature of the parents' relationship.

Emerging adulthood is a developmental {{period in which}} family relationships are important, yet research provides evidence that adoptive families have lower relationship quality compared to their nonadoptive counterparts. Despite some support for a relationship between adoption and adoptee-adoptive mother relationships during emerging adulthood, no systematic investigation has occurred. Utilizing self-report and observational data from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study, two studies employed hierarchical regression analyses to extend knowledge {{of the relationship between}} adoption and adoptee-adoptive mother relationships during emerging adulthood. Study 1 investigated the association between adoptee-reported adoption-related variables and the self-reported and observed relationships adoptees have with their adoptive mothers during emerging adulthood. Emerging adult adoptees who felt more positively about adoption had higher closeness and relationship quality and lower conflict with adoptive mothers. Additionally, transracial emerging adult adoptees were found to have lower conflict and higher <b>relationship</b> quality with <b>adoptive</b> mothers compared to inracial adoptees. Study 2 investigated the association between adoptive mother-reported adoption-related variables and the self-reported and observed <b>relationships</b> <b>adoptive</b> mothers have with their adopted children during emerging adulthood.

40|$|An adopted person {{develops}} a narrative or story {{to help make}} sense {{of his or her}} adoption. This narrative provides a window into how the adoptee understands the role of adoption in his or her life and articulates feelings and thoughts about it. Adolescent and emerging adult adoptees’ data from the Minnesota-Texas Adoption Research Project (MTARP) were examined. MTARP longitudinally followed 190 adoptive kinship networks, with varying levels of openness in the adoption, from childhood to emerging adulthood. The current study sought to understand how emotion (affective valence and specific emotions), as identified in the adoption narratives during adolescence and emerging adulthood, related to qualities of their closest emerging adult relationships. It was expected that reflections of early relationships would impact the current evaluation of relationships. The emotions described in these narratives were used to predict relationship qualities (attachment related anxiety and avoidance, relationship satisfaction, and intimacy maturity). It was expected that more positive affect and less negative affect would predict higher levels of attachment security, intimacy, and relationship satisfaction. The change in affect over time (from adolescence to emerging adulthood) and average affect over time were also examined. Specific emotions of affect were explored and evaluated for their contribution to emerging adulthood relationship qualities. Results indicated associations of both negative and positive affect with attachment style in emerging adulthood.

This <b>relationship</b> first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|R
