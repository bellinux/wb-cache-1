40|$|Following {{the death}} of cells, a number of {{previously}} inactive intracellular enzymes apparently become activated and bring about the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissues.</b> de Duve and his collaborators have presented evidence that such activation {{is due to the}} release of acid hydrolases from a heterogeneous group of particles called lysosomes (1). Within these granules, which sediment with the mitochondrial fraction of tissue homogenates prepared in sucrose, are found such enzymes as beta glucuronidase, acid phosphatase, acid DNAase and RNAase, the cathepsins, and other hydrolases having an acid pH optimum. The full activities of these enzymes may be released from lysosome-rich subcellular fractions by treatment with non-ionic detergents, by exposure to hypoosmolar conditions, or by repeated freezing and thawing. Recently, more "physiologic" means of releasing these potentially harmful enzymes from particles both in vitro and in vivo have been described, such as their exposure to an excess of vitamin A (2 - 4), irradiation with the mercury spectrum (5), or simple incubation at 37 °C at pH 5 (1) ...|$|E

When <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissues</b> takes place the amount of inhibitor is greatly increased. Fresh liver from beef, rabbit, and guinea pig is free of active inhibitor, although inhibitor is demonstrable in autolysates of this tissue. Fresh rabbit kidney is likewise free of active inhibitor. Following acid hydrolysis extracts of fresh rabbit liver and kidney cause sulfonamide inhibition. Normal human urine contains little or no active inhibitor. However, upon acid hydrolysis, inhibitor is uniformly present. Sulfonamide inhibitor is present in some, but not all, sterile serous effusions occurring during certain diseases. Inhibitor was found uniformly in pus. None was found in blood serum.

The parasite forms pseudocysts scattered throughout the striated epaxial and hypaxial muscles. Samples embedded in paraffin were analyzed histologically using hematoxylin-eosin, Gömöri, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Giemsa staining. Necropsy of the C. orbicularis specimens revealed that 100 % (50 / 50) were infected with K. orbicularis. The specimens presented grossly abnormal muscle texture, resulting in extensive inconsistencies and weakness. Progressive softening of the muscles was observed during necropsy, indicating the rapid enzymatic <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tissue.</b> The parasite found in the muscle <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> C. orbicularis was identified as K. orbicularis, with clinical signs of disease being observed in the fish.

These changes can be demonstrated readily in material obtained from dogs killed 2, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours after the initial radiation (Text-figs. 1 and 2). In the radiated dogs the secretory crypt epithelium of the small intestine autolyzes first and the epithelium of the villi last, while {{the reverse is true}} in the normal control small intestine.

40|$|Flowers are prized {{as objects}} of great beauty and diversity, and are commercially {{valuable}} (~US$ 4. 5 billion {{in international trade}} yearly) and highly perishable. Biologically, flower petals {{have an important role}} in the lifecycle of plants, as they protect immature reproductive structures, then provide the attraction and accessibility needed for pollination to occur. Flower petal cell wall construction, maintenance, and breakdown are important factors in the life of flowering plants as well as being related to the visual quality of commercial cut flowers. The petal is generally a thin structure, with a mesophyll-type cell layer between an ordered upper and lower epidermis. Petal cell walls are constructed in such a way as to be able to accommodate large and quite fast increases in cellular turgor during petal expansion and flower opening. There is some variety in the way the flower lifecycle may end once pollination has occurred, with petal wilting, shattering, abscission, almost complete <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> petal <b>tissue,</b> and the development of a papery shell all occurring in different species. The senescence of flower petals can be accompanied by increased activity of cell wall hydrolases, similar to that found during fruit ripening, and degradation of pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. For some flowers, however, wall dissolution is restricted to depolymerisation of hemicelluloses and loss of neutral sugars, particularly galactose and arabinose. The few species in which the metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides in flower petals has been studied in depth include carnation, sandersonia, and daylily...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} vaccine virus {{is capable of}} {{multiplying}} in cultures <b>of</b> susceptible <b>tissues</b> is well established. Some investigators (1), however, have claimed {{that it is possible}} to obtain an increase of this infectious agent in the absence of living host cells. These claims have not been substantiated. Indeed, Harde (Steinhardt) (2, 3) and Nye and Parker (4) have reported that tissues killed by freezing and thawing and by hypotonic salt solutions did not support the survival or multiplication of vaccine virus. Recently Maitland and Maitland (5) recorded observations concerning "cultivation of vaccinia virus without tissue culture. " Their medium consisted of minced chicken kidney suspended in a mixture of chicken serum (1 part) and Tyrode's solution (2 parts). These workers found that the virus increased in the absence of any detectable growth of cells in the cultures. In fact, they state that "after 24 hours the small pieces of kidney had begun to disintegrate, and by the third day <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tissue</b> was extensive. " There is no reason to doubt that vaccine virus multiplied in Maitland's medium. Moreover, Eagles and McClean (6) and Andrewes (7) have shown that certain viruses are capable of increasing under such conditions. Inasmuch as most workers have been unable to cultivate vaccine virus in the absence of living cells, and since it is known that certain cells remain viable under many conditions (8, 9), there are reasons for ascertaining whether living cells can persist or whether growth of ceils can occur in Maitland's medium.

40|$|AbstractThe {{finding that}} {{phospholipid}} micelles lowered the Ca 2 + concentration required for <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the calpains {{led to a}} hypothesis suggesting that the calpains are translocated to the plasma membrane where they interact with phospholipids to initiate their autolysis. However, the effect of plasma membranes themselves on the Ca 2 + concentration required for calpain autolysis has never been reported. Also, if interaction with a membrane lowers the Ca 2 + required for autolysis, the membrane-bound-calpain must autolyze itself, {{because it would be}} the only calpain having the reduced Ca 2 + requirement. This implies that the autolysis is an intramolecular process, although several studies have shown that <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the calpains in an in vitro assay {{and in the absence of}} phospholipid is an intermolecular process. Inside-out vesicles prepared from erythrocytes had no effect on the Ca 2 + concentration required for <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> either μ- or m-calpain, although phosphatidylinositol (PI) decreased the Ca 2 + concentration required for <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the same calpains. The presence of a substrate for the calpains, β-casein, reduced the rate <b>of</b> <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> both μ- and m-calpain both in the presence and in the absence of PI, suggesting that μ- and m-calpain autolysis is an intermolecular process in the presence of PI just as it is in its absence. Because IOV have no effect on the Ca 2 + concentration required for calpain autolysis, association with the plasma membrane, at least with erythrocyte plasma membranes, does not initiate calpain autolysis by reducing the Ca 2 + concentration required for autolysis as suggested by the membrane-activation hypothesis. Interaction with a membrane may serve to bind calpains to their substrates rather than promoting autolysis...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{molecular}} mechanism for <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> Gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, we identified the vvpS gene encoding a serine protease, VvpS, from Vibrio vulnificus, a Gram-negative food-borne pathogen. The amino acid sequence predicted that VvpS consists of two functional domains, an N-terminal protease catalytic domain (PCD) and a C-terminal carbohydrate binding domain (CBD). A null mutation of vvpS significantly enhanced viability during stationary phase, as measured by enumerating CFU and differentially staining viable cells. The vvpS mutant reduced the release of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase and high-molecular-weight extracellular chromosomal DNA into the culture supernatants, indicating that VvpS contributes to the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> V. vulnificus during stationary phase. VvpS is secreted via a type II secretion system (T 2 SS), and it exerts its effects on autolysis through intracellular accumulation during stationary phase. Consistent with this, a disruption of the T 2 SS accelerated intracellular accumulation of VvpS and thereby the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> V. vulnificus. VvpS also showed peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity, indicating that the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> V. vulnificus is attributed to the self-digestion of the cell wall by VvpS. The functions of the VvpS domains were assessed by C-terminal deletion analysis and demonstrated that the PCD indeed possesses a proteolytic activity and that the CBD is required for hydrolyzing peptidoglycan effectively. Finally, the vvpS mutant exhibited reduced virulence in the infection of mice. In conclusion, VvpS is a serine protease with a modular structure and plays an essential role in the <b>autolysis</b> and pathogenesis <b>of</b> V. vulnificus...|$|R

40|$|The <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> trypsin and α-chymotrypsin is {{accelerated}} in {{the presence}} of colloidal silica and glass surfaces. It is proposed that adsorption of the enzymes (favoured by electrostatic factors) results in a conformational change that renders the adsorbed enzyme more susceptible to proteolytic attack. Although the adsorbed enzymes are more susceptible to proteolysis, their activity towards low-molecular-weight substrates is not affected, indicating a relatively minor conformational change on adsorption. The rates <b>of</b> <b>autolysis</b> in solution (i. e. in `inert' vessels) are second-order for both trypsin and α -chymotrypsin, with rate constants of 13. 0 mol− 1 ·dm 3 ·s− 1 for trypsin (in 50 mm-NaCl at pH 8. 0 at 25 °C) and 10. 2 mol− 1 ·dm 3 ·s− 1 for α-chymotrypsin (in 0. 1 m-glycine at pH 9. 2 at 30 °C). In glass vessels or {{in the presence}} of small areas of silica surface (as colloidal silica particles), the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> both trypsin and α-chymotrypsin can show first-order kinetics. Under these conditions, saturation of the surface occurs and the fast surface proteolytic reaction controls the overall kinetic order. However, when greater areas of silica surface are present, saturation of the surface does not occur, and, since for a considerable portion of the adsorption isotherm the amount adsorbed is approximately proportional to the concentration in solution, second-order kinetics are again observed. A number of negatively charged macromolecules have been shown similarly to increase the rate <b>of</b> <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> trypsin: thus this effect, observed initially with glass and silica surfaces, is of more general occurrence when these enzymes adsorb on or interact with negatively charged surfaces and macromolecules.

These observations indicated that complete hydrolysis of N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine linkages (“amidase” action) had occurred. This was confirmed by fractionation {{and analysis of the}} products. Hydrolysis of 4 -O-β-N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramic acid linkages also occurred to a variable extent; on one occasion, complete degradation to disaccharides and hexosamine-free polypeptides (with intact pentaglycine cross-bridges) occurred. In one other instance, hydrolysis within pentaglycine bridges also occurred. Analyses of intact cell walls indicated that, in vivo, glycine endopeptidase activity was negligible and amidase activity was low, but that endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase hydrolysed about 8 % of the N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramic acid linkages. <b>Autolysis</b> <b>of</b> isolated cell walls was too slow for the enzymes isolated with them to have significant action during this isolation. The possible functions of these autolytic activities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Stages in the {{formation}} and degradation of pollenkitt in the anther of Lilium have been investigated using the electron microscope. This material, {{which appears to be}} a complex of lipid and carotenoids, is formed during the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the tapetal cells by the fusion of lipidic inclusions with globules derived from plastids. <b>Autolysis</b> <b>of</b> the tapetal cells is progressive for it commences with the disintegration of many cytoplasmic components, followed by the breakdown of storage lipids. The plasma membrane maintains its integrity during these events apparently, by proliferation, aiding in the transfer of the products of hydrolysis into the loculus. During the course of lipid breakdown, a striking vacuolar system is formed in the tapetal cytoplasm, presumably containing the products of this hydrolysis. The source of membranes for this system is clearly the lipid globules themselves. The generation of the membrane apparently involves the participation of electronopaque material, possibly enzymic, contained within the lipid globules...|$|R
40|$|The female cones (megastrobili) of most Encephalartos species, notably E. altensteinii Lehm. and E. lebomboensis Verdoorn {{which were}} used in this study, {{disintegrate}} basipetally. Initially {{a decrease in the}} water potential of the seeds results in transfer of water from the megasporophylls to the seeds. The resulting expansion of the seeds causes an increase in the diameter of the periferal seed band which sets up a tension in the sporophyll stalks. This tension induces the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> a narrow cross-sectional band <b>of</b> <b>tissue</b> in the basal part of the sporophyll stalk, followed by the rupture of the sporophyll from the cone axis at this point. The enlargement of the seeds also forces the apical seed-bearing sporophylls to slide over the sterile sporophylls at the cone apex. The subsequent dehydration of the sporophylls and simultaneous abscission of the seeds is followed much later by the abscission of the cone axis from the plant’s stem to complete the disintegration process...|$|R
40|$|By {{a variety}} of methods {{necrosis}} of individual cells was produced in the living animal. Cell death was found to be clearly perceptible by means of the changes in the color of segregated erythrolitmin {{at a time when it}} was not as yet recognizable by ordinary histological methods. The hue of the dye pointed to an alteration in the direction of alkalinity; but the extent of this could not be determined owing to the limited range of the indicator Cartilage damaged by freezing in situ becomes alkaline, its reaction now approximating that of the blood. The findings support the view that within the body the <b>autolysis</b> <b>of</b> individual cells and <b>of</b> small <b>tissue</b> masses may take place under the circumstances of a slight alkalinity...|$|R
25|$|While some winemakers will {{inoculate}} their LAB with {{nutrients that}} include nitrogen, {{most of the}} nutrients needed for MLF come from the breakdown (or <b>autolysis)</b> <b>of</b> the dead yeast cells. Additionally, most bacteria used in MLF {{have the ability to}} produce extracellular protease enzymes that can also breakdown larger peptide chains into their base amino acid residues that can then be used for metabolism.|$|R
