5|$|Regardless of his {{personal}} style, Cubitt was credited by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but very costly attack in April 1918; under Major General Cubitt's command, the division mounted two further major operations, at the Battle of Albert in August and Battle of Cambrai in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank {{it as one of}} the most effective British divisions during the Hundred Days Offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised {{the way in which}} the London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now considered to be a critical success <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> skilled satire.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{was born}} into a large family in Dudley, in the Black Country area of the English West Midlands. He {{discovered}} his artistic talent early on and studied art.

He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> mobile camera.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{increased}} {{organization and}} the formation of banding features, it was estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Howard at 0000UTC on August31. A mid-level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest. Early on September1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that Howard had an 80percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> favorable environment around the cyclone. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September1 while the storm was located about 420mi (675km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Later that day, the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric, deep convection. At 0600UTC on September2, Howard was upgraded to a major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higher. Shortly after, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 140mph (220km/h) while located about 410mi (660km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.|$|E
