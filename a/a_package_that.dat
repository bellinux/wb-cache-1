They stop in the village where Mariam was raised, and {{discover}} <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> Mariam's father left behind for her: a videotape of Pinocchio, a small sack of money, and a letter. Laila reads the letter and discovers that Jalil had regretted sending Mariam away. Laila and Tariq return to Kabul and use the money to fix up the orphanage, where Laila starts working as a teacher. Laila is pregnant with her third child, and if it is a girl, Laila has already named her Mariam.|$|E
5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E

5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|Without a no-trade {{clause in}} his {{contract}} with the Canucks and seen as an emerging offensive defencemen throughout the NHL, Bieksa was routinely the subject of trade rumours. In the 2009 off-season, one such trade rumour was central in a feud between general managers Mike Gillis of Vancouver and Brian Burke of the Toronto Maple Leafs. On a Leafs TV documentary on the 2009 NHL Entry Draft that aired in September 2009, a segment involves Burke speculating that the Canucks had offered Bieksa to the Tampa Bay Lightning in <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> included forward Alexandre Burrows and a first-round draft-choice in exchange for Tampa Bay's second-overall selection. The documentary was immediately pulled from airing again and the Maple Leafs received a warning from the League.|$|E
5|$|A film interlude, The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom, {{was adapted}} by the {{animation}} studio Production I.G and premiered in Japanese theaters on August20, 2005, {{in conjunction with}} , between the two seasons of the anime series. Its plot continues the journey from Syaoran's group for Sakura's feathers. They locate one at the Country of Birdcages, {{where they have to}} confront the world's king in order to obtain it. It was directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and written by Midori Goto and Junichi Fujisaku. Character designs were provided by Yoko Kikuchi, and music was by Yuki Kajiura. Clamp artist Ageha Ohkawa liked how both films were connected, despite that both have different themes. Shochiku released the DVD for the film on February25, 2006, in Japan in both regular and premium editions. Funimation released the film on a single DVD in English on February19, 2009, in North America as a double feature with the xxxHolic film.

5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, {{was taking}} her daughters to the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} to board a train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E

25|$|The male’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed {{by the time the}} insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or vas deferens and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central ejaculatory duct, this opens to the outside on an aedeagus or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule.|$|E

25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that</b> included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E
500|$|Sticky Fingers was {{the first}} to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which {{effectively}} became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the outstuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, [...] "Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music." [...] The tongue and lips design was part of <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that,</b> in 2003, VH1 named the [...] "No. 1 Greatest Album Cover" [...] of all time.|$|E

500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany <b>a</b> <b>package</b> <b>that,</b> {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. [...] They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. [...] They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.|$|E
