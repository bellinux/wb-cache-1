40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives {{according to a}} Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by the retailer (such as price <b>adjustment,</b> sales <b>commission,</b> advertisement intensity, etc.). The relation between the action and the demand rate is not known in advance. The retailer will learn the optimal action policy “on the fly ” as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on observed demand reactions. Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic “learning-while-doing” algorithm to achieve a near optimal performance. Furthermore, we prove that the convergence rate of our algorithm is almost the fastest among all possible algorithms in terms of asymptotic “regret ” (the relative loss comparing to the full information optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insights from this research are {{that the value of}} information on 1) the parametric form of demand function and 2) each customer’s exact reservation price are rather marginal. It also suggests the firms would be better off to perform concurrent dynamic learning and doing, instead of learning-first and doing-second in practice. ...|$|R

5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require <b>adjustment</b> at the <b>commissioning</b> stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor.

Sub Theme: Water {{resources}} management, climate change, {{food security}} and sustainable development,The Government of Zimbabwe seeks to introduce land rentals to all land reform beneficiaries to raise revenue to compensate white former farmers and {{raise funds for}} periodic land audits among other reasons. Nonetheless, this is met with mixed feelings and hence, this paper affirms {{that there is a}} knowledge gap between policymakers and the public regarding land taxation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide enlightenment on why land rentals maybe the best choice for Zimbabwe considering fiscal stress, limitations in financing options for public expenditure and shrinking tax bases. The methodology follows an extended literature review from which lessons are drawn and applied to Zimbabwe. By evaluating land taxation against the postulations of theory and empirical evidence, it emerges that land rent is the best option that government has in order to meet objectives and belligerence to it may abate efforts towards sustainable development. Altruism from policy makers and the general public is critical in bearing the costs of <b>adjustments.</b> An independent <b>commission</b> may implement and administrate land tax and supporting programmes to balance the trade-off of gains to government and the public.

40|$|Biomass burning {{is a major}} {{environmental}} problem in Amazonia. Satellite fire detections represent {{the primary source of}} information for fire alert systems, decision makers, emissions modeling groups and the scientific community in general. Those various users create a growing demand for good quality fire data of higher spatial and temporal resolution that can only be achieved via integration of multiple satellite fire detection products. The main objective of this dissertation was to develop an integrated fire product capable of improved monitoring and characterization of fire activity in Brazilian Amazonia. Two major active fire detection algorithms based on MODIS and GOES data were used to meet the users demand for fire information. Large differences involving the performance of the MODIS and GOES fire products required the quantification of omission and commission errors in order to allow for appropriate treatment of individual detections produced by each data set. Relatively small omission errors due to cloud obscuration were estimated for Brazilian Amazonia. Regional climate conditions result in reduced cloud coverage in areas of high fire activity during the peak of the dry season, therefore minimizing the effects of cloud obscuration on fire detection omission errors. Clear sky omission and commission errors were largely dependent on the vegetation and background conditions. Relatively large commission errors occurring in high percentage tree cover areas suggested that fire detection algorithms must either be regionalized or incorporate additional tests to provide more consistent fire information across a broader range of surface conditions. Integration of MODIS and GOES fire products using a physical parameter describing fire energy (i. e., fire radiative power) was proven difficult due to limitations involving the interplay between sensor characteristics and the types of fires that occur in Amazonia. As part of this research, a new integrated product was generated based on binary fire detection information derived from MODIS and GOES data, incorporating <b>adjustments</b> to reduce <b>commission</b> and omission errors and optimizing the complementarities among individual detections. These findings made a significant contribution to fire monitoring science in Amazonia and could {{play an important role in}} the development of future fire detection algorithms for tropical regions...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} potential {{options for}} government {{assistance to the}} automotive manufacturing industry and invites readers to make submissions. Key points: 	Australia’s automotive manufacturing industry is undergoing significant change. 	 		Ford and Holden announced their manufacturing plants will close by 2016 and 2017. Toyota will decide this year on {{the production of the}} next generation Camry. 		A number of component manufacturers and employees will be affected. 	 	 	The policy rationales for specific assistance to automotive manufacturing are weak. The community would benefit from the ending of assistance to automotive manufacturing through the Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS). 	 		There is no compelling evidence that spillover and multiplier benefits exceed the costs of assistance to the industry. 		Decades of transitional assistance have forestalled but not prevented the structural adjustment now being faced by the industry. 		Assistance imposes costs on the community and dulls incentives to improve productivity, seek export opportunities, and diversify into other industries. 	 	 	Current government funding should be reassessed to determine when subsidies should end, and whether to change the timing and amount of funding withdrawn from the ATS. 	 		ATS funding for Toyota and other eligible businesses should cease in 2020, and not be extended or replaced with other specific assistance. 		The closures of the Ford and Holden plants are expected to contribute to an underspend of $ 380  million under the legislated ATS funding schedule by 2020. 		The effect of the uneven profile of funding as outlined in the MYEFO estimates is unclear. It could elevate risks of earlier plant closures by Ford and Holden and might negatively affect investment decisions by Toyota and its component suppliers. A smoother reduction profile would delay the savings benefits, but may reduce adjustment costs. 		The amount of funding withdrawn from the ATS set out in the MYEFO could result in adjustment costs greater than the savings benefits. Further feedback is sought. 	 	 	Firms remaining in automotive manufacturing would benefit from broadly based economic and regulatory reforms and greater workplace flexibility. 	Structural change is often costly for retrenched employees and their families, and may involve job search and training costs, and lead to lower paid or less secure jobs. 	 		Some employees of component manufacturing firms may warrant particular consideration if generally available measures appear to be insufficient. 	 	 	Loss of employment and economic activity will be concentrated in some regions, with some already having relatively high rates of unemployment and disadvantage. 	 		Generally available welfare, employment and training services should be relied on in the first instance, and need to be adequately resourced in the affected regions. 		Regional adjustment programs can be of limited value. Infrastructure investment and labour adjustment programs, where warranted, need to be designed in ways that generate net benefits for the community as a whole. 	 	 	Given the advanced notice of Ford and Holden plant closures, there is time to learn from previous <b>adjustment</b> programs. The <b>Commission</b> is seeking further input. You are invited to examine the paper and to make written submissions by Thursday 13 February 2014. Find out more about making submissions here...|$|R
