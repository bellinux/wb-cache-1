5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|E
5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b> According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E

50|$|A mix of Ratzeputz {{with the}} herb-based spirit Heidegeist {{under the name}} 108er is {{especially}} common in the Lüneburg Heath, its name being derived by adding their <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> of 58% and 50% together.|$|R
5000|$|Kachasus {{alcoholic}} content can vary significantly, {{depending on the}} strength of the brew and a research on the composition and safety of it conducted in 2001 by the University of Zambia - UNZA academics, found that it contained about 20 to 30% ethanol [...] Other studies of the beverage have found <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> as high as 70%.|$|R
5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
40|$|For the {{determination}} of blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> two methods are used: the long accepted blood test and the more recent breath test. Breath testers can be divided a portable equipment for pre-selection (just as the so-called breath-tube) and as an equipment for evidence in court. For the latter {{a high degree of}} reliability is wanted. In this report the best known breath testers are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Bianco- The DOC of Greco di Bianco {{is one of}} the few {{predominant}} {{white wine}} regions in Calabria. The area produces most sweet wine from the Greco bianco grape that have <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> of at least 17%. The wines are typically produced as straw wines with the grapes being partially dried prior to pressing and fermentation. Greco di Bianco is characterized by a deep amber color and aromas of citrus and herbs.|$|R
40|$|Tape ketan is {{the product}} of {{fermentation}} process using black glutinous riceas basic ingredients, which then fermented for two to three days and finally produced tape ketan, organic acid and alcohol. The purpose of this research was to determine <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> of fermentated black tape ketan based on different fermentation time with three diferent methods. Methods used are specific gravity, refractive index and GC-MS. Alcohol concentration obtained by using specific gravity method at 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 days of fermentation, respectively, are 3. 17 % v / v; 3. 02 % v / v; 3. 63 % v / v; 3, 12 % v / v; and 4. 47 % v / v, using the method of refractive index is 3. 90 % v / v; 3. 69 % v / v; 4. 31 % v / v; 3. 80 % v / v and 5. 04 % v / v, and using GC-MS method was 4. 30 % v/v; 4. 23 % v/v; 5. 01 % v/v; 4. 75 % v/v; and 5. 34 % v/v. The variation of fermentation time obviously did not influence the produce of <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> statistically...|$|R
5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{methanol}} or butanol addition to gasoline on exhaust emissions and noise level has been experimentally investigated. Results showed that the concentrations of CO and NO x emissions were decreased depending on the higher <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> and the carbon monoxide concentration of gasoline was {{higher than that of}} methanol or butanol-gasoline blends for all engine loads. It was determined that content of the HC was decreased at higher engine load but noise level was increased...|$|R

Kefir was produced using pasteurized cow milk with traditional method. Kefir grains, purchased from Sales Office of Agriculture Faculty of Ankara University, were directly added to the pasteurized and cooled milk, then incubated for 24  h at 25  °C. After fermentation, kefir was obtained by separating the grains from the beverage. Samples from these four fermented beverages were collected for testing their <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{consumption}} of alcohol in public places is generally forbidden, regardless of the time (in a few provinces and territories this is still not enforced), unless a permit {{to do so is}} delivered by the responsible municipal authorities. In Quebec the {{consumption of}} beverages with low <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> is permitted in public if accompanied by food. In all of the provinces and territories, the {{consumption of alcohol}} is forbidden while driving, with Ontario and Quebec also forbidding the possession of open non-empty containers within a motionless vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b> Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E

50|$|This {{tradition}} of flavoring is also {{prevalent in the}} Nordic countries, where vodka seasoned with herbs, fruits and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities. Sweden has forty-odd common varieties of herb-flavored vodka (kryddat brännvin). In Poland and Ukraine, a separate category (nalyvka in Ukraine and nalewka in Poland) is used for vodka-based spirits with fruit, root, flower, or herb extracts, which are often home-made or produced by small commercial distilleries. Their <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents</b> vary between 15 and 75%. In Estonia, vodkas are spiced with barbaris, blackcurrant, cherry, green apple, lemon, vanilla and watermelon flavors.|$|R

Saturated alcohols were mainly even-number carbon of C 20 ～ 30 and C 15; Unsaturated linear alcohols were mainly C 20 - 1 π, C 20 - 2 πand C 19 - 4 π. HAs from soils under C 3 and C 4 plant cultivation were different in some aspects. C 3 -HA contained more unsaturated alcohol, whereas C 4 -HA contained more saturated alcohol (especially C 12 and C 26) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E
40|$|Romania is well {{recognized}} for the wine consumption, vineyards {{and for its}} specific important varieties of grapes. Accordingly to the statistical data (EUROSTAT), in Romania the gross grape annual consumption for 2008 was 5. 532 kg / inhabitant and 25. 379 l wine / inhabitant. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze by comparison certain types of wines from Romania in order to underline the influence of the raw material and technology on the total quality of the final product. For this, there were selected home made wines, ordinary wines and also superior wines, red and white.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, bar work {{is often}} not {{regarded}} as a long-term profession (except if you are also a landlord), but more often as a second occupation, or transitional work for students to gain customer experience or to save money for university fees. As such, it lacks traditional employment protections and therefore has a high turnover. The high turnover of staff due to low wages and poor employee benefits results in a shortage of skilled bartenders. Whereas a career bartender would know drink recipes, serving techniques, <b>alcohol</b> <b>contents,</b> correct gas mixes, licensing law and would often have cordial relations with regular customers, short-term staff may lack these skills. Some pubs prefer experienced staff, although pub chains tend to accept inexperienced staff and provide training.|$|R

5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b> Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E

(2010). The absence of the growth of the yeast in pawpaw, banana and watermelon wine and banana and watermelon wine could be due to the high alcoholic content which exceeded the ethanolic tolerance level of the yeast used for fermentation.|$|R
