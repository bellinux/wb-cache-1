5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for <b>a</b> <b>contractor</b> or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with <b>a</b> <b>contractor</b> or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer-aided {{decision support system}} for assessing <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> competitiveness. Measures of competitiveness are employed to describe <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> strengths and weaknesses, thus to assist project clients in identifying proper contractors at the pre-qualification stage. The identification of <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> weakness can also help the contractor adopt proper measures to improve its competitiveness. Based on a competitiveness scoring model, a Windows-standard Decision Support System Contractor's Competitiveness Assessment Scoring System (C-CASS) was developed in this study. Case studies in a simulated environment are used to demonstrate the application of this system. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Although it's {{believed}} that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and geotechnical investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location.

In 2005, the university {{filed a lawsuit against}} <b>a</b> <b>contractor,</b> for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court settlement. Amid these concerns, on September 2010, the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. <b>A</b> <b>contractor</b> for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E

A labor strike by BART's two major unions was underway at the time, which cause BART to use an undertrained operator. Instead of the usual 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer {{was not in the}} cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the passenger compartment. BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.|$|E
5|$|One of McCreary's first acts as {{governor}} was signing a bill appropriating $75,000 {{for the construction}} of a new governor's mansion. The legislature appointed a commission of five, including McCreary, to oversee the mansion's construction. The governor exercised a good deal of influence over the process, including the replacement of a conservatory with a ballroom in the construction plan and the selection of <b>a</b> <b>contractor</b> from his hometown of Richmond as assistant superintendent of construction. Changing societal trends also affected construction. A hastily constructed stable to house horse-drawn carriages was soon abandoned in favor of a garage for automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with <b>a</b> <b>contractor,</b> and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway line over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single lane of road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
40|$|The {{reasonable}} {{choice of}} a proper project delivery system (PDS) {{is one of the}} key links to project success. Research in this area has focused on decision making in PDSs. However, project success depends not only on the science of choosing a PDS but also, to a large extent, on the degree of contractor adaptation to the chosen delivery system or the degree to which the contractor characteristics match the PDS. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the key contractor characteristic factors that affect project success under different PDSs by collecting data on these delivery systems from previously completed projects that adopt and track the characteristics of contractors involved in these projects. A total of 12 contractor characteristic factors that affect project success under different PDSs were obtained via a literature review. Next, according to 73 research samples from successful projects in China that adopted different PDSs selected from questionnaires, the key contractor characteristics factors that affect project success under different PDSs were explored using rough set model. The findings indicate that <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> coordination and communications, <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> experience with similar types of projects, <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> ability in financial management, and <b>a</b> <b>contractor's</b> design capability are the four most key factors for project success under different PDSs. This study provides theoretical support for the owner in selecting a project PDS and also provides a theoretical basis on which the owner can select qualified contractors according to the chosen PDS.

5|$|The manor of Southcote {{remained}} in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century, when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave. Henry died in 1927, though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty {{following the death of}} Wastel Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively. In 1920 the house had been purchased by <b>a</b> <b>contractor</b> with intentions to demolish the site, though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house.

5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, <b>a</b> <b>contractor.</b> Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley was found to have planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E
5|$|Jet Airways was {{expected}} to begin service to Newark via Brussels in June 2005. In March 2005, the airline submitted an application to the United States Department of Transportation; however, the application was opposed by Nancy Heckerman, CEO of a US registered company Jet Airways Inc., based in Bethesda, Maryland, alleging trademark infringement and connections to terrorist outfit Al Qaeda. Jet Airways rebuffed the claims. Asmin Tariq, <b>a</b> <b>contractor</b> working for the airline as a security agent at Heathrow airport was implicated in the foiled terror plot on 10 August 2006 to blow up several transatlantic airliners belonging to three different US airlines. Subsequently, the Governments of UK and Singapore inquired security-related information from the Ministry of External Affairs on Jet Airways; clearance was further delayed to fly to the US. The US State Department gave the go-ahead for the airline to fly to the US on 15 November 2006.|$|E
