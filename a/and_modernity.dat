5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>modernity</b> to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|Written {{in formal}} Malay and {{including}} traditional Minangkabau storytelling {{techniques such as}} pantuns, Sitti Nurbaya touches on the themes of colonialism, forced marriage, <b>and</b> <b>modernity.</b> Well-received upon publication, Sitti Nurbaya continues to be taught in Indonesian high schools. It {{has been compared to}} Romeo and Juliet and the Butterfly Lovers.|$|E
5|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the study has resulted in information being gathered on subjects ranging from urban planning to gender studies. By using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, and by including considerable amounts of oral history, it has allowed for a vivid recreation of the society of early urban New Zealand. Several books have resulted from the project, among them Sites of Gender: Women, Men <b>and</b> <b>Modernity,</b> 1890–1939, edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R. Law (Auckland University Press, 2003) and Class and Occupation: The New Zealand Reality by E. Olssen and M. Hickey (University of Otago Press, 2005).|$|E

5|$|The new {{building}} {{was designed for}} attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>modernity</b> to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC's offices. Behind it was the main terminal; this held a communal third-class waiting room, mortuaries and storerooms, the LNC's workshops, and a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. This building led onto the two platforms, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office.|$|E
5|$|Written over {{a period}} of several years and {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs in its use of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several of the hallmarks of traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition <b>and</b> <b>modernity.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance <b>and</b> <b>modernity.</b> It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization <b>and</b> <b>modernity</b> (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
