5|$|Dystopia has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, and holds a Metacritic rating of 69/100. Commending the band's {{return to a}} more aggressive style, Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that Dystopia put the band back on track and started {{a new chapter in}} the band's storied career. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and cynical lyrics <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was a first-rate Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and Loureiro.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The aim of my {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to create a well-arranged guide to New England, the northeastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>of</b> America. <b>The</b> thesis is divided into six main sections. Each section is further divided into a historical summary and a part about a dominating feature <b>of</b> each <b>state</b> <b>of</b> New England. <b>The</b> first chapter describes the history of Massachusetts and takes {{a closer look at the}} capital city, Boston. The second section is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Connecticut and <b>about</b> a few historical cities lying on its coast. The next part is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Rhode Island and its main natural feature, the Narragansett Bay. The fourth section informs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> New Hampshire. <b>The</b> fifth chapter describes the history of Vermont and mainly deals with the production of maple syrup. And finally, the last part gives information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Maine and <b>the</b> lighthouses of Maine, its dominating feature...|$|R
5|$|In the 2008 general election, BN was {{returned}} to power {{for the first time}} without its customary 2/3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat, meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without the support of opposition parties. The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's economy and increasing ethnic tensions within the country; the three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government's response to widening economic disparities. The month after, the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non-Malays citizenship, the latter should not seek equality or special treatment. In his speech, the prince also called for Malay unity to ensure that Malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved.|$|E
5|$|Crocker {{launched}} {{the second phase}} of Operation Charnwood at 07:30, although neither division had yet reached its objectives. The 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was still in control of high ground around the Carpiquet airfield on the right flank of the advance. On the left, facing the relatively weak defences of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, the 3rd Infantry Division made good progress. They attacked Lébisey and rapidly pushed through the village, although fighting intensified as the division reached Hérouville. Concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe division, General Heinrich Eberbach, in command of Panzer Group West ordered the 21st Panzer Division to redeploy north-east of Caen in support. The manoeuvre was spotted and when 21st Panzer attempted to cross the Caen Canal, a naval bombardment was directed against them. Facing the possibility of heavy losses, the move was abandoned. In the centre, the 176th Brigade of the 59th Division was encountering much stiffer resistance from the 12th SS Panzer Regiment in Galmanche and la Bijude. The 197th Brigade bypassed Galmanche and by noon had reached St-Contest.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen {{to greet the}} French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for {{the mouth of the}} nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four swivel guns.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the task of}} pointing ships into the channel, the lighthouse also signaled ships <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide. During the day this was performed using two day signals installed on two corners of the structure, while during the night two 6th order dioptric lights showing different colors coded the state of the tide. The different colours were changed manually, by lowering glass cylinders over the lanterns, which could be done from inside the structure. Records of the tide were also kept automatically by floats in tubes which graphed the tide level. The graphs were replaced every month and were sent to Greenwich where they were kept.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{travelled}} through Europe gathering support for, and inviting participation in, her work-in-progress The Woman's Bible. One evening, Stanton {{spoke to a}} crowd at Clark's home <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suffrage movement in America. Local clergymen present questioned Stanton about the Bible's position of woman in relation to man, and Stanton described at length how equality among the sexes was supported by Bible verse, but that the Bible could be selectively quoted to support conflicting arguments. Because of this, said Stanton, it should be limited in its authority. Clark, though sympathetic to Stanton's views, expressed to Stanton her fear {{that some of the}} strictest of those in attendance might have been shocked by her ultra-liberal opinions.|$|E
25|$|In a middeck stowage locker, Atlantis {{carried the}} Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Communication Unit (CUCU) {{developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) {{in collaboration with}} NASA to the ISS.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, based on {{classified}} data <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. economy and society supplied to him by fellow analysts at FAPSI, Panarin forecast the probable disintegration of the US into six parts in 2010 (at the end of June – start of July 2010, as he specified on 10 December 2008), following a civil war triggered by mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation. He forecast financial and demographic changes provoking a political crisis in which wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government, effectively seceding from the Union, leading to social unrest, civil war, national division, and intervention of foreign powers. Panarin sees {{the task of the}} world elite as not letting the USA follow the Yugoslavian model of disintegration; it is desirable that it follows the Czechoslovakian model of disintegration so that everything goes calmly and peacefully.|$|E
25|$|As {{a part of}} this expansion, the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, {{was raised}} on 1 September 1965 at Puckapunyal in Victoria, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eric Smith. The {{battalion}} drew the majority of its experienced personnel from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which had been serving in Malaysia as part of Australia's involvement in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. The rest of 7 RAR's personnel were national serviceman from the second intake. Due to the large numbers of national servicemen that the battalion received from the outset, upon formation 7 RAR's average age was estimated at only 22 years. A number of these national servicemen went on to command sections as non commissioned officers or platoons as newly commissioned subalterns. At this time the battalion adopted a pig as its mascot, following an observation by the commanding officer <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers' mess at Puckapunyal.|$|E
25|$|New South Wales {{politician}} Henry Parkes (who {{later became}} premier) was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary and appealed {{for help to}} Florence Nightingale for trained nurses. Consequently, in March 1868 Lucy Osburn was sent out as Lady Superintendent of the Infirmary and was accompanied by five trained nurses. Osburn won Parkes' trust and began the challenging task of cleaning up the crumbling, foul-smelling and vermin-infested Infirmary. A week after their arrival they had a royal patient, when the Duke of Edinburgh was wounded by a would-be assassin at Clontarf. They nursed him at Government House, not Sydney Hospital. In spite of the public acclaim this brought them, Lucy Osburn and her staff faced much resistance {{in their efforts to}} reform the infirmary. In addition to the appalling conditions, they met with hostility and opposition. The idea of gentlewomen working as hospital nurses was still novel, and to many people shocking. Lucy was continually obstructed by one surgeon, Dr Alfred Roberts, and personally attacked in the Parliament.|$|E
