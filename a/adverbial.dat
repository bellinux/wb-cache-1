5|$|In this clause the <b>adverbial,</b> helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the <b>adverbial</b> was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, <b>adverbial</b> phrases and dependent clauses. (<b>Adverbial</b> phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to do an {{investigation}} of <b>adverbials</b> in fiction and non-fiction texts translated into Swedish and English. <b>Adverbials</b> are more flexible regarding position in sentences than other constituents. It has been of interest to find out if there are any remarkable differences in mean-ing due to repositioned <b>adverbials</b> in translation, and the focus has been on <b>adverbials</b> in initial, medial and final position. The results showed that most <b>adverbials</b> retained their position, and also their meaning in translation. There were no noteworthy differences in how <b>adverbials</b> were translated in fiction compared to non-fiction. The preferred position of <b>adverbials</b> was the end position for most types of <b>adverbials</b> in English and Swedish...|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular <b>adverbial</b> forms, such as good which has the <b>adverbial</b> form well.|$|E

A Functional Approach to the Analysis of English Fiction Language {{investigates the}} {{function}} {{and use of}} some English <b>adverbials</b> as tools for creating literary meaning and effect. <b>Adverbials</b> function as deictic markers, operating on salient fields of our cognition, for example time, space and circumstance, the deictic expressions {{of which can be}} mapped onto other, more abstract fields such as narrative deixis and discourse deixis. The study is divided into two parts.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} the {{question}} of why certain S-modifying <b>adverbials</b> are only interpretable with respect to the discourse or spatio-temporal context, and not just their own matrix clause. It is not possible to list these <b>adverbials</b> because the set of <b>adverbials</b> is compositional and therefore infinite. Instead, we investigate the mechanisms underlying their interpretation. We present a corpus-based analysis of the predicate argument structure and interpretation of over 13, 000 S-modifying <b>adverbials.</b> We use prior research on discourse deixis and clause-level predicates to study the semantics of the arguments of S-modifying <b>adverbials</b> and the syntactic constituents from which they can be derived. We show that many S-modifying <b>adverbials</b> contain semantic arguments that may not be syntactically overt, but whose interpretation nevertheless requires an abstract object from the discourse or spatio-temporal context. Prior work has investigated only a small subset of these discourse connectives; at the clause-level their semantics has been largely ignored and at the discourse level they are usually treated as “signals” of predefined lists of abstract discourse relations. Our investigation sheds light on the space of relations imparted by a much wider variety of <b>adverbials.</b> We further show how their predicate argument structure and interpretation can be formalized and incorporated into a rich intermediate model of discourse that alone among other models views discourse connectives as predicates whose syntax and semantics must be specified and recoverable to interpret discourse. It is not only due to their argument structure and interpretation that <b>adverbials</b> have been treated as discourse connectives, however. Our corpus contains <b>adverbials</b> whose semantics alone does not cause them to be interpreted with respect to abstract object interpretations in the discourse or spatio-temporal context. We explore other explanations for why these <b>adverbials</b> evoke discourse context for their interpretation; in particular, we show how the interaction of prosody with the interpretation of S-modifying <b>adverbials</b> can contribute to discourse coherence, and we also show how S-modifying <b>adverbials</b> can be used to convey implicatures. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is, through a general comparison between learners’ corpora and NSs’ corpora, to probe into the characteristics of Chinese EFL learners {{with regard to their}} use of linking <b>adverbials</b> in speaking and writing, and give a detailed description about the non-nativeness that the learners demonstrate in the use of linking <b>adverbials.</b> In {{this research}}, we mainly adopt learner corpus based approach. This research has been conducted through three steps. The first step is to find out the related corpora. The corpora used in this study contain two parts, namely, the learner corpora (CLEC and COLSEC) and the native speakers’ corpora (LLC and LOCNESS). Second, with the aid of MicroConcord, we search the linking <b>adverbials</b> one by one in the four corpora respectively, and get the normalized frequencies and the context information. The final step is data processing and multifold analyses. We carry out a contrastive study on the individual linking <b>adverbials</b> used by the two groups through investigating the frequencies and the context information and try to find out the differences. It is found: (1) Chinese EFL learners have shown an overall overusing tendency in using linking <b>adverbials</b> in their speaking and writing. (2) Despite the general overusing tendency, Chinese EFL learners display two opposite tendencies in the use of corroborative <b>adverbials</b> in different registers. Namely, they overuse the corroborative linking <b>adverbials</b> in their speaking, but underuse them in their writing. (3) Chinese EFL learners demonstrate a different pattern of writing-speaking difference as the NSs do in the use of linking <b>adverbials,</b> i. e., they tend to use more linking <b>adverbials</b> in their speaking than they do in their writing; conversely, NSs use more linking <b>adverbials</b> in their writing than they do in their speaking. (4) The results have shown that the factors which contributing to Chinese EFL learners’ use of linking <b>adverbials</b> are multifold, such as mother tongue transfer, pedagogical instructions, stylistic awareness, semantic understanding, pragmatic considerations. The implications of this research for EFL learning and teaching are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to verify the unmarked {{sequence}} of the chosen contextually unbounded <b>adverbials</b> (free verbal modifications) in Czech depending on, particularly, valency, semantics, form, length {{and the type of}} utterance in which they occur. The results of the thesis were gathered from linguistic analysis of more than 1, 700 utterances from the data of the Prague Dependency Treebank. It was shown that the factor of the verbal valency works stronger in the unmarked word order sequence than the influence of their semantics does (the membership in the semantic category, for example, of locus, time, manner and so on). In the basic word order in Czech, there are firstly the optional contextually unbounded <b>adverbials</b> and only then the obligatory ones. It is their semantics that decides the order of the optional <b>adverbials</b> (not expressed by the dependent clause). In contrast to the optional <b>adverbials,</b> the obligatory contextually unbounded <b>adverbials</b> also have clearly stronger tendency to appear {{in the role of the}} actual rheme in the functional sentence perspective. At the same time, optional contextually unbounded <b>adverbials</b> occur in both the anteposition and postposition, the obligatory ones in the postposition.

40|$|International audienceI {{will defend}} and generalize an {{analysis}} of measure <b>adverbials</b> in which measure <b>adverbials</b> are part quantifiers ranging over the parts of some measuring entity. This analysis was first proposed for temporal measure <b>adverbials</b> by Dowty (1979). 1 In this account, the PP for two hours in (la) quantifies over subparts of an interval of two hours. The analysis can be generalized to spatial measure <b>adverbials</b> as in (lc) and (ld) so that, for example, worldwide in (lc) quantifies over geographical subregions of the globe. I will show that together with some simple assumptions about the event structure of verbs, this analysis correctly predicts that in general, measure <b>adverbials</b> apply only to predicates that denote atelic (undelimited) events or ones having homogeneous extensions. Thus, this homogeneity requirement need not be stipulated {{as it is in}} accounts which treat measure <b>adverbials</b> as event predicates rather than quantifiers.
