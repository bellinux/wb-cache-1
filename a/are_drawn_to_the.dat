25|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.|$|E

25|$|The City of Hoover was {{incorporated}} in 1967. It {{was named after}} William H. Hoover, a local insurance company owner. The area had been known as the Green Valley community since the 1930s and was mostly a residential community. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the city was still mostly residential with a small City Hall that included space for the police department. The annexation of the Riverchase business and residential community on September 8, 1980 provided a base of large office buildings and employers to the city. A significant change to the city occurred when Interstate I-459 was opened with a major interchange with Interstate I-65 within the city. The most dramatic change occurred in 1986 when the Riverchase Galleria shopping-hotel-office complex opened. This significantly increased the tax revenue for the city. It was the catalyst to bring new residents and businesses to the city. The city has grown extremely fast with annexations and new developments. The city now provides services from many large city facilities including a Municipal Center, a Library, and a Public Safety Center. Residents and businesses <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city because of the rolling hills and nice residential areas, schools, city services, shopping, and business communities. The city will likely continue to boom population wise; the population has risen significantly in Hoover from 2008 and is now 81,619 as of the 2010 Census.|$|E

Following this, an enormous mother ship lands at the site, releasing animals and over a dozen long-missing adults and children, all from different past eras. Among these returned abductees include the missing pilots from Flight 19 and sailors from the Cotopaxi, all of whom have strangely not aged since their abductions. Barry is also returned and reunited with a relieved Jillian. The government officials decide to include Roy in a group of people whom they have selected to be potential visitors to the mothership, and hastily prepare him.|$|E
