Two packed bed target designs for accelerator transmutation of waste are presented and compared: 1) A right circular cylinder, and 2) A conical target geometry. The target designs are based on requirements set by preliminary blanket designs. These requirements include: axisymmetric target geometry consistent with an axisymmetric blanket; 30 mA/ 1 GeV protons at the target window, uniformly distributed over a 36 cm diameter beam spot (30 µA/cm 2); spallation neutron to incident proton ratio (n/p) of 25 or better; and uniform <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> of spallation neutrons.

40|$|Unlike {{the fresh}} fuel approach, which assumes the initial isotopic {{compositions}} for criticality analyses, any burnup credit methodology {{must address the}} proper treatment of <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distributions.</b> A straightforward way of treating a given <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distribution</b> is to segment the fuel assembly into multiple meshes and to model each burnup mesh with the corresponding isotopic compositions. Although this approach represents {{a significant increase in}} modeling efforts compared to the uniform average burnup approach, it can adequately determine the reactivity effect of the <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distribution.</b> A major consideration is what <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distributions</b> are appropriate for use in light of many possible distributions depending on core operating conditions and histories. This paper summarizes criticality analyses performed to determine conservative <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distributions.</b> The conservative <b>axial</b> burnup <b>distributions</b> presented in this paper are included in the Topical Report on Actinide-Only Burnup Credit for Pressurized Water Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel Packages, Revision 1 submitted in May 1997 by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

40|$|Current {{models of}} mitotic {{chromosome}} structure are {{based largely on}} the examination of maximally condensed metaphase chromosomes. Here, we test these models by correlating the distribution of two scaffold components {{with the appearance of}} prophase chromosome folding intermediates. We confirm an <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> of topoisomerase IIalpha and the condensin subunit, structural maintenance of chromosomes 2 (SMC 2), in unextracted metaphase chromosomes, with SMC 2 localizing to a 150 - 200 -nm-diameter central core. In contrast to predictions of radial loop/scaffold models, this <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> does not appear until late prophase, after formation of uniformly condensed middle prophase chromosomes. Instead, SMC 2 associates throughout early and middle prophase chromatids, frequently forming foci over the chromosome exterior. Early prophase condensation occurs through folding of large-scale chromatin fibers into condensed masses. These resolve into linear, 200 - 300 -nm-diameter middle prophase chromatids that double in diameter by late prophase. We propose a unified model of chromosome structure in which hierarchical levels of chromatin folding are stabilized late in mitosis by an axial "glue"...|$|E

Two different geometries, namely the circular tube and the parallel plate channel, are considered.

A finite element procedure, based on a projection algorithm, is employed for the step-by-step solution of the parabolized momentum and energy equations. <b>Axial</b> <b>distributions</b> of the local overall Nusselt number and of the apparent Fanning friction factor are presented with reference to both heating and cooling conditions for two diffierent values of the Biot number.

30|$|The {{fluidization}} {{characteristics that}} have been studied mainly include the average solid holdup, the axial average solid holdup and the bed expansion coefficient (Ahuja and Patwardhan 2008; Sun et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2015). The average solid holdup in the dense region is the key parameter for designing industrial fluidized beds. Avidan and Yerushalmi (1982) reviewed earlier studies {{on the effect of}} superficial gas velocity on the void ratio at high velocity. Lu et al. (1996 a, b) have studied the average solid holdup in the dense zone in a turbulent bed and obtained a correlation of it. The axial average solid holdup distribution is crucial for investigation of the momentum transfer, mass transfer and heat transfer between gas and solid. Cai et al. (2008) found that the average dense zone solid holdup decreased with increasing height of the fluidized bed. Recently, Cui et al. (2014) studied the <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> and evolution of solid holdup in a fluidized bed-Riser coupled reactor and the effect of superficial gas velocity on the <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> of solid holdup. Zhu et al. (2014) studied the <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> of solid holdup in a pre-lifting structure with two strands of catalyst inlets. The bed expansion coefficient is widely used to determine the height of the dense bed. Lu et al. (1996 a, b) systematically studied the bed expansion coefficient in a turbulent fluidized bed and proposed the empirical equation for prediction of the expansion height in the turbulent fluidized bed. Tang et al. (2012) studied the expansion characteristics of particle mixtures in the dense region of fluidized beds using the bed height-to-dense bed ratio. However, most of these experiments are concentrated on the fluidization characteristics of single-component particles, and the fluidization characteristics of multi-component particles are rarely reported.|$|E

40|$|The phylogenetic {{diversity}} and <b>axial</b> <b>distribution</b> of microorganisms in three {{sections of the}} gastrointestinal tracts of the polychaete Neanthes glandicincta was evaluated using both most probable number method and cloning analyses of 16 S rRNA genes in this study. Quantification of the density of microorganisms in the gut showed that aerobic microorganisms decreased from anterior to posterior, while anaerobic ones showed a reverse trend. The total numbers of microorganisms decreased significantly (p< 0. 05, analysis of variance) but more rapidly from the anterior to the middle segment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the dominating phylogenetic groups included Methanomicrobiales I: Methanosaetaceae (up to 66 % of archaeal clones), δ-Proteobacteria (up to 42 % of bacterial clones), and γ-Proteobacteria (up to 30 % of bacterial clones) widely distributed throughout the entire gut. Other microbiota distributed in different gut sections were Methanomicrobiales II: Methanospirillaceae, Methanomicrobiales III, Thermoplasmatales, Crenarchaea, Methanobacteriaceae, and Methanosarcinales for archaea; and α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Clostridia, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes for bacteria.
