40|$|Abstract. Concrete {{deteriorated}} severely in {{the acid}} deposit environment. To discover the damage {{mechanism of the}} material, changes of microstructure of concrete samples exposed to the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> were executed. A batch of cubic concrete samples with the dimension of 10 × 10 × 10 mm 3 was prepared. <b>Acidic</b> <b>solution</b> with pH level of 2. 5 was deposed by the mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid solution in the laboratory. Mercury intrusion test, SEM/EDS analyses were performed on the samples exposed to the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> for a certain periods. Pore structure and porosity ratio of the concrete samples were obtained. Microstructure, chemical compounds, elemental distribution in the samples exposed to the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> for various periods are achieved. Development of the micro characteristics of concrete with exposure time is discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{deals with}} {{physicochemical}} investigations of anionic membranes in view to better understanding the proton leakage {{phenomenon in the}} treatment of <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions.</b> The membranes of interest consisted of poly (4 -vinylpyridine) ionisable groups grafted on two different copolymer structures. The acidity constant of the two membranes has been determined by confocal Raman microscopy, depending on the pH of the equilibrating <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions,</b> {{and the nature of the}} acid tested. In addition the membranes were shown to exhibit an appreciable electrical conductivity and water content only in the protonated form: the values obtained can be correlated with the pK(a) of the ionisable groups. Calculations of the chemical composition of the membrane in equilibrium with the <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions</b> revealed that the aqueous phase inside the membrane is far less acidic than the external equilibrating solution, leading to the acidity constants in the membrane ((pK(a)) over bar (true)) and another related to the solution phase (pK(a) (apparent)). This fundamental work led to the concentration range of the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> to be treated: the pH of the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> has to be of the order of the apparent pK(a) of the membrane for appreciable content of active poly (4 -vinylpydinium) groups and high selectivity of the ion transport through the membran...|$|R

Hydrothermal pretreatment (HT) was performed prior to anaerobic digestion, and three agents were examined for the HT: hot compressed water, alkaline <b>solution,</b> and <b>acidic</b> <b>solution.</b> The concentrations of glucose and xylose were the highest in the sample pretreated in <b>acidic</b> <b>solution.</b> Compared with that of the untreated sample, the biogas yields from digesting the samples pretreated in alkaline <b>solution,</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>solution,</b> and hot water increased by 364, 107, and 79 %, respectively. The decrease of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in liquid phase followed the same order as for the biogas yield. The initial ammonia content of the treated samples followed the order sample treated in <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> > sample treated in alkaline solution > sample treated in hot water. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were low, indicating that the anaerobic digestion process was running at continuously stable conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of various <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions</b> on the surface mechanical properties of commercial resin composites with different microstructures (Filtek Z 350 XT, TPH 3, Durafill, and Superlux). Specimens were immersed in orange juice, cola, and distilled water for 5 days and the nanohardness, elastic modulus, and wear behavior of the samples were determined via the nanoindentation test and a reciprocating nanoscratch test. The nanoscratch morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the wear depth was recorded by scanning probe microscopy (SPM). The results indicate that the nanofilled resin composites had the greatest hardest and highest elastic modulus, whereas the microfilled composites exhibited the lowest nanohardness and elastic modulus values. SEM observations showed that all resin composites underwent erosion and surface degradation after immersion in <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions.</b> Furthermore, the wear resistance was influenced by the composition of the <b>acidic</b> <b>solution</b> and was correlated with the nanohardness and elastic modulus.
