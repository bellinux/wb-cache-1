500|$|Carey {{performed}} the song {{throughout the entire}} run of her Daydream World Tour (1996), Rainbow World Tour (2000), The Adventures of Mimi (2006), and The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014) and during select shows on her [...] (2002–03), [...] and Angels Advocate Tour (2009–10). During the Japanese shows in 1996, Carey donned a white suit and jacket, and featured three female back-up singers. Red spotlights were used throughout the performance, {{as well as some}} light dance routines. During her Rainbow World Tour, Carey wore a two piece outfit, a pair of pants <b>and</b> <b>top,</b> <b>with</b> golden heels. Three back-up singers were provided, one male and two female, while Carey interacted with the front row fans. On her Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey donned a pair of black leggings, worn with a bikini-like top. Wearing Christian Louboutin pumps, Carey sang on the arena's secondary stage, where she sang three of the set-list's titles. On her Elusive Chanteuse Show in 2014, Carey often used the song as her encore, entering the stage in a tight-fitted blue gown and black gloves. Carey included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's, where she walked through the audience for the second verse and chorus.|$|E
500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com, liked the reinvention {{of the plot}} and the style and {{execution}} of the action sequences, specifically those involving the trio of Mini Coopers, which she wrote were {{the stars of the}} film. BBC reviewer Stella Papamichael gave The Italian Job 4 stars out of 5, and wrote that the [...] "revenge plot adds wallop lacking in the original". Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas praised the opening Venice heist sequence and the characterization of each of the thieves, but felt that the Los Angeles heist sequence was [...] "arguably stretched out a little too long". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing that the film was [...] "two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concurred, describing The Italian Job as pure but smart entertainment [...] "plotted and executed with invention and humor". Reviewer James Berardinelli also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said that Gray had discovered the right recipe to do a heist movie: [...] "keep things moving, develop a nice rapport between the leads, toss in the occasional surprise, <b>and</b> <b>top</b> <b>with</b> a sprinkling of panache." [...] Varietys Robert Koehler compared The Italian Job to The Score (2001), another [...] "finely tuned heist pic" [...] which also featured Edward Norton in a similar role.|$|E

500|$|A {{backdrop}} {{then started}} showing the newspaper reports on Madonna's 1985 Playboy nude picture release. The backdrop moves up as Madonna appears, wearing a loose-fitted black pant <b>and</b> <b>top,</b> <b>with</b> bejeweled glasses, for singing [...] "Where's the Party". For [...] "Into the Groove" [...] Finch joins her on stage to dance alongside. Madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket {{which had the}} can of soup and the words [...] "U" [...] and [...] "DANCE" [...] flanking it. At the end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers. Together they take a bow to the audience and finish the performance. Next Madonna sang [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{as a part of}} the encore, wearing the same red flamenco dress she had worn in the video. For [...] "Who's That Girl", Madonna—flanked by Finch and a male dancer—strutted around the stage, asking the audience to join her on the chorus. Lastly, Madonna performed an energetic version of [...] "Holiday", signaling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song's theme. The song featured a new arrangement, with a guitar solo in the intermediate portion added by Leonard. She sang the final chorus twice, then asked the audience for a comb so that she could fix her hair and finished the performance, after taking a bow with her dancers to the audience.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Transbay Tube {{has also}} {{required}} earthquake retrofitting. The immersed tube {{lies in a}} shallow trench dredged {{on the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay, and was anchored to the bottom by packing around the sides <b>and</b> <b>top</b> <b>with</b> mud and gravel. This fill may be prone to soil liquefaction during an earthquake, which could allow the buoyant hollow tube to break loose from its anchorages. Retrofitting outside the tube compacted the fill, to make it denser and less prone to liquefaction. Inside the tube, BART installed heavy steel plates, to reduce sideways movement in an earthquake. The work was performed between March and December 2013, and BART closed one of the two bores of the tube early on some weeknights. Trains shared a single tunnel between Embarcadero and West Oakland after 10 pm, with travel delays of 15–20 minutes. The work, estimated to take 14 months, was completed after 8 months.|$|E

5000|$|The {{potential}} standard employs two adjacent, standard, orthographic views (here, Front <b>and</b> <b>Top)</b> <b>with</b> {{a standard}} [...] "folding line" [...] between. As {{there is no}} subsequent need to 'circuitously step' 90° around the object, in standard, two-step sequences in order {{to arrive at a}} solution view (it is possible to go directly to the solution view), this shorter protocol is accounted for in the layout. Where the one step protocol replaces the two-step protocol, [...] "double folding" [...] lines are used. In other words, when one crosses the double lines he is not making a circuitous,90° turn but a non-orthodirectional turn directly to the solution view. As most engineering computer graphics packages automatically generates the six principal views of the glass box model, as well as an isometric view, these views are sometimes added out of heuristic curiosity.|$|E
