40|$|International audienceIntroductionShrinking lung {{syndrome}} (SLS) {{is a rare}} respiratory {{manifestation of}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by dyspnea, chest pain, elevated hemidiaphragm and a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. Here, we report 15 new observations of SLS during SLE and provide a systematic literature review. We studied the clinical, biological, functional and morphologic characteristics, the treatments used and their efficacy. MethodsThe inclusion criteria were all patients with SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria Hochberg (1997), associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. The exclusion criteria were all differential diagnoses of restrictive patterns, including obesity and pulmonary fibrosis. The patients were recruited from local databases through chest physicians, rheumatologists and internists. The data for the literature review were extracted from the Medline database using “shrinking lung syndrome” and “lupus” as key words. ResultsAll 15 new cases were women with a median age at SLS onset of 27 years old (range 17 – 67 years). All of them complained of dyspnea and {{all but one of}} chest pain. The antibodies were similar to those found in SLE, although the anti-SS-A was positive in 10 of 13 cases. Thoracic imaging showed elevated hemidiaphragm (12 / 15) and/or basal atelectasia (8 / 15). All of the patients had an isolated restrictive pattern on PFT, with a median decrease > 50 % of lung volume. All of the patients were treated, using corticosteroids (11 / 15), immunosuppressive drugs (8 / 15), beta-mimetics (2 / 15), physiotherapy (3 / 15) and/or colchicine (1 / 15). Improvement was described in 9 of 12 patients and stability in 3 of 12. We extracted 155 cases of SLE-associated SLS from the Medline database. The clinical, biological and functional parameters were similar to our cases. Clinical improvement was described in 48 of 52 cases (94 %) and PFT improvement in 36 of 47 cases. Worsening occurred in 4 cases. ConclusionSLS is a rare SLE manifestation. Pain and parietal inflammation seem to play important pathogenic roles. Steroids and <b>antalgics</b> are the most commonly used therapies with good responses. There is no proof of efficacy with immunosuppressive drugs for this entity. Rituximab can be discussed after failure of corticosteroids, as well as <b>antalgics,</b> theophylline and beta-mimetics...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of {{aminopeptidase}} N {{and neutral}} endopeptidase- 24. 11, two zinc metallopeptidases {{involved in the}} inactivation of the opioid peptides enkephalins, produces potent physiological analgesic responses, without major side-effects, in all animal models of pain in which morphine is active. Dual inhibitors of both enzymes could fill the gap between opioid analgesics and <b>antalgics.</b> Until now, attempts to find a compound with high affinity both for neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N have failed. We report here the design of dual competitive inhibitors of both enzymes with KI values in the nanomolar range. These have been obtained by selecting R 1, R 2, and R 3 determinants in aminophosphinic-containing inhibitors: NH 2 —CH(R 1) P(O) —(OH) CH 2 —CH(R 2) CONH—CH(R 3) COOH, for optimal recognition of the two enkephalin inactivating enzymes, whose active site peculiarities, determined by site-directed mutagenesis, have been taken into account.

40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{prevalence}} (45 - 80 %) chronic {{pain in the}} elderly {{can be considered a}} social disease.

The instruments that are used to self-evaluate pain in an elderly person, even those patients that have a slightly moderate cognitive deterioration, do not differ from those used for a young person. For serious cases of dementia, “etero-evaluation instruments” have been created. The objective of this revision of literature is not only the technical clarification of the state in which this field deals with, but to focus the attention, stimulate the sensibility of those that observe and to help to “translate” signals that might otherwise remain indecipherable or worse yet, interpreted in an incorrect manner.

40|$|Fatigue is {{the most}} {{frequent}} adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration {{of the quality of}} life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify "acute" fatigue from "chronic" fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or <b>antalgics,</b> insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia [...] observed in more than 50 % of the cancerous patients [...] deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.

40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The {{aim of this}} study was to prospectively {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the TVT-O inside-out procedure for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Study design, materials and methods From March 2003 through September 2003, 53 patients with clinical evidence of SUI participated in this prospective clinical trial. Preoperative evaluation included complete history, physical examination, multichannel urodynamics, urine analysis, and cystoscopy. None of the patients presented the following exclusion criteria: post-void residual volume (PVR) ≥ 100 cc, detrusor overactivity or acontractility, contraindication to anesthesia, pregnancy, neurological pathology, or active urinary or vaginal infection. All patients met the following inclusion criteria: age > 25 and < 85 years, clinically demonstrated SUI, positive Ulmsten test, and maximum cystometric capacity ≥ 300 mL. In all patients, a sub-urethral tape (Gynecare®) was inserted by one single surgeon via an inside-out transobturator approach (TVT-O), as previously described (1). Evaluation of SUI, urgency/urge incontinence, daytime urinary frequency/nocturia, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction/retention was carried out using the Measurement of Urinary Handicap scale questionnaire (2). The importance of urinary incontinence was assessed with a visual analog scale graded from 0 to 10. Quality of life (QoL) assessment was performed using the validated Ditrovie self-administered questionnaire. Outpatient follow-up was perfomed at 1 and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up evaluation included physical examination with a stress test, uroflowmetry, PVR, and symptom, visual analog, and QoL scales scoring. Cure was defined as no leakage based on both symptom scale scoring and physical examination. Improvement was defined as at least a 50 % decrease in symptoms based on the questionnaire’s evaluation. Chart review was conducted by a physician not associated with the surgical procedure. The specific protocol used in this study was approved by the Medical Ethics committee of our Institution. All patients had given their written informed consent. Methods, defintions,and units conform to the standards recommended by the ICS. Results Mean age of the patients was 61. 2 years (36 to 80). Of the 53 patients, 20 had undergone previous pelvic surgery. Forty-eight patients suffered from SUI. Five patients did not complain of SUI but had clinical evidence of SUI after reduction of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) during vaginal examination. The TVT-O procedure was associated with POP cure (performed before TVT-O) in 12 patients. Maximal urethral closure pressure was < 30 cm H 20 in 6 patients. Follow-up time was ≥ 6 months in all women (max = 12. 5; mean = 8). A total of 33 and 20 women received spinal and general anesthesia, respectively. Intraoperative blood loss was < 100 cc in all cases. No vaginal wall, urethral, or bladder perforation was encountered. No hematoma, neurological complication, fistula, vaginal or urethral erosion, or tape rejection was observed. Some patients reported pain symptoms, directly after the procedure, mainly located in the thigh regions (either uni- or bilaterally). Pain was always mild, never requiring opioid <b>antalgics.</b> No patient complained of persistent pain; indeed, pain had completely vanished within the first post-operative month in all cases. At the latest follow-up visit, PVR was < 100 cc and max flow rate was ≥ 10 mL/sec in 49 (92. 4 %) and 39 (73. 6 %) patients, respectively. One patient underwent an immediate tape release procedure for complete retention 2 days after TVT-O. Thereafter, the patient had no PVR and was completely dry. The tape was sectioned in 2 patients for chronic retention and/or urgency associated with bladder outlet obstruction, 4 and 7 months after the operation. Based on the SUI questionnaire evaluation and physical examination, 50 (94. 3 %) patients were cured. SUI symptoms had improved in 1 patient and had not changed in another. One patient with POP not complaining of SUI preoperatively (but with clinically demonstrated SUI following POP reduction) developed SUI after POP cure associated with TVT-O. Analysis of the urgency questionnaire’s results revealed that among the 53 patients, 32 did not complain of any urgency before the operation. Of these 32 patients, 3 patients developed de novo urgency, with one of them requiring tape sectioning because of obstruction-associated urge incontinence. Among the 21 patients with preoperative urge symptoms, 15 of them reported disappearance of urgency after the procedure. Urge symptoms were unchanged in the remaining 6 patients. Daytime frequency/nocturia symptoms scale scoring showed that 4 patients had a worsening of these symptoms while all other patients were either improved or unchanged. LUTS suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction/retention appeared or worsened in 3 patients, amongst which the 2 patients who required tape sectioning. These symptoms were unchanged or decreased (mainly in patients with associated POP cure) in all other patients. Analysis of the urinary incontinence visual analog and QoL scale scores demonstrated that the majority of patients reported disappearance of urinary leakage together with significant improvement of their QoL (Figures 1 and 2). Interpretation of results As already suggested by the results of a recent feasibility study (1), TVT-O appears to be associated with a minimal risk of peri-operative complications. Indeed, in our present prospective study, no injury to the bladder, vagina, or urethra was encountered and we have not observed any vascular, digestive or neurological complication. Our data suggest that TVT-O is associated with high objective and subjective SUI cure rates and a low incidence of post-operative complications. Longer follow-up times are required to determine the long-term efficacy of TVT-O.
