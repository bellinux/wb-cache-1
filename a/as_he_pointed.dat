I sat on a panel with him in 1965, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{potentially}} important {{consequence of}} the peace might have been {{that a number of}} provisions of the Treaty of The Hague, that had been conditional on a peace, like the reduction of the French army of occupation, would now have become operational. However, the First Consul proved reluctant to reduce the numbers of French troops, or return the port of Flushing, {{for the good of the}} Dutch <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out, as they needed many of their own troops in their restored colonies, so the [...] "protection" [...] of the French troops was considered necessary. On the other hand, the departure of the French troops was an indispensable point for the British as they could not allow the Netherlands to be dominated by a hostile power, and the Batavian Republic was incapable of defending its own neutrality. This was to be an insoluble dilemma in the coming years.|$|E

[...] The review went on to say, [...] "'Hey Daddy' {{may not be a}} chart-topper-yet-but it sure will make the naysayers pay attention again." [...] Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said that the}} song was [...] "is not only the album's first official single," [...] but [...] "also a declaration." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "In the song, Usher's basically sending a message to his female fans that the Usher they knew and loved is back in their lives and that they don't need to stray any more: [...] "You know your daddy's home, and it's time to play, so you ain't got to give my lovin' away." [...] Nero calls 'Hey Daddy' [...] "one of more than half a dozen sex songs on the album." [...] Sara D. Anderson of AOL Music said that the song has a [...] "catchy R tune" [...] and [...] "the song showcases Usher's role as the ladies' man as he croons: [...] "You know your daddy's home (daddy's home) / And it's time to play (so it's time to play) / So you ain't got to give my loving away." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe said that the track was one of the album's songs to showcase [...] "Usher's signature loveman moves" [...] however called them [...] "hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out the whole album had a lack of emotion Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said that on the song and on [...] "Lil Freak" [...] that Usher shows [...] "he’s unafraid to get lewd".|$|E

Among {{the large}} number of Chinese {{scholars}} who have expressed their views about the date of the Cantong qi, the opinions of Chen Guofu (who was for several decades the main Chinese expert in this field) are especially worthy of attention. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out, no extant alchemical work dating from the Han period is based on the doctrinal principles of the Cantong qi, or uses its cosmological model and its language (Chen Guofu, 1983:352-54). Pregadio's views are even more radical in this regard: [...] "First, neither the Cantong qi nor its cosmological and alchemical models play any visible influence on extant Waidan texts dating not only from the Han period, but also from the whole Six Dynasties (i.e., until the sixth century inclusive)[...] [...] [...] Second, {{the same can be said}} with even more confidence about Neidan, since no text belonging to this branch of Chinese alchemy has existed—or has left traces of its existence—until the eighth century" [...] (Pregadio, 2011:19-20).|$|E
2500|$|Glass's {{music for}} his {{ensemble}} {{culminated in the}} four-hour-long Music in Twelve Parts (1971–1974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass's musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it – the last part features a twelve-tone theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. [...] "I had broken the rules of modernism and so I {{thought it was time}} to break some of my own rules", according to Glass. Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces up to and including Music in 12 Parts, excepting this last part which [...] "was the end of minimalism" [...] for Glass. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out: [...] "I had worked for eight or nine years inventing a system, and now I'd written through it and come out the other end."

2500|$|Bossy has harboured some {{animosity}} towards Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers, {{stating that}} the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty (1980–83) compared to the Canadiens (1976–79) or Oilers (1984–90). Bossy complained [...] "I {{do a lot of}} promoting for how good [...] were...We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn't want guys doing too much, because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don't talk about us in the first mention of great teams." [...] During Gretzky's interview with the New York Post in 1993, he praised Bossy as the best right-winger ever to play, saying that their scoring totals would have been even higher if the two had played together. (They nearly did; in the 1977 WHA Amateur Draft, Bossy was selected by the Indianapolis Racers, who one year later would become Gretzky's first pro team.) Bossy's response in the Post was not complimentary, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that their playing styles were different, and also said that Trottier was the best centre in hockey.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1949 book Philosophy of Modern Music, Theodor W. Adorno {{described}} Stravinsky as an acrobat {{and spoke}} of hebephrenic and psychotic traits {{in several of}} Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky {{is more concerned with}} the [...] "transition to positivity" [...] Adorno found in his neoclassical works. Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neo-classicism, but of greater importance was his music's [...] "pseudomorphism of painting", playing off [...] (time-space) rather than [...] (time-duration) of Henri Bergson. According to Adorno, [...] "one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself". Adorno maintained that the [...] "rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego".|$|E
