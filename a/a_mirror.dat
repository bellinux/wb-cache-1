In the case of {{two-armed}} icons, the left hand rests on Nandi's head, hangs loose or holds either a flower, <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati's wrist.

50|$|Many amateur {{telescope}} makers use cells {{which are}} designed via equal area rule calculation, using {{programs such as}} David Chandler's public domain program, Cell. However, such calculation {{does not account for}} mechanical stresses introduced in one part of <b>a</b> telescope <b>mirror</b> by another part, whereas finite element analysis can be used to reduce such stress. Although general finite element analysis programs such as Nastran will work for <b>mirror</b> cells, <b>an</b> advantage of PLOP is that it can be set to ignore deformation that merely results in refocus of <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> parabola. PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> axial (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> lateral (edge) support.|$|R

5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel {{was not designed}} to be serviced after launch, and had <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter.

5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, {{but he was also}} able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> {{gravitational}} <b>mirror</b> is <b>a</b> non-singular finite redshift surface which bounces all incident null geodesics. While <b>a</b> white <b>mirror</b> (outward bouncing) resembles 't Hooft's brick wall, <b>a</b> black <b>mirror</b> (inward bouncing) {{offers a}} novel mechanism for sealing off curvature singularities. The geometry underlying <b>a</b> two-sided <b>mirror</b> {{is characterized by}} a single signature change, to be contrasted with the signature flip which governs the black hole geometry. To demonstrate the phenomenon analytically, we derive an exact, static, radially symmetric, two-sided mirror solution, which asymptotes the massless BTZ black hole background, and then probe the local structure of <b>a</b> massive <b>mirror.</b> Comment: 4 PRL pages, 2 figure...|$|R
