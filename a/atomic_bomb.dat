5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> during the Second World War. She invented chaff, a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shima Hospital (Shima byōin) was a Japanese {{hospital}} {{destroyed by}} the <b>atomic</b> <b>bombing</b> of Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945. Shima Hospital {{is considered to be}} ground zero for the <b>atomic</b> <b>bombing</b> of Hiroshima.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the basis}} of {{available}} evidence, however, {{it is clear that}} the two <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs</b> ... alone were not decisive in inducing Japan to surrender. Despite their destructive power, the <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs</b> were not sufficient to change the direction of Japanese diplomacy. The Soviet invasion was. Without the Soviet entry in the war, the Japanese would have continued to fight until numerous <b>atomic</b> <b>bombs,</b> a successful allied invasion of the home islands, or continued aerial bombardments, combined with a naval blockade, rendered them incapable of doing so.|$|R
5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use of the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Beginning or the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development of the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation of the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} the Soviets had been officially given {{information}} about the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb,</b> Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E

It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, and a White Paper, Statements Relating to the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Bomb</b> was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain had {{a nuclear}} weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943. Many of Britain's top {{scientists}} participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The successful test of an <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology. In July 1954, Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham {{had made}} a {{breakthrough}} investigating the critical mass of uranium-235 in June 1939. Their calculations indicated that it was within {{an order of magnitude}} of , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum initiated the British <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> project and its Maud Committee, which unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|In total Mount St. Helens {{released}} 24 megatons {{of thermal}} energy, 7 {{of which were}} {{a direct result of}} the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> dropped on Hiroshima.|$|E
