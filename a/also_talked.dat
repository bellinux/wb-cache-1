5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He <b>also</b> <b>talked</b> of the apparent presence of female skeletons.

In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
