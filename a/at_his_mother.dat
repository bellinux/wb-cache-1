500|$|In {{the essay}} [...] "Hamlet Made Simple", David P. Gontar turns {{the tables on}} the psychoanalysts by {{suggesting}} that Claudius is not a symbolic father figure but actually Prince Hamlet's biological father. [...] The hesitation in killing Claudius results from an unwillingness on Hamlet's part to slay his real father. [...] If Hamlet is the biological son of Claudius, that explains many things. [...] Hamlet doesn't become King of Denmark {{on the occasion of}} the King's death inasmuch as it is an open secret in court that he is Claudius's biological son, and as such he is merely a court bastard not in the line of succession. [...] He is angry with his mother because of her long standing affair with a man Hamlet hates, and Hamlet must face the fact that he has been sired by the man he loathes. [...] That point overturns T. S. Eliot's complaint that the play is a failure for not furnishing an [...] "objective correlative" [...] to account for Hamlet's rage <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother.</b> [...] Gontar suggests that if the reader assumes that Hamlet is not who he seems to be, the objective correlative becomes apparent. [...] Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy not because his mother quickly remarries but because of her adulterous affair with the despised Claudius which makes Hamlet his son. [...] Finally, the ghost's confirmation of an alternative fatherhood for Hamlet is a fabrication that gives the prince a motive for revenge.|$|E

2500|$|According to Suetonius, Nero {{was annoyed}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> being too watchful and tried {{three times to}} poison Agrippina, but she took the antidotes in time and survived. He then tried to crush her with a {{mechanical}} ceiling over her bed at her residence. After this failed, he devised a collapsible boat, which would either have its cabin fall in or become shipwrecked. [...] Nero then ordered captains of a different boat to ram this boat while Agrippina was aboard. [...] Nero heard Agrippina survived the wreck so he ordered her to be executed and framed it as a suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The first shinbyu {{in history}} is {{believed}} to have taken place in the Buddha's lifetime two and a half millennia ago. It was his own son Rāhula who approached the prodigal father, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> Yasodharā's bidding, to ask for his inheritance. [...] "Very well", said the Buddha, [...] "here then is my legacy for you", beckoning one of his disciples to shave the head of the young prince and adorn him with the robe of an ascetic in exchange for his princely dress, and Rahula was then bidden to follow the Buddha to his forest monastery.|$|E
2500|$|David P. Gontar in {{his book}} Hamlet Made Simple proposes {{that most of the}} puzzles in the play can be {{resolved}} by conceiving of Prince Hamlet as the son of Claudius, not Hamlet the Dane. [...] Note that Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy well before he meets the Ghost. [...] Gontar reasons that his depression is a result of having been passed over for the Danish throne which is given inexplicably to the King's brother. [...] This tends to imply an impediment to succession, namely illegitimacy. [...] On this reading some collateral issues are resolved: [...] Hamlet is angry <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> for an extramarital affair she had with Claudius, of which he, the Prince, is a byproduct. [...] Further, the reason Hamlet cannot kill the King is not because the King is a father figure but, more strongly, because he is Hamlet's actual biological father. [...] We can deduce, then, that the Ghost is in fact a liar, who shows no concern for Hamlet's own personal welfare. [...] He confirms the fatherhood of King Hamlet in order to give Hamlet an incentive for revenge.|$|E

2500|$|Lines 53–57 {{feature the}} image of a singing poet, which is {{reminiscent}} of how the eclogue began. The poet himself will compete in a rustic environment against Orpheus and Linus, and Pan will be the judge. Virgil's reference to Linus in this section symbolizes [...] "the symbiosis of Hesiodic song culture and erudite, 'bookish' poetics of the so-called Alexandrian poets", resulting in a [...] "uniquely Virgilian pastoral aesthetic." [...] Once the Golden Age will have arrived, the need for arms and soldiers will be obviated, and the competitive drive that—in the past—had fueled war will now fuel [...] "harmless [...] competition for rustic prizes." [...] Lines 60–61 address the birth of the supposed savior, featuring the poet speaking directly to the child; he urges the baby to smile <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> since she had just bore him. Lines 60–63 have proven throughout the ages to be a [...] "fascinating problem", and there is no clear consensus as to what exactly they mean. Nisbet claims that the final line is most likely a reference to a story about Hercules, who dined with Jupiter and took Juventas as his wife, although he noted it could also be a reference to a general Roman nursery saying.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{upcoming}} {{wedding to}} Leo brings Greenlee's mother, Mary Smythe, {{back into her}} life. But {{she does not know}} that Mary is only pretending to care about her {{so as not to be}} cut out of the family will. Greenlee brokers a deal to work at Revlon, and wants to pay back Erica for her attempts at holding her back by working her hardest for the competition. Leo is embroiled in the case to find Vanessa's missing drug money and has charges of tampering with evidence against him that prohibit him from leaving town. Worries that Vanessa and her drug money could spoil the wedding become founded when a former associate of Vanessa's kills Greenlee's father at the wedding. When Greenlee learns that Mary is only being kind to her so her grandfather will put Mary back into his will, Greenlee cuts her off and her dependency on Leo intensifies. The two plan to move to Paris and have a happily ever after once they can turn over Vanessa's drug money and get the charges against Leo dropped. One of Vanessa's supposed alternate personalities reveals to them the coordinates of the missing money, which turns out to be all worthless stocks, and Leo becomes free to take Greenlee to Paris. Before they depart, a deranged Vanessa kidnaps Greenlee and orders Leo to find a stash of diamonds for her. Vanessa, who was also responsible for Frankie's murder, arranges for Leo to give her the diamonds near a cliff overlooking a river.

After struggling with control of Vanessa's gun, Greenlee is left hanging over the edge of the cliff.

Greenlee cannot come to grips with life without Leo and wants to kill herself on multiple occasions, but she is able to go on with the help and support of her brother-in-law, David Hayward.|$|E
