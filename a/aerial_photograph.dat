5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German barbed wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the barbed wire.|$|E
30|$|In {{the long}} term, {{continued}} disturbance of the savanna woody vegetation due {{to one or}} more of the influencing factors could result in change in woody vegetation cover. Historical imagery serves as a data source to enable the detection of this change. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> can supplement satellite imagery for this purpose, given that satellite imagery is only available since the early 1970 s, and high spatial resolution satellite images only since the late 1980 s. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> have the advantage of high spatial resolution, while satellite images are advantageous over <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> in that they enable synoptic coverage of large areas that would require multiple <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> to cover. A number of studies analysing change in woody cover on savannas have used historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> either as a photo only imagery time series (e.g. Hudak and Wessman 1998; Fensham and Fairfax 2003) or in combination with satellite images (e.g. Hudak and Wessman 2001). Appropriate algorithms to delineate the woody vegetation on the imagery are required, particularly when a linkage between historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> and satellite images is being established.|$|R

5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> {{techniques in}} collaboration with the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (Photographic reconnaissance) unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of that campaign, the Admiralty pressed its case for the need for coastal and sea reconnaissance. With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these reconnaissance operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed photographic evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (Photographic Reconnaissance Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, but under the operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E

By 1993, Pierre-Yves Manguin had shown that the centre of Srivijaya was along the Musi River between Bukit Seguntang and Sabokingking (situated {{in what is now}} Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia). Palembang is called in , this is probably a testament of its history as once a great port.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> {{began to}} be used in the 1920s to provide {{topographical}} data. They provide a good database for compilation of shoreline change maps. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> are the most commonly used data source because many coastal areas have extensive <b>aerial</b> photo coverage.Aerial <b>photographs</b> generally provide good spatial coverage. However, temporal coverage is site specific. The interpretation of shoreline position is subjective given the dynamic nature of the coastal environment.

40|$|SUMMARY: Otago has {{a wealth}} of engineering, goldmining and {{agricultural}} sites. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> are essential to recognise and map sites and helpful in interpreting the meaning of patterns. The patterns may reflect a range of underlying variables such as the exploited resource, the facilities needed to exploit it, transport and social {{factors such as the}} supporting settlements, and also modern heritage management issues. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> may also be used in illustrating and dramatising sites. Conventional wide-area aerial photographic coverage is useful but, for detail, custom-flown vertical aerials in medium format film and digital media are better. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> (which date back to about 1945) also have applications, especially where there has been substantial landscape change. On the upper Shotover River, historical processes depended on settlement enclosure and mining capital investment all of which can be investigated using <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs.</b> In addition, examples of <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> of a range of engineering subjects in Otago are shown...|$|R
25|$|Westwood Moravian Church {{was founded}} in 1865 {{following}} some initial house-based work by the Reverend Bennett Harvey (the Minister of the Fairfield Moravian Settlement in Droylsden) and the Reverend Frederic La Trobe over the previous year. The Westwood mission, carried out {{in what was then}} a new industrial district, was organised by the leaders of Salem Moravian Church in eastern Oldham, {{with the support of the}} British Provincial Board, to serve the needs of some of their members who had moved to work in Westwood. In addition, some members of the Dukinfield Moravian Church had also settled in Westwood.

25|$|Until 1970, Ibadan was {{the largest}} city in Sub-Saharan Africa by surface. In 1952, it was {{estimated}} that the total area of the city was approximately 103.8km2 However, only 36.2km2 was built up. This meant that the remaining 67km2 were devoted to non-urban uses, such as farmlands, river floodplains, forest reserves and water bodies. These “non-urban land uses” disappeared in the 1960s: an <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> in 1973 revealed that the urban land-scape had completely spread over about 100km2. The land area increased from 136km2 in 1981 to 210–240km2 in 1988-89 (Areola, 1994: 101). By the year 2000, it is estimated that Ibadan covered 400km2. The growth of the built-up area {{during the second half of}} the 20th century (from 40km2 in the 1950s to 250km2 in the 1990s) shows clearly that there has been an underestimate of the total growth of the city. In the 1980s, the Ibadan-Lagos expressway generated the greatest urban sprawl (east and north of the city), followed by the Eleiyele expressway (west of the city). Since then, Ibadan city has spread further into the neighbouring local government areas of Akinyele and Egbeda in particular.|$|E
25|$|Clark's archaeological {{career was}} put on hold during the Second World War. While {{awaiting}} enlistment into the British armed forces, Clark took lessons in Russian with Minns in order to enable him to read Soviet archaeological publications. He was then drafted into the Royal Air Force (RAF) Volunteer Reserve as a pilot officer, being posted to the central interpretative unit at RAF Medmenham. There, {{he served in the}} <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> interpretation unit, where he worked alongside fellow archaeologists like Daniel, Garrod, Piggott, Philips, and McBurney. This grouping allowed for some continuity in the British archaeological community despite the widespread cessation of active research. During this period he lived {{with his wife and two}} children at a small, isolated house in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In 1944 he was transferred to the Air Historical Branch based in Westminster, which allowed him and his family to relocate back to their Cambridge house in Barton Road. Clark used his daily commute from Cambridge into central London to edit articles submitted for the Proceedings. Although all meetings of the Prehistoric Society were cancelled for the duration of the war, Clark was able to keep the journal going despite paper rationing.|$|E

500|$|By 2006, {{archaeologists and}} {{historical}} researchers had determined {{the exact location}} of Fort Dobbs, and had located the post-hole foundations of the former log structure. Excavation began in 1967, and by 1968, the site of the fort was confirmed. In 1967, Stanley South, an archaeologist and proponent of processual archaeology, discovered that by overlaying a transparency depicting a survey of the Fort Dobbs site done in the mid-18th-century on a modern <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph,</b> evidence of the surveyed lines could still be discerned in the modern terrain. [...] Additionally, excavations revealed a moat that surrounded the blockouse, as well as trash in the moat contemporary with the fort. [...] Early archaeological work concentrated specifically on the moat and a depression called the [...] "cellar", which South believed served as a storage space {{in the middle of the}} fort grounds, and which later researchers believe was directly underneath the blockhouse. [...] Archaeological work has unearthed evidence of a palisade surrounding the blockhouse, in a similar fashion to other French and Indian War-era forts such as Fort Shirley near Heath, Massachusetts, and Fort Prince George.|$|E
500|$|The {{new stadium}} was {{described}} by club officials as [...] "the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle", [...] "miraculously built in just 82 days" [...] and [...] "the eighth wonder of the world".

The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was located adjacent to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. The author Simon Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising [...] "a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks".
