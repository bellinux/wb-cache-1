500|$|Rand {{acknowledged}} Aristotle as {{her greatest}} influence and remarked {{that in the}} history of philosophy she could only recommend [...] "three A's"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, [...] "Out of my own mind, with the sole <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself." [...] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a [...] "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} references to slaves {{that we have}} found in the notarial documents of 14 th- 15 th century Cervera, only one slave is identified as a Jew. This information is contained in two documents dating from 1450. The first is the signed <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt,</b> dated 26 th July, 1450, according to which Gentou Camiç states that he owes Guillem Marc, of Valmoll, one hundred florins, the sum agreed for the freeing of a Jewish slave {{by the name of}} Abraham Abenalbac, property of the said Guillem Marc. Payment of the 100 florins was to be made in September of that year, subject to the following conditions: if the slave died before payment was made, Gentou Camiç would only pay the slaves owner the sum resulting from donations made by the aljamas, or Jewish communities. In the event of Gentou Camiçs death, his heirs would likewise pay only that sum collected by the deceased in the form of donations. We therefore deduce that Gentou Camiç had taken responsibility for the Jewish slave so that he or the slave himself might request financial assistance from those Jewish communities that thought fit, in order to raise the sum that had been fixed on the slaves freedom. The same document includes an amendment dated 3 rd November, 1450, to the effect that Guillem Marc had cancelled the debt {{as a result of a}} new document. In fact, on that very day a text had been drawn up granting Abraham Abenalbac his freedom in exchange for seventy florins. Abraham Abenalbac came from the North African town of Fez, which had a sizeable and ancient Jewish community, and had been bought from Dionís Aimeric, a resident of Cervera. We also know that it was Abenalbac who had obtained the seventy florins from the Jewish communities of Catalonia and Aragon. In this case, the evident solidarity among the Jews of the kingdom of Catalonia-Aragon enabled one of their brethren, notwithstanding his North-African origins, to gather together the considerable sum of seventy florins necessary to buy his freedom. The article contains a transcript of the two Latin documents in question...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the French Civil code, the German Civil code {{belongs to}} the group of {{so-called}} anti-causalistic codifications, since it explicitly does not govern the issue of purpose (cause) of contract. Due to this very reason, the delineation between abstract and causal juridical acts gains special importance in German law. The German Civil Code governs a number of juridical acts and other acts of legal importance that are abstract in their nature. Among them the abstract nature of the promise to fulfill an obligation (Schuldversprechung) and the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> (Schuldannerkennung) is traditionally considered the most prominent. However, the relation to the purpose for which they are concluded is not entirely interrupted, since in the case of frustration of their purpose, any asset given to the other party is subject to restitution under the rules of unjustified enrichment. The fact that the issue of purpose of contract is not explicitly governed in the German Civil Code, does not lead to the conclusion, though, that it is legally irrelevant. It gains legal relevance in two different aspects: as a licit and as an illicit purpose. On the one hand, juridical acts concluded with the aim to achieve illicit purposes are considered void, for which the Code's sections on the general confines of the principle of freedom of contract serve the statutory basis - such juridical acts infringe the institution of 'good customs' (gute Sitten), usually referred to as public policy, while the performance of other factual or legal acts in order to achieve illicit purposes are sanctioned under the rules of unjustified enrichment. On the other hand, lawful purposes of the parties gain legal relevance in relation to a range of various institutions. Concerning some of them the Code itself contains formulations implying the necessity to ascertain the purpose of contract, while in other cases the case law and the doctrine have come to such conclusion. The determination of the purpose of contract in the context of these institutions either secures the fulfilment of the purpose of assumption of contractual obligation of one of the parties or rectifies the consequences of the frustration of the fulfilment of that purpose. In this range surely the most important institutions are the collapse of the basis of transac tion or frustration of purpose (Störung der Geschäftsgrundlage), a special case of discharge of contract due to impossibility, whereby the purpose of contract is realized without the performance of debtor's obligation, a special case of unjustified enrichment due to frustration of the result aimed by the purpose of the transaction and the invalidity of standard business terms that jeopardize the fulfillment of the purpose of contract...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I am {{concerned}} with the specific relationship between William Blake 2 ̆ 7 s Milton and James Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses. In chapter one, I excavate and examine Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep <b>debt</b> to Blake and especially to Milton through <b>a</b> long series <b>of</b> texts extending from his 1902 essay on James Clarence Mangan to selected passages of Finnegans Wake. These acknowledgements indicate that the ground of this debt was Blake 2 ̆ 7 s self-reflexive analysis within Milton of the formal and material properties of the written text. In chapter two, I review the contemporary theoretical debate on writing and intertextuality and adumbrate the relation of these areas of debate to Milton and Ulysses. My assumption throughout is that both Blake and Joyce saw a close relation between a writer 2 ̆ 7 s formal approach to language and his historical posture. In chapter three, I analyze writing and intertextuality in Milton and begin to extract the set of definable structural relations that are the basis of my collocation of Milton and Ulysses. In chapter four, I look first at <b>A</b> Portrait <b>of</b> the Artist as a Young Man because the earlier novel is Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s most lyrical and Romantic text and because he completed it at a crucial point in his relation to Blake. Then I examine four chapters of Ulysses. Two of these chapters, 2 ̆ 2 Proteus 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Sirens 2 ̆ 2, contain <b>an</b> extensive analysis <b>of</b> {{the structure of the}} written sign and its relation to other modes of communication. The other two, 2 ̆ 2 Scylla and Charybdis 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Cyclops 2 ̆ 2, present positive and negative structures of intertextuality. Milton, I maintain, was one of Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s intertextual sources for the analysis of Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s creative and erotic life in 2 ̆ 2 Scylla and Charybdis 2 ̆ 2, {{as well as for the}} overall borrowing and transforming of the narrative pattern of the Odyssey. I conclude by defining the set of linguistic and historical relations that link Milton and Ulysses...|$|R

Following the general introduction the recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> is described together with similar legal instruments. Then the thesis focuses on particular issues associated with the instrument <b>of</b> recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt,</b> such as methods of identification of the debt being recognized, relationship between recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> and set-off, ways of explicit and implicit recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> etc. The thesis emphasizes the judicial solutions of these issues and the respective doctrinal scrutiny. The commercial law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code) is of the main importance. If appropriate, the civil law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., the Civil Code) is used. As the New Civil Code repeals these laws, the thesis looks into the future and attempts to evaluate to what extent the recent conclusions of practice and theory will be applicable.
