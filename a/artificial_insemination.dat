40|$|Since early {{fertility}} decline {{is a permanent}} problem of broiler breeders, {{the aim of this}} study was to test the effects of various sex ratios, spiking strategies and additional <b>artificial</b> <b>inseminations</b> (AI) on their breeding efficiency. Six breeder flocks were analysed during the whole reproduction cycle. In Flock A the sex ratio was maintained at 10 % during the whole cycle (control), while in Flock B the number of males was increased to a final ratio of 16 %. In Flocks C (technological control), D, E and F the ratio of males was gradually decreased from 10 % to 6. 5 % until the end of the cycle. Moreover, at the age of 44 weeks in Flocks D and E 50 and 100 % of cockerels were replaced by young ones, respectively, while in Flock F additional <b>artificial</b> <b>inseminations</b> were applied in the second half of the reproduction cycle. The increase of sperm transport was successful only in Groups B (increase in male numbers) and D (50 % replacement of old cockerels with young ones); however, it was not sufficient for increasing the fertility rates in either group. Nor did additional <b>artificial</b> <b>inseminations</b> (Flock F) have an effect on fertility. As a conclusion, it can be established that increasing the sperm count in the hens’ oviducts in any way could not improve fertility in the last third of the production cycle. The results also suggest that the expensive and labour-intensive spiking technique used in broiler breeder management is useless. The prime factor responsible for the shortened persistence of fertility may be the reduced ability of the female oviduct to accept and store sperm...|$|R

These re-synchronization protocols may involve selected forms of hormonal intervention during the diestrus and pro-estrus periods following FTAI, or following pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound from 28 days after FTAI. Almost all programs involve strategically timed treatment of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).

5|$|Techniques such as <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> and embryo {{transfer}} are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product.

Two brothers showed hypotonia, mental retardation, ocular abnormalities with impaired vision and colobomas and a breathing pattern compatible with JBS. Neuroimaging revealed cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and ventriculomegaly. A tentative diagnosis of JBS was made, and autosomal recessive inheritance considered most likely. In a subsequent pregnancy that occurred after <b>artificial</b> donor <b>insemination,</b> ultrasound in the 22 nd week revealed a Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephaly.

All other health and production parameters [number of reproductive tract treatments, number of udder treatments, number of <b>artificial</b> <b>inseminations</b> (AIs), calving interval, and service period] were significantly better in the control group.
