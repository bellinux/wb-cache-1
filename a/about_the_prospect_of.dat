5|$|In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten {{was invited}} to a job {{interview}} by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark. Britten was not enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what {{came out of the}} interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.|$|E
5|$|Inquiries {{were made}} through {{official}} channels <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> Murphy attending West Point upon {{his return to the}} United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau of Standards, Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E

25|$|Mozart {{received}} the libretto from Stephanie on 29 July 1781.

He was not especially successful in selling the cars, and felt that one problem lay in the car's styling. Saidel wrote to the factory and suggested that the next model be styled as a fastback.|$|E
25|$|Foote was {{enthusiastic}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> using gunboats for reconnaissance, {{and promptly}} made preparations in January, 1863 to further navigate the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The {{idea of using}} gunboats for river reconnaissance was before this time a novel idea whose tactics were not thoroughly tested, and {{it was important to}} make careful reconnaissance trips, without arousing any suspicion of what was being planned. It was also uncertain how ironclads would fare against land-batteries at close range. Another of these expeditions was conducted on January 7, which was logged and reported by Lieutenant Phelps of the Conestoga.|$|E

40|$|Although John Stuart Mill places {{considerable}} {{emphasis on}} three information signalling devices – debate, votes and prices – he remains curiously sceptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> institutional or social epistemology. In this paper, I explore Mill's modest scepticism about institutional epistemolog y and {{compare and contrast}} that with the attitudes of liberal theorists such as F. A. Hayek and John Dewey who are much more enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> social epistemology {{as part of their}} defences of liberalism. The paper examines the extent to which Hayek and Dewey ignore concerns originally raised by Mill. I conclude that Mill's modest scepticism is reflected in the epistemological abstinence of contemporary liberal philosophers such as John Rawls, and that his elevation of philosophy over democracy remains a challenge to contemporary defenders of the political value of social or institutional epistemology...|$|R

25|$|However, a {{great deal}} of {{collaboration}} came to exist between the Liberal Party and the leaders of the labour movement, though Marx saw these as effective bribes by the bourgeoisie and the government. The 1867 Reform Act passed and enfranchised roughly three million people, around half of whom were working class. This was extended to five million by the Representation of the People Act 1884, which extended the householder's franchise. The Liberal Party was worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> a socialist party taking the bulk of the working-class vote, while their great rivals the Conservatives initiated occasional intrigues to encourage socialist candidates to stand against the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|On July, 2016, {{after the}} failed Turkish coup d'état attempt Greek {{authorities}} {{on a number}} of Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey, the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup. At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced. Also, the mayor of Kos, expressed concern {{in a letter to the}} Greek Prime Minister sighting the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup. The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.|$|E
25|$|Alberto Guglielmotti gives a more {{detailed}} account of the battle. He states that Dragut had time to embark his crews on seeing the 7 vessels sent ahead by Doria, and that, leaving behind 2 galleys to guard the booty, he sailed to engage Giorgio Doria's force with his 9 remaining galleys. Expecting to fight with superior numbers, Dragut sailed into the ambush laid by Doria and Requesens, whose remaining 15 galleys appeared from the west {{taking advantage of the}} windward. Dragut then tried to escape by turning around his ships, but as the Spanish galleys came under his stern, he decided to try to break through them. Then, however, a single shot from Gianettino's galley bow gun inflicted serious damage to his flagship that she nearly sank. Losing hope <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> escaping, most of the Ottoman seamen and soldiers jumped overboard to gain the beach and save themselves inland.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-20th century, wine {{production}} in the Barolo zone was dominated by large negociants who purchased grapes and wines from across the zone and blended it into a house style. In the 1960s, individual proprietors began estate bottling and producing single vineyard wines from their holdings. By the 1980s, {{a wide range of}} single vineyard bottlings were available, which led to a discussion among the region's producers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> developing a Cru classification for the area's vineyards. The cataloging of Barolo's vineyards has a long history dating back to the work of Lorenzo Fantini in the late 19th century and Renato Ratti and Luigi Veronelli in the late 20th century, but as of 2009 there is still no official classification within the region. However, in 1980 the region as a whole was elevated to DOCG status. Along with Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo {{was one of the first}} Italian wine regions to attain this designation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō opened the war with a {{surprise}} torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the Tsesarevich and Retvizan, the heaviest battleships in Russia's far Eastern theater, and the 6,600ton cruiser Pallada. These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral Tōgō was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially {{after the death of}} Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.|$|E
25|$|Smaïl-aga's {{contribution}} to the Ottoman victory at Grahovo {{was so great that}} the Porte had granted him a personal fiefdom that stretched from Gacko to Kolašin and was larger than all the Montenegrin-held territories combined. These land acquisitions were met with much trepidation by Smaïl-aga's fellow beys, who feared that his rise would threaten their hold on power. In 1839, Serbia's Prince Miloš sent a letter to Ali Pasha informing him that Smaïl-aga would conspire with the Porte to have him removed as vizier of Herzegovina. Ali Pasha promptly wrote to Njegoš, asking that he arrange for Smaïl-aga's murder. He felt that Njegoš—who held Smaïl-aga primarily responsible for the slaughter at Grahovo—would be enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> avenging his kinsmen. Ali Pasha also reasoned that by allowing the Montenegrins to kill the ambitious Herzegovinian bey he would be deflecting suspicion from himself, as the Montenegrins had more than enough reason to want Smaïl-aga dead. In mid-1839, Njegoš began exchanging letters with Smaïl-aga. The letters made it seem that he had forgiven Smaïl-aga for the deaths, and were meant to lull him into a false sense of security.|$|E
