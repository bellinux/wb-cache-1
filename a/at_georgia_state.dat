5|$|By {{relying on}} the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> University, asserts that the largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography. His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its Oromo population {{and the fact that the}} Cushitic-speaking Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved in maintaining the cultural, political, and military institutions of the Christian state.|$|E

In addition to the college campuses, enlisted WAVES also trained <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> College for Women in Milledgeville; Burdett College in Boston, and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The Bureaus of Aeronautics and Medicine opened their doors to enlisted WAVES. The training in aeronautics took place at naval air stations and training centers; the training for medical technicians {{was held at the}} National Medical and Great Lakes Training Centers.

Maryland Terrapins head coach Lefty Driesell began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12:03a.m. on 15 October 1971 by inviting the public to a 1.5 mile team run. The early practice session was attended by 3,000 fans at the track surrounding Byrd Stadium on the University of Maryland campus. Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland, and brought the tradition {{with him when he}} became head coach <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> University.

2500|$|In late 2014, ISIL {{released}} a pamphlet {{that focused on}} the treatment of female slaves. It claims that the Quran allows fighters to have sex with captives, including adolescent girls, and to beat slaves as discipline. The pamphlet's guidelines also allow fighters to trade slaves, including for sex, {{as long as they have}} not been impregnated by their owners. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the counter-extremist think tank Quilliam, described the pamphlet as [...] "abhorrent". In response to this document Abbas Barzegar, a religion professor <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> University, said Muslims around the world find ISIL's [...] "alien interpretation of Islam grotesque and abhorrent". Muslim leaders and scholars from around the world have rejected the validity of ISIL's claims, claiming that the reintroduction of slavery is un-Islamic, that they are required to protect [...] "People of the Scripture" [...] including Christians, Jews, Muslims and Yazidis, and that ISIL's fatwas are invalid due to their lack of religious authority and the fatwas' inconsistency with Islam.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Geldof, {{then the}} lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, read about the {{incident}} when a news story about it came off the telex at WRAS, the campus radio station <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> University in Atlanta. He was particularly struck by Spencer's claim that she did it {{because she did not}} like Mondays, and began writing a song about it, also incorporating the reporters' [...] "Tell me why?", called [...] "I Don't Like Mondays". It was released in July 1979 and was number 1 for four weeks in the UK, and was the band's biggest hit in their native Ireland. Although it did not make the Top 40 in the U.S. it still received extensive radio airplay (outside of the San Diego area) despite the Spencer family's efforts to prevent it. Geldof has later mentioned that [...] " [...] wrote to me saying she was glad she'd done it because I'd made her famous, which is not a good thing to live with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevenson {{described}} as the leitmotif of his career his interest in why one person would develop one disease, and another something different. He {{came to believe that}} neither environment nor heredity could account for certain fears, illnesses and special abilities, and that some form of personality or memory transfer might provide a third type of explanation. He acknowledged, however, the absence of evidence of a physical process by which a personality could survive death and transfer to another body, and he was careful not to commit himself fully to the position that reincarnation occurs. He argued only that his case studies could not, in his view, be explained by environment or heredity, and that [...] "reincarnation is the best – even though not the only – explanation for the stronger cases we have investigated." [...] His position was not a religious one, but represented what Robert Almeder, professor emeritus of philosophy <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> University, calls the minimalistic reincarnation hypothesis. Almeder states the hypothesis this way: ...|$|E

She guest-starred as herself on the CBS sitcom Murphy Brown in 1992 and in the NBC sitcom Will & Grace in late 2002. On May 12, 2003, she traded places for a day with Tonight Show host Jay Leno. Couric also co-hosted NBC's live coverage of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1991 until 2005.

2500|$|The Florida State Soccer/Softball Complex {{was opened}} with a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} Saturday, April 17, 1999. The event, which was held in conjunction with Florida State's 30th Anniversary of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics Spring Celebration. JoAnne Graf Field hosted back-to-back NCAA Regionals in 2001 and 2002 and then again in 2004 and 2009. Known as one of NCAA softball's best venues, JoAnne Graf Field is a modernized field of play that caters quite well to student-athletes, coaches, fans and other spectators. Since opening in 1999, Florida State has played to the venue's home-field advantage. The Seminoles have recorded 384 victories in their 15 years at JoAnne Graf Field. Two major changes {{were made to the}} complex in the mid 2000s. On April 2, 2005, former university president Dr. T.K. Wetherell and former Athletics Director, Dave Hart, officially renamed the softball stadium [...] "JoAnne Graf Field at the Seminole Softball Complex." [...] She joined Bob Heck <b>at</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>State</b> as the only two active softball coaches with fields named after them. It was only fitting that one day later Graf crossed the 1,300-win plateau with a 5–2 triumph over Virginia Tech. In the fall of 2006, the stadium got a facelift as a Florida State unveiled a brand new video scoreboard for the 2007 season. The team building underwent a multi-million dollar renovation to the second floor which began in October 2008. The expansion to the second floor now includes new offices, a team meeting room, tradition space for both softball and soccer and a player lounge. In 2011 when a new indoor batting facility was constructed. Approaching nearly 12,000 square feet, the brand-new feature is unique and aesthetically pleasing. It is a two-story facility that includes a large bullpen, hitting nets and a wide area on the top floor for stretching and other softball activities. Another recent addition to the field was the installation of new wall padding in 2013.|$|E
