So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{history of}} this 9th century CE Insular/Anglo-Saxon manuscript after its production is equally speculative. However, the existing evidence {{seems to suggest that}} at some point after its production in the later 9th and early 10th centuries this codex may have been subsequently relocated somewhere in unoccupied Mercia, presumably Worcester, or even Wessex. This evacuation, along with other ecclesiastical manuscripts, was to provide <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>environment</b> or repository to protect the book from potential Viking raids and incursions.|$|E

25|$|Largely due to {{concerns}} over a government- or police-operated system of cameras, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) organized and was {{registered with the}} Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004.

25|$|The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was {{the first}} {{government}} to legalize abortion and make it available on request, often for no cost. The Soviet government hoped {{to provide access to}} abortion in <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>environment</b> performed by a trained doctor instead of babki. While this campaign was extremely effective in the urban areas (as much as 75% of abortions in Moscow were performed in hospitals by 1925), it had much less on rural regions where there was neither access to doctors, transportation, or both and where women relied on traditional medicine. In the countryside in particular, women continued to see babki, midwives, hairdressers, nurses, and others for the procedure after abortion was legalized in the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|While other {{countries}} seem {{to use these}} spots to create <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>environment</b> for women, there has been controversy across the media in regards to sexism, since China {{is the only country}} that has made these spots significantly bigger. At the Wonder Mall in Hebei, there is an entire parking garage reserved for women, which contains spaces that were 80 centimeters larger than regular parking spaces. If women have trouble parking in the significantly bigger lots, there are dancing parking-lot employees designated to park the cars for them. The walls in the women-only parking garage are designed with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac/horoscope as a precaution for female drivers who can remember a picture better than a parking space number.|$|E

25|$|One main {{factor that}} {{influences}} {{the ability for}} a driver-less automobiles to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with {{a map of the}} area being driven.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings. Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>environment</b> for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.|$|E
