50|$|A {{study of}} the {{deregulation}} of taxis in Sweden in 1991 showed that the taxicab supply increased, but <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> also increased in almost all cases. Specifically, <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> per hour increased for all trips. <b>Average</b> <b>fares</b> also increased for fares calculated by distance (per kilometer) in almost every category studied - for all customer-paid trips in municipalities of all 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and increased for municipality-paid trips in small and large municipalities; fares only decreased for municipality-paid trips in medium-sized municipalities that were calculated per kilometer. Deregulation also resulted in decreased taxicab productivity and decreased taxi-company revenues. This study concluded that deregulation resulted in increased fares especially in rural areas and the authors argued that the increased fares were due to low taxi company revenues after deregulation.|$|R

This was challenged in court, the GLC lost and fares doubled in 1982. The fare zones were retained and fares dropped slightly the following year. In 1983 the Travelcard allowed travel within the specified zones on buses and underground trains, and was followed in Capitalcard in 1985 that included British Rail services.

These carried 215,000 vehicles and 750,000 passengers. At its peak, Silver City operated 222 daily ferry flights across the English Channel, as well as between Scotland and Ireland and to/from the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Cross-Channel flights to France operated between 7.30 am and 11.00 pm. The <b>average</b> <b>fare</b> was £25 per car and £4 per passenger. This was furthermore the time the Air Kruise cross-Channel services, as well as all Dragon Airways, Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and Manx Airlines operations from Newcastle upon Tyne, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were transferred to Silver City's new Northern Division to streamline BAS's fragmented airline operations. It was hoped that these measures would improve BAS's financial performance.|$|E

In {{the early years of the}} 21st century, London Underground was reorganised in a public–private partnership where private companies upgraded and maintained the infrastructure. In 2003 control passed to Transport for London (TfL), which had been opposed to the arrangement and, following financial failure of the infrastructure companies, had taken full responsibility by 2010. The contactless Oyster card first went on sale in 2003. The East London line closed in 2007 to be converted into a London Overground line, and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith. Currently there is an upgrade programme to increase capacity on several Underground lines, and work is under way on a Northern line extension to Battersea.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of flight {{reductions}} and disciplined airline capacity management strategies on average one-way domestic airfares at 445 U.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the price policy adopted by easyJet, the second most {{relevant}} low-cost carrier in Europe. The paper builds on a dataset including the fares of all easyJet flights from 2006 to 2012. For each flight, we measure <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> and dynamic pricing activities over a period of 90 days before departure. Those price information are first regressed to a set of explanatory variables relating to routes, airports, served territories and competition. Preliminary results show a positive correlation between the average price of each route and its length and the frequency. We also find a significant negative correlation between competition, measured both on a direct and indirect base, and <b>average</b> <b>fares.</b> With reference to the intensity of the dynamic pricing activities, the correlation to route length and the frequency of flights is negative. We find that greater competition also comes with higher discounts given on advance bookings. We compare our results with those obtained by literature analysing other major European low-cost carriers. The second part of the paper deals with the developments observed in the easyJet fares strategy regarding both <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> and discounts for advanced bookings. We find different fare reactions to the 2009 and 2012 crisis in the European air transport industry...|$|R

We then use a competitive airline market simulation to illustrate the importance of often ignored factors – revenue management and the flows of connecting network passengers on the flight legs affected by low-fare entry – in explaining the effects of entry on these aggregate measures of airline performance.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the evolution of domestic Origin- Destination (O-D) traffic and fares at the Top 200 airports in the United States between 1990 and 2008. The impetus behind this research is {{to shed light on}} the differences in trends between the largest and smallest, primary and secondary, hub and non-hub airports, and to measure the impact of Low Cost carriers (LCC) on traffic, fares and competition. Furthermore, case studies of five multi-airport systems located within major US metropolitan areas were performed to identify the trends shaping multi-airport systems. We find that domestic O-D passenger traffic at the Top 200 commercial airports in the United States increased by more than 52 % between 1990 and 2005, but dropped by 2 % from 2005 to 2008 because of the global economic downturn. <b>Average</b> <b>fares</b> at the Top 200 airports increased by 14 % during the "golden 90 s", decreased by 13 % between 2000 and 2005, but rebounded by 16 % between 2005 and 2008, as a result of soaring jet fuel prices and reduced capacity. Low Cost carriers' share of the total domestic O-D traffic in the US is still growing, although leveling off, reaching 34 % in 2008. LCC entry focused initially on largest airports, then grew rapidly in second and third airport tiers. As a result, in 2008, 95 of the Top 200 airports had an LCC aggregated market share greater than 20 %, up from 27 airports in 1990. We show that LCC's effective entrance or substantial growth at a particular airport had a significant impact lowering <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> and stimulating passenger volumes. However in recent years, this market stimulation effect has been leveling off, as the gap in <b>average</b> <b>fares</b> between LCC and Network Legacy carriers (NLC) has narrowed. Secondary airports {{played a critical role in}} accommodating the increase in demand for air traffic in the nation's largest metropolitan areas: They served 19. 8 % of the total domestic O-D passenger traffic in the 15 studied multi-airport systems in 2008, compared to 16. 9 % in 1990, highlighting their increasing importance. Finally, the airport concentration levels, as measured by the average weighted Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, increased by 8 % during the studied period, demonstrating that the Top 200 -airport sample is more concentrated in 2008 compared to 1990. by Mehdi Ben Abda.
