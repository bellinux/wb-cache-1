Eight generations of three crosses involved three parental lines were evaluated for disease incidence (percentage of infected plants) and disease severity under natural occurrence of PBNV infection in a randomized complete block design with six replications. Evaluations were carried out at 30, 40, 50 and 60 Days After Planting (DAP). The analysis followed Hayman’s model and Gamble’s notations were used to describe parameters of gene effects. Joint scaling test was used to determine adequacy of the model. <b>Additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effect</b> was the most important contribution to genetic variation in generation means for both disease incidence and disease severity in the cross ICGV 86388 x IC 10.

40|$|Generation mean {{analysis}} (GMA) {{was used}} to study the type of gene action and inheritance of grain yield and its components. Generation mean analysis with joint scaling test was performed. This research was conducted at research farm of college of Agriculture at the University of Tehran. The parents and their progenies (F 1, F 2, BC 1 & BC 2) in three mating groups (Sardari × 7007, Sardari × 7107 & 7107 × 5593) were produced and planted using a randomized complete block design with four replications for each mating group. Of four replications in each experiment, two replications for drought and two replications for non-drought condition were used. The eight traits which were evaluated included grain yield, plant height, plant weight, tiller number, spike length, grains per spikes and 100 grain weight. Most of the genetic parameters including mean (m), additive (d), dominant (h), additive × additive [i], additive × dominant [j], and dominant × dominant[l] effects were significant. However, all gene effects were not significant in all traits. The dominant gene effect was the most contributor factor to inheritance {{of the majority of}} traits. For the majority of the traits, <b>additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effect</b> was significant, but its magnitude was less than dominant gene effect. Also the dominant × dominant[l] epistasis was more important than additive× additive [i] epistasis. The degree of dominance in most of traits indicated the predominance of dominant gene effects...|$|E
40|$|Four dry bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{adapted to}} the {{southern}} region {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil, were crossed with five exotic cultivars according to a partial diallel design. The nine parents and twenty hybrid population, were tested in six experiment in fully randomized blocks. In one of the experiments, the segregation populations were in the F 2 generation. Trials were held at two locations in the state of Minas Gerais and at one location in the state of Goias in 1986. All twenty nine-genetic materials showed heterogeneity concerning grain yield in all trials, with cultivars having a greater effect (<b>additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effect)</b> than heterosis (dominance effect), especially in the more advanced generations. No interactions between cultivar x generation effects and cultivar heterosis x generation effects were observed at any location. However, cultivar and cultivar heterosis x locations were significant, suggesting that the choice of segregating populations for genetic improvement of commons beans should be based on the performance of the populations at the locations where they will be used, but disregarding generation. In this way, because of larger quantities of seed, the material can be evaluated in the F 4 generation. Despite components of means x location interactions, the population ESAL 501 x A 354 was the most promissing for selection based on grain yield because of the general combining ability of its parents and of grain quality. 198...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the synchrony in the maturity of mungbean and to study the correlation in days to flowering and pod maturity in two diverse mungbean genotypes through induced mutagenesis. The mungbean genotype K 851 was the best combiner for early flowering and early pod maturity where as accession Sona was the best general combiner for more synchrony in pod maturity. The best specific combination for early flowering and early pod maturity was in K 851 and for highest synchrony in pod maturity was in Sona. Degree of indetermination (DDd) was controlled by both <b>additive</b> and dominance <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> with predominant effect of additive component. Only <b>additive</b> and dominance <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> controlled the days to first flower (DDd 1) and degree of indetermination from first pod maturity to 90 % pod maturity (DDd 2), respectively. The high narrow and broad sense heritability for days to first flower, days to first pod maturity and 90 % pod maturity revealed more proportion of their genetic variation due to <b>additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effects.</b> The selection for synchrony in pod maturity is suggested to be made in advanced generation due to the low narrow sense heritability for degree of indetermination from first flower to 90 % pod maturity...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{action and}} {{components}} of variance analysis {{were made in}} a 6 X 6 diallel cross in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). <b>Additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were more important for all the traits. Complete dominance for yield plant - 1 and spike length and over dominance for tillers plant - 1 was observed. While plant height, spikelets spike - 1, grains spike - 1 and 1000 -grain weight exhibited partial dominance. Dominant alleles were more frequent in parents for all characters except plant height and 1000 -grain weight. Durum wheat genotypes, Altar 84 and Bittern "s" showed relatively higher combining ability...|$|R
40|$|Breeding for drought {{resistance}} in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{has been done}} primarily based on empirical selection for yield under drought stress conditions, but progress has been slow. Selection for physiological traits that can contribute to superior performance of the crop under drought stress conditions may complement conventional approach and hasten the progress. Specific leaf area (SLA) and Harvest index (HI) are physiological traits {{that could be used}} for this purpose. For the choice of an efficient breeding procedure, a good knowledge on the types of gene action controlling the expression of these two traits is needed. This study was conducted to examine the various <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> for SLA and HI in three crosses of peanut (ICGV 86388 x IC 10, ICGV 86388 x KK 60 - 1 and IC 10 x KK 60 - 1). Seven generations of individual crosses (parents, F 1, F 2, F 3, BC 11 S and BC 12 S) were grown in a group balance block experiment with six replications. Data were analyzed following a generation means analysis. The results showed that <b>additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were predominant in determining the expression of SLA and HI in all the three crosses, accounting for 80 - 95 % of total genetic variability for SLA and 63 - 73 % for HI. Dominant <b>gene</b> <b>effect</b> for SLA was significant in one cross but its contribution was very small. Significant additive x dominant epistatic effects were also observed for SLA in all crosses, but additive x additive and dominant x dominant <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were significant in one cross each. Significant epistatic <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> for HI were also detected in two crosses but largely being additively x additive which is fixable. The predominance of <b>additive</b> <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> for SLA and HI suggested that selection for the two traits in these crosses would be effective even in early segregating generations...|$|R
