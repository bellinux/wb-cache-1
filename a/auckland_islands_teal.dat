5000|$|The Auckland teal or <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas aucklandica) is {{a species}} of dabbling duck of the genus Anas that is endemic to Auckland Islands south of New Zealand. The species was once found {{throughout}} the Auckland Islands but is now restricted to the islands that lack introduced predators: Adams Island, Enderby Island, Disappointment Island and a few smaller islands. An old report of [...] "the same flightless duck" [...] on North East Island, The Snares group most likely refers to a straggler.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} in the {{northeast}} of the group, in the mouth of Port Ross, Auckland Island and south west of the larger Enderby Island. It was stocked with rabbits and provided with a boatshed for the relief of castaways during the nineteenth century. The rabbits have since been eradicated by the Department of Conservation, and provides a secure home for a population of <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>teal.</b> The vegetation on Rose contains rata, and while much original vegetation has been destroyed, it is less modified than much of the Auckland Islands.|$|E
40|$|Recovery {{options are}} {{suggested}} for two endangered endemic species of waterfowl: the <b>Auckland</b> <b>Island</b> and Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>teals.</b> The distribution of both species {{is presumed to}} have been significantly reduced since the introduction of predators and competitors to each island group. The recommended recovery options for Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> will, when achieved, establish at least three populations of this species compared to the one population at present and will advance the prospects of returning it to Campbell Island in the future. The recovery strategy outlined for <b>Auckland</b> <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> will maintain the present situation until management techniques allow for their return to the whole of their former range.

40|$|Mitochondrial 12 S rRNA {{sequence}} {{data were}} {{used to examine the}} taxonomic status of the endemic brown, <b>Auckland</b> <b>Island,</b> and Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>teal.</b> Based on phylogenetic reconstructions using the 12 S rRNA data we have found that the Great Barrier <b>Island</b> brown <b>teal,</b> and the <b>Auckland</b> and Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>teals</b> form a discrete clade, to the exclusion of the Fiordland brown teal. All of the Fiordland brown teal sequenced show striking similarity to grey duck and mallard sequences, with which they group. It therefore seems extremely likely that the Fiordland population of brown teal have at sometime in the past hybridised extensively with these invading species. 1...|$|R
40|$|Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> (Anas nesiotis) are a {{critically}} endangered species. The wild population {{in its natural}} range may be less than 30, although a captive breeding programme {{has raised more than}} 60 birds and the species is safe from extinction in the short to medium term. Due to the isolation of, and the difficulty of access to, Dent Island in the Campbell Group, the sole surviving natural habitat, no detailed study of the behaviour and ecology of Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> in the wild has been undertaken. Although observations have been made of captive birds, the release of Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> onto Codfish <b>Island</b> (Whenua Hou Nature Reserve) provided the first opportunity to carry out a detailed ecological study of this species in the wild. Aspects of the ecology of Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> (Anas nesiotis) were studied following two releases onto Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000, in order to assess the success of the releases in establishing a new population. A programme was designed to monitor the attempt to establish a self sustaining population of <b>teal</b> on Codfish <b>Island,</b> and to record how captive bred birds adapted to life in the wild by observing characteristics and behaviours of the teal that allowed them to establish a successful population. This information will be used to increase the chances of any future release of this species onto Campbell Island succeeding. Birds were released at two sites on Codfish Island, with different sex and age ratios released in April 1999 and May 2000. The survival and dispersal of these birds was monitored using radio transmitters, with direct observations made on their behaviour and ecology. In these respects, Campbell <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> were found to be most similar to the <b>Auckland</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> (Anas aucklandica). During the three years of this study 24 birds were released, with individuals being monitored from one to three years. Forty two eggs were laid in 13 nesting attempts by eight different females, resulting in 36 ducklings hatched and 17 fledged. Only four adults are known to have died during this period although 11 other birds could not be located {{at the end of the}} study. The dispersal of the birds from their release sites varied greatly, probably influenced by habitat quality, although this was not quantified. While the inability to track some individuals may mean that dispersal was greater than recorded, of those birds which could be tracked, juvenile males dispersed the farthest with three individuals moving more than 3 km after fledging. Hatching and fledging success were influenced by the age of the females and it appears that environmental factors, especially availability of suitable damp feeding areas for ducklings, were the main factors affecting fledging success. The dispersal of the teal, their habitat preferences and breeding success provide guidelines on where birds should be released on Campbell Island and the optimum age of birds to be released. The high adult survival rate and productivity of the captive bred birds indicates that, providing sufficient are released, the teal should establish rapidly on Campbell Island...|$|R

40|$|Measurements {{of major}} bones from three island populations (New Zealand mainland, <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands,</b> Chatham Island) of extinct mergansers {{presently}} known as Mergus australis indicate that birds from Chatham Island differed {{in size and}} proportion from those at <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands.</b> The Chatham Island specimens were smaller overall, with a shorter skull, relatively shorter premaxilla, smaller sternum and keel, relatively shorter wing bones and a narrower pelvis. These differences support its taxonomic recognition as the new species, Mergus milleneri, described in this paper. Determining reliably {{the magnitude of the}} size differences of major bones between mergansers from mainland New Zealand and <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> or Chatham Island was not possible due to inadequate samples of these sexually dimorphic taxa. However, mainland mergansers may also have been smaller than <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> birds. Based on these measurements, Holocene fossils of mergansers on New Zealand’s mainland therefore are considered to be Mergus sp. indeterminate and we recommend that Mergus australis henceforth be called the <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> Merganser...|$|R
