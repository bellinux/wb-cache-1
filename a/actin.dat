5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as <b>actin</b> nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates <b>actin</b> polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. <b>Actin</b> nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an <b>actin</b> filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with <b>actin</b> monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated <b>actin</b> networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional <b>actin</b> cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit <b>actin</b> polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the <b>actin</b> filament.|$|E
5|$|Arp2/3 {{complex is}} a seven-subunit protein complex that {{plays a major}} role in the {{regulation}} of the <b>actin</b> cytoskeleton. It is a major component of the <b>actin</b> cytoskeleton and is found in most <b>actin</b> cytoskeleton-containing eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 complex {{simultaneously}} controls nucleation of <b>actin</b> polymerization and branching of filaments. Moreover, autocatalysis {{is observed}} during Arp2/3-mediated <b>actin</b> polymerization. In this process, {{the newly formed}} filaments activate other Arp2/3 complexes, facilitating the formation of branched filaments.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{tolerance of}} monomeric a-actin proteins from the deep-sea fish Coryphaenoides armatus and C. yaquinae {{was compared to}} that of non-deep-sea fish C. acrolepis, carp, and rabbit/human/chicken <b>actins</b> using molecular dynamics simulations at 0. 1 and 60 MPa. The amino acid sequences of <b>actins</b> are highly conserved across a variety of species. The <b>actins</b> from C. armatus and C. yaquinae have the specific substitutions Q 137 K/V 54 A and Q 137 K/L 67 P, respectively, relative to C. acrolepis, and are pressure tolerant to depths of at least 6000 m. At high pressure, we observed significant changes in the salt bridge patterns in deep-sea fish <b>actins,</b> and these changes are expected to stabilize ATP binding and subdomain arrangement. Salt bridges between ATP and K 137, formed in deep-sea fish <b>actins,</b> are expected to stabilize ATP binding even at high pressure. At high pressure, deep-sea fish <b>actins</b> also formed a greater total number of salt bridges than non-deep-sea fish <b>actins</b> owing to the formation of inter-helix/strand and inter-subdomain salt bridges. Free energy analysis suggests that deep-sea fish <b>actins</b> are stabilized to a greater degree by the conformational energy decrease associated with pressure effect...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial <b>actins,</b> in {{contrast}} to their eukaryotic counterparts, are highly divergent proteins whose wideranging functions are thought to correlate with their evolutionary diversity. One clade, represented by the MamK protein of magnetotactic bacteria, {{is required for the}} subcellular organization of magnetosomes, membrane-bound organelles that aid in navigation along the earth’s magnetic field. Using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1, we find that, like traditional <b>actins,</b> MamK forms dynamic filaments that require an intact NTPase motif for their turnover in vivo. We also uncover two proteins, MamJ and LimJ, which perform a redundant function to promote the dynamic behaviour of MamK filaments in wild-type cells. The absence of both MamJ and LimJ leads to static filaments, a disrupted magnetosome chain, and an anomalous build-up of cytoskeletal filaments between magnetosomes. Our results suggest that MamK filaments, like eukaryotic <b>actins,</b> are intrinsically stable and rely on regulators for their dynamic behaviour, a feature that stands {{in contrast}} to some classes of bacterial <b>actins</b> characterized to date...|$|R
5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric <b>actin</b> and serve as nucleation sites for new <b>actin</b> filaments. The complex binds {{to the sides of}} existing ("mother") filaments and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched <b>actin</b> networks are created {{as a result of this}} nucleation of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the <b>actin</b> cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E

5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, {{which is}} {{normally}} used to move organelles inside the cell.

5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and <b>actin.</b> When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on <b>actin.</b> The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E

50|$|GPR99 is {{inhibited}} by montelukast, {{a well-known}} and clinically useful inhibitor of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1); this drug binds to CysLTR1 thereby blocking the binding and action of LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4. It {{is presumed to}} act similarly to block the <b>actins</b> of these cystienyl leukotrienes on GPR99. It is not known if other CysLTR1 inhibitors (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Clinical significance) can mimic montelukast in blocking GPR99.|$|R
25|$|Nucleating {{factors are}} {{necessary}} to stimulate <b>actin</b> polymerization. One such nucleating factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a G-actin dimer in order to stimulate the nucleation (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric G-actin. The Arp2/3 complex binds to <b>actin</b> filaments at 70 degrees to form new <b>actin</b> branches off existing <b>actin</b> filaments. Arp2/3-mediated nucleation is necessary for directed cell migration. Also, <b>actin</b> filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Low {{level of}} <b>actin</b> in the nucleus {{seems to be}} very important, because <b>actin</b> has two nuclear export signals (NES) into its sequence.

40|$|Cytokeratins are {{a set of}} 19 {{proteins}} that together constitute the class of intermediate filament protein expressed by epithelial cells and tumors. Using a panel of 9 different monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies, the authors have performed immunocytochemistry on methanol-fixed, frozen sections and methacarn-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of human myometrial specimens. Anomalous cytokeratin expression (ACE) by smooth muscle cells was found in all specimens. Immunoblots of this tissue confirmed the presence of cytokeratin 19, and possibly 8. In addition, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated ACE in human fetal tissues within the intestinal muscularis and the heart, especially {{in the region of}} the aortic outflow tract, and in 8 of 19 cases of leiomyosarcoma from adults. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were also performed on cells explanted from myometrial tissue; the overwhelming majority of cells derived from these cultures were smooth muscle cells as verified by expression of muscle <b>actins,</b> and a subpopulation of these cells was found to be cytokeratin-positive. ACE was confirmed in vitro by double labeling experiments demonstrating simultaneous expression of muscle <b>actins</b> and cytokeratins within the same cell. The significance of this smooth muscle cell ACE is unknown, but it may be a phenotypic marker of smooth muscle in a proliferative state.

Nearly 75 % of the protein-coding genes are located in the AT-rich segments of the genome, but the biological significance of the GC-rich regions is not well understood. Based on an observation that the bee miRNAs, <b>actins</b> and tubulins are located in the GC-rich segments, this work investigated whether other highly conserved genomic regions show similar preferences. Sequences ultraconserved between the genomes of honeybee and Nasonia, another hymenopteran insect, were determined.

In this study, we show that the conditional and/or ectopic expression of a nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF 4 α), triggers microvillus morphogenesis. We also demonstrate that HNF 4 α expression induces ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP 50) expression and that attenuation of EBP 50 using RNA interference inhibits microvillus development. We conclude that HNF 4 α acts as a morphogen to trigger microvillus formation...|$|R

25|$|After {{spending}} his postdoctoral period in America, Perry returned to Cambridge. Using his expertise in manipulating muscle tissue combined with his biochemical knowledge, {{he was able}} to isolate myofibril in an uncontracted state, and from that {{he was able to}} characterize their protein components. Further observation of the myofibrils, and the crude preparations of the extracted contractile protein <b>actins</b> and myosins taken from them, showed that they required trace levels of calcium for contractile activity. Perry then used the calcium chelator EGTA to confirm that calcium was essential for the regulation of muscle contraction. This was a major breakthrough in the understanding of how muscle contractions are regulated. Seven years later Setsuro Ebashi, identified the factor responsible for calcium sensitivity in muscles, which he called troponin.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the transitions of bacterial <b>actins</b> between monomeric and filamentous states (Ozyamak et al., 2013 a). For instance, MamK proteins from MS- 1 and MSR- 1 polymerize into filaments in vitro with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (ATP-γ-S) as the optimal substrate (Sonkaria et al., 2012; Taoka et al., 2007). In contrast, AMB- 1 MamK with a His tag polymerized {{in the absence of}} nucleotides (Rioux et al., 2010), but untagged proteins efficiently assembled into filaments in the presence of ATP (Ozyamak et al., 2013 b). Because the MamK proteins investigated in previous studies were more than 94 % identical, the his tags used in different studies could alter the assembly behaviours of MamK proteins (Ozyamak et al., 2013 b). Although Mcas MamK has a relatively low identity (~ 40 %) to Magnetospirillum MamK, TEM observations showed that tags could significantly affect Mcas MamK filamentous structures (Fig. S 3). Different assembly properties have also been observed for untagged and his-tagged MreB from T. maritima (Bean and Amann, 2008). Additionally, despite the broad hydrolysis of various nucleotides, Mcas MamK only assembled well in the presence of ATP. No filament was detected with GTP, and only irregularly shaped filaments were formed with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (ATP-γ-S or AMP-PNP) (Fig. S 2). However, many bacterial <b>actins,</b> including ParM (Rivera et al., 2011), MreB (Mayer and Amann, 2009; Ent et al., 2001) and AlfA (Popp et al., 2010), could polymerize with ATP, GTP or analogues. Indeed, recent studies have revealed that AMB- 1 MamK polymerizes in the presence of ATP and GTP at different critical concentrations (Ozyamak et al., 2013 b). However, the efficient polymerization of regular Mcas MamK filaments was only triggered through ATP in vitro.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 +-dependent {{activation}} of striated muscle involves cooperative interactions of cross-bridges and thin filament regulatory proteins. We investigated how interactions between individual structural regulatory units (RUs; 1 tropomyosin, 1 troponin, 7 <b>actins)</b> influence {{the level and}} rate of demembranated (skinned) cardiac muscle force development by exchanging native cardiac troponin (cTn) with different ratio mixtures of wild-type (WT) cTn and cTn containing WT cardiac troponin T/I + cardiac troponin C (cTnC) D 65 A (a site II inactive cTnC mutant). Maximal Ca 2 +-activated force (Fmax) increased {{in less than a}} linear manner with WT cTn. This contrasts with results we obtained previously in skeletal fibres (using sTnC D 28 A, D 65 A) where Fmax increased in a greater than linear manner with WT sTnC, and suggests that Ca 2 + binding to each functional Tn activates 7 <b>actins</b> in skeletal muscle. The Ca 2 + sensitivity of force and rate of force redevelopment (ktr) was leftward shifted by 0. 1 – 0. 2 −log [Ca 2 +] (pCa) units as WT cTn content was increased, but the slope of the force–pCa relation and maximal ktr were unaffected by loss of near-neighbour RU interactions. Cross-bridge inhibition (with butanedione monoxime) or augmentation (with 2 deoxy-ATP) had no greater effect in cardiac muscle with disruption of near-neighbour RU interactions, in contrast to skeletal muscle fibres where the effect was enhanced. The rate of Ca 2 + dissociation was found to be > 2 -fold faster from whole cardiac Tn compared with skeletal Tn. Together the data suggest that in cardiac (as opposed to skeletal) muscle, Ca 2 + binding to individual Tn complexes is insufficient to completely activate their corresponding RUs, making thin filament activation level more dependent on concomitant Ca 2 + binding at neighbouring Tn sites and/or crossbridge feedback effects on Ca 2 + binding affinity...|$|R
