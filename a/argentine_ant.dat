5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant,</b> however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecologist William Brown, Jr., {{was perhaps}} {{the first person to}} {{question}} the monophyly of the genus, mentioning that the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant,</b> a former member of Iridomyrmex, differed {{from the rest of the}} genus. The first proper revisions of the genus began in the 1990s, and 91 species were transferred to six genera; only 62 species remained after these revisions. These species were placed into the genera Anonychomyrma, Doleromyrma, Linepithema, Ochetellus, Papyrius and Philidris. In 2011, the genus was revised again, and 79 species and five extinct species were now present, 31 of which were newly described. Four species were placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms. According to one source, 350 Australian Iridomyrmex species may be present.|$|E
5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant,</b> pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E

25|$|As mentioned, red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} and Argentine ants compete with each other. Mortality rates vary in different scenarios (i.e. mortality rates in colony confrontation {{is lower than}} those confronting {{each other in the}} field). Major workers can also withstand more injuries to their bodies, thus increasing the mortality rate of Argentine ants. For an <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> colony to successfully wipe out a monogyne colony of 160,000 workers, the colony would need 396,800 workers. A colony that has reduced in size due to successful bait treatment are prone to predation by Argentine ants. The ants may {{play a vital role in}} removing weakened fire ant colonies, and they may also be important in slowing the spread of these fire ants, especially in heavily infested <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> areas. Despite this, <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> populations in the southeastern United States have declined following the introduction of the red imported fire ant.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{their numbers}} have been declining, and this has often been {{attributed}} to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant.</b> Their decline has affected many native species, especially those for which the red harvester ant is a chief source of food, such as the Texas horned lizard.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{invasive}} species that T. sessile {{has had to}} contend with is the Linepithema humile, or <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant.</b> Studies of its interactions with L. humile has helped researchers better understand the aggression of T. sessile. T. sessile ants do not fight with their nest mates, and it was found that they only fought collectively in six of forty interactions. This often caused T. sessile to lose in interactions with other ants, such as the L. humile, even when they have more individuals. This is because species like the L. humile work together while the T. sessile does not. The T. sessile is however more likely to win in one-on-one interactions because they have effective chemical defenses.|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species have}} been {{recognized}} as one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity and can have dire economic consequences. Yet rates of invasion are increasing due to the fast and growing network of transportation across the globe. The establishment, spread and impact of invasive species are affected by environmental conditions as well as resident species. Species respond differently to the same abiotic factors and different native species can respond either positively or negatively to invasion. The interaction between invasive and resident species, as well as the effect of temperature on invasive species, has gained much attention. The synergistic effect of suboptimal temperature and biotic resistance could have a much stronger limiting or controlling effect on invasive species than either factor alone. Linepithema humile (<b>Argentine</b> <b>ants)</b> are invasive species originally from a Mediterranean climate, but successfully spreading into extra range habitats. The establishment and spread of these ants in temperate New Zealand represents an ideal model system for studying invasion biology in terms of temperature limits and biotic resistance effects. I investigated the changing distribution of the invasive species the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> over multiple years at five sites in New Zealand. To test whether their rate of spread corresponds with microclimate I investigated their fine-scare distribution patterns and evaluated the number of generations they may develop seasonally and annually in different microhabitat types. I also evaluated their impact on other arthropod species. I conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the effect of temperature on their aggression towards other species, walking speed, and foraging abundance. Similarly, I tested the effect of biotic resistance from other ant species (Monomorium antarcticum and Prolasius advenus) with varying colony sizes. I investigated whether there was any interactive effect of temperature and biotic resistance on the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants.</b> The distribution of <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> had declined across many invasion fronts over the past 7 - 8 years. They were more likely to be found in concrete, short grass and sandy habitats, which provide warm microsites. Degree-day calculations predicted that they could develop between 2. 5 to 3 generations in each of the above microhabitats per year in urban and rural sites while they were predicted to be unable to develop one generation under tree habitats. In tall grass microhabitats they were predicted to develop between 1 - 1. 5 generations per year. The <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> were hypothesised to adversely affect many other arthropod species. Richness and abundance of resident beetle species were negatively correlated with the invasion of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants.</b> Areas invaded by the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> were also associated with a greater number of exotic beetle species, which may imply secondary invasion. Laboratory experiments showed that lowering temperatures below 17 °C negatively affected the Argentine ants‟ walking speed, foraging abundance, aggression and their resource control. A high colony size of M. antarcticum (the competing ant species) affected the foraging success of <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants,</b> and the effect was stronger when coupled with unsuitable temperature (17 °C and below). Therefore, <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> are weak competitors at low temperature levels. The results of my thesis underline the importance of biotic and abiotic resistances, their interactive effect as well as the effect of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> on other species. Based on climatic considerations and the habitat preferences of resident species it may be possible to predict future spread of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants.</b> More importantly, knowledge of microhabitat preferences and biotic resistance may help future control measures against <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> based on management of vegetation structure and microhabitat availability...|$|R

25|$|In areas it is native to, the red {{important}} {{fire ant}} {{is still a}} dominant species and coexists with 28 ant species in gallery forest gaps and ten species in xerophytic forest grassland, winning most aggressive interactions with other ants. However, some ants can be co-dominant in areas where they coexist such as the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant,</b> where they compete symmetrically. Workers regularly engage in food competition with other ants, and can suppress the exploitation of food resources from honeydew-producing hemipterans (specifically from Phenacoccus solenopsis) from native ants; however, red important fire ants are unable to eliminate T. melanocephalum completely although they consume {{a higher proportion of}} food. Instead, the two ants may peacefully coexist and share the honeydew. When encountering neighboring fire ants, workers may take on death-feigning behaviours to avoid them with success. However, such behaviour is only seen in young workers, as older workers either flee or fight back when threatened.|$|E

2500|$|Myrmecochory is the {{dispersal}} of seeds by ants. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called elaiosomes (e.g. bloodroot, trilliums, acacias, and {{many species of}} Proteaceae). [...] Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them. [...] The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten. [...] The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants. [...] This dispersal relationship {{is an example of}} mutualism, since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food. [...] As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other. [...] In South Africa, the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> (Linepithema humile) has invaded and displaced native species of ants. [...] Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of Mimetes cucullatus or eat the elaiosomes. [...] In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of Mimetes seedlings have dropped.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{ecological}} effects of invasions often become obvious soon after introduced species become established, more gradual effects may {{take years to}} manifest and can thus require long-term data for quantification. We analyzed an 8 -year record of stable isotope data on <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data (δ 15 N) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between native and introduced populations, and (ii) how relative trophic position as estimated by δ 15 N values of <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> compare {{with those of other}} ants at the same site. Both long-term and biregional comparisons indicate that the <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant's</b> relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of occupation. Over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared. Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of <b>ants,</b> <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera.

40|$|By {{determining}} {{if there}} is any temporal variation in toxic bait, carbohydrate and protein preference in <b>Argentine</b> and Darwin’s <b>ants,</b> we can provide better control options because we can identify with more accuracy when ants will be foraging for one food type over another. Improving our understanding is also fundamental as we can improve future bait formulations, bait application and timing, and increase levels of bait uptake. I have two aims in this thesis. First, I investigated toxic bait, carbohydrate and protein preferences for <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> (Linepithema humile) and Darwin's ant (Doleromyrma darwiniana). The second aim in my thesis was to examine the efficacy of toxic baits in laboratory colonies of <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants.</b> Food preferences varied between species and within species considerably throughout the year, although Darwin's ant consistently favoured foods higher in carbohydrates. <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> showed a significant preference for protein over carbohydrates during December and January. Despite differences in carbohydrate and protein preferences the preference for individual toxic baits showed little temporal variation. The toxic bait efficacy experiment revealed that Xstinguish™ and Exterm-an-Ant® baits produced the highest mortality rate. Other commercially available toxic baits had little effect on workers or queens. The efficacy of the toxic baits was influenced by the starvation level of the ant colonies, and only the colonies that were starved for 48 hours experienced a 100 % mortality rate. Due to these results, I recommend that bait application with Xstinguish™ and Exterm-an-Ant® in late winter-spring would be optimal as this time frame is when ants are likely to be starved, and when foraging activity is increasing, thus maximising the chances of bait uptake. A second round of baiting treatment with both baits (Xstinguish™ and Exterm-an-Ant®) in summer when <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> have been shown to undergo a second wave of reproduction could also be beneficial...|$|R

50|$|Like {{workers in}} many other ant species, <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> workers are unable to lay {{reproductive}} eggs but can direct the development of eggs into reproductive females; the production of males appears {{to be controlled by}} the amount of food available to the larvae. <b>Argentine</b> <b>ant</b> colonies almost invariably have many reproductive queens, as many as eight for every 1,000 workers.

25|$|Similarly, {{individuals}} can inhibit parasite uptake by refraining from consuming infected conspecifics. <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> (Linepithema humile) and cornfield ants (Lasius alienus) both detect chemical 'ant deterrent factors' adaptively produced by entamopathogenic bacteria and thus avoid infected corpses; R. tibalis doesn't cannibalize conspecifics infected with M. anisopliae.|$|R
40|$|Social insects {{maintain}} colony cohesion {{by recognizing}} and, if necessary, discriminating against conspecifics {{that are not}} part of the colony. This recognition ability is encoded by a complex mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), although it is largely unclear how social insects interpret such a multifaceted signal. CHC profiles often contain several series of homologous hydrocarbons, possessing the same methyl branch position but differing in chain length (e. g., 15 -methyl-pentatriacontane, 15 -methyl-heptatriacontane, 15 -methyl-nonatriacontane). Recent studies have revealed that within species these homologs can occur in correlated concentrations. In such cases, single compounds may convey the same information as the homologs. In this study, we used behavioral bioassays to explore how social insects perceive and interpret different hydrocarbons. We tested the aggressive response of <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants,</b> Linepithema humile, toward nest-mate CHC profiles that were augmented with one of eight synthetic hydrocarbons that differed in branch position, chain length, or both. We found that <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> showed similar levels of aggression toward nest-mate CHC profiles augmented with compounds that had the same branch position but differed in chain length. Conversely, <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> displayed different levels of aggression toward nest-mate CHC profiles augmented with compounds that had different branch positions but the same chain length. While this was true in almost all cases, one CHC we tested elicited a greater aggressive response than its homologs. Interestingly, this was the only compound that did not occur naturally in correlated concentrations with its homologs in CHC profiles. Combined, these data suggest that CHCs of a homologous series elicit the same aggressive response because they convey the same information, rather than <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> being unable to discriminate between different homologs. This study contributes to our understanding of the chemical basis of nestmate recognition by showing that, similar to spoken language, the chemical language of social insects contains “synonyms,” chemicals that differ in structure, but not meaning...|$|R
40|$|<b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> (Linepithema humile) live {{in groups}} of nests {{connected}} by trails {{to each other and}} to stable food sources. In a field study, we investigated whether some ants recruit directly from established, persistent trails to food sources, thus accelerating food collection. Our results indicate that <b>Argentine</b> <b>ants</b> recruit nestmates to food directly from persistent trails, and that the exponential increase in the arrival rate of ants at baits is faster than would be possible if recruited ants traveled from distant nests. Once ants find a new food source, they walk back and forth between the bait and sometimes share food by trophallaxis with nestmates on the trail. Recruiting ants from nearby persistent trails creates a dynamic circuit, like those found in other distributed systems, which facilitates a quick response to changes in available resources...|$|R
