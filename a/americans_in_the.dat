5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature.

5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native <b>Americans.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E

5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Mississippi River region.

On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E
