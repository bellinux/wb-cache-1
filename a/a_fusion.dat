50|$|The unikonts have <b>a</b> triple-gene <b>fusion</b> that {{is lacking}} in the bikonts. The three genes that are fused {{together}} in the unikonts, but not bacteria or bikonts, encode enzymes for synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides: carbamoyl phosphate synthase, dihydroorotase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase. This must have involved <b>a</b> double <b>fusion,</b> <b>a</b> rare pair of events, supporting the shared ancestry of Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa.|$|R
50|$|Dr. David Hafemeister of California Polytechnic State University {{described}} the radioactive effects of <b>a</b> pure <b>fusion</b> weapon {{to be much}} {{higher than that of}} a fission-triggered device. He also described <b>a</b> pure <b>fusion</b> weapon as having twice the radioactive output than current fusion-based weapons. The destruction, however, is lessened given the fact that <b>a</b> pure <b>fusion</b> weapon contributes <b>a</b> smaller blast energy than that of fission-based weapons, which are recorded as having a greater kinetic energy than fusion devices.|$|R

5|$|Lithium deuteride was {{the fusion}} fuel {{of choice in}} early {{versions}} of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, {{was responsible for the}} runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> material.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium foil {{is used in}} {{cladding}} titanium {{to steel}} because it is compatible with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> reactor.|$|E

Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Brown Sugar is {{the debut}} album of American R singer and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo. It was {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by EMI Music. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1994 to 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City and at the Pookie Lab in Sacramento. Production, instrumentation, arrangements, and songwriting were primarily handled by D'Angelo, who employed both vintage recording equipment and modern electronic devices. Brown Sugar contains themes of love and romance, and features <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of contemporary R and traditional soul music, along with elements of funk, quiet storm, and hip hop music.|$|E

Next we introduce a new notion of <b>a</b> Riesz <b>fusion</b> bases in <b>a</b> Hilbert space. We show that any Riesz fusion basis is equivalent with <b>a</b> orthonormal <b>fusion</b> basis. We also obtain generalizations of Theorem 4. 6 of [1]. Our results generalize results obtained for Riesz bases in Hilbert spaces. Finally we obtain some results about stability of fusion frame sequences under small perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Biometric {{performance}} {{improvement is}} a challenging task. In this paper, <b>a</b> hierarchical strategy <b>fusion</b> based on multimodal biometric system is presented. This strategy {{relies on a}} combination of several biometric traits using <b>a</b> multi-level biometric <b>fusion</b> hierarchy. The multi-level biometric <b>fusion</b> includes <b>a</b> pre-classification <b>fusion</b> with optimal feature selection and <b>a</b> post-classification <b>fusion</b> that is based on the similarity of the maximum of matching scores. The proposed solution enhances biometric recognition performances based on suitable feature selection and reduction, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), as much as not all of the feature vectors components support the performance improvement degree...|$|R
5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E

Eventually, Brătianu convened with Ferdinand {{his return to}} power, and the king called on Foreign Minister Take Ionescu to resign, thus causing a political crisis that profited the PNL {{and put an end}} to the Averescu cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Folk metal is <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> {{genre of}} heavy metal music and {{traditional}} folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by {{the widespread use}} of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.|$|E

5|$|Ilaiyaraaja's {{first two}} non-film albums were explorations in {{the fusion of}} Indian and Western {{classical}} music. The first, How to Name It? (1986), {{is dedicated to the}} Carnatic master Tyāgarāja and to J. S. Bach. It features <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas, fugues and Baroque musical textures. The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— that music is a natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E
5|$|KMFDM's {{music has}} since been <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of {{electronic}} and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, {{so there is a}} degree of versatility and freedom in the music.|$|E
5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} use of antimatter as <b>an</b> alternative <b>fusion</b> trigger, mainly {{in the context of}} antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion but also nuclear weapons. Such a system, in a weapons context, would have many of the desired properties of <b>a</b> pure <b>fusion</b> weapon. However, the technical barriers to producing and containing the required quantities of antimatter appear formidable, well beyond present capabilities. Induced gamma emission is another approach that is currently being researched. Very high energy-density chemicals such as ballotechnics and others have also been suggested as a means of triggering <b>a</b> pure <b>fusion</b> weapon.|$|R
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland {{the last quarter of}} the 16th century and the first quarter of the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As <b>a</b> <b>fusion</b> of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque.|$|E
