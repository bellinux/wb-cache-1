Secondly, the reality <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in mediation is explored, leading to a conclusion that confidentiality is insufficiently assured in the mediation environment to warrant its use in a marketing context (at least without significant explanation and qualification). Thirdly, two key reasons why ethical considerations may be compromised in terms of marketing mediation using confidentiality are considered.

40|$|The thesis "Limitations of {{professional}} liability {{in relation to}} the professions of auditor, tax adviser and accountant with regard to the duty of confidentiality" focuses on a more detailed elaboration of the selected specific segment {{of professional}} liability of the given professions, on the legal and ethical obligations in the field <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and the possibility of its breaking. The introductory part of the thesis deals with <b>confidentiality</b> in terms <b>of</b> historical development and its importance in the present. Further, it outlines the area of moral and ethical responsibility, legal liability in general, and confidentiality as a specific duty. The concept <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the professions of auditors, tax advisers and accountants represents the core of the presented work. The duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the profession of auditors is significantly influenced by the public interest in the presented information in the form of opinion on the financial statements of the audited entities, and thus the possibilities of the legally supported breaking of this obligation are the most extensive, as evidenced by the amendment to the Act on Auditors, effective from 1 October 2016. The duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the tax adviser has until recently been strictly defined on a legal basis. The change was brought by the Supreme Court's case law in November 2015, which by comparing the principally equivalent conditions for the exercise of legal liability in the area <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the tax adviser and attorney, also deduces the similarities of competencies of both professions in cases <b>of</b> breaking the <b>confidentiality.</b> The accounting profession is not regulated by law, and therefore the confidentiality obligation is also not legally enforceable. However, professional certified accountants are required to comply with the Code of Conduct issued by the Professional Chamber. The final part of the thesis focuses on comparing the duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the selected professions of auditors, tax advisers and professional accountants with the attorney-at-law profession...|$|R

40|$|The utility <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and {{inadmissibility}} <b>of</b> that communicated orally or {{in writing}} during Family Dispute Resolution (‘FDR’) {{has recently been}} questioned. A tension exists between the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> dispute resolution processes and the desire of Courts, especially with increasing focus upon addressing abuse and family violence, to have all available evidence accessible. This article introduces and analyses data obtained from an extensive 2014 / 15 survey of practicing Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners (‘FDRPs’) from private, government and community based practice regarding their attitudes to confidentiality and its importance in Family Dispute Resolution. Discourse regarding the utility <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> has pointed to the asserted absence of empirical research into the attitudes of FDRPs regarding the importance <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> This survey was undertaken {{to contribute to the}} discourse regarding confidentiality in FDR and so as to ensure that the views of FDRPs were ascertained and heard in such discourses.

40|$|The {{contractual}} {{nature of}} arbitration {{as a form}} of alternative dispute resolution in the context of cross-border/international disputes traditionally emphasises <b>confidentiality</b> as one <b>of</b> the fundamental characteristics <b>of</b> international arbitration. <b>Confidentiality</b> is often assumed to be a common feature and advantage of international commercial arbitration, and the privacy of arbitral proceedings has facilitated and encouraged recourse to arbitration. However, the issue <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> has a different dimension and is limited in the context of international investment and trade disputes. The participation of States, State entities, sub-divisions and agencies in international disputes shifts the emphasis from privacy and confidentiality to transparency and accountability. This study analyses the role <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in investor-State arbitration, noting that confidentiality is not always preserved in many respects and stages throughout the arbitration proceedings. The paper considers the issues that challenge the legal effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in international investor-State arbitration and the development towards transparency. In particular, the paper examines the participation of non-disputing/third parties in investor-State arbitration, the different approaches of major arbitral institutions towards the issue <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> and the arguments for and against confidentiality in relation to transparency. It concludes by making recommendations {{in the context of the}} development of investor-State arbitration...|$|R
