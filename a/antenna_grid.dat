40|$|Differential {{evolution}} (DE) {{has been}} traditionally applied to solving benchmark continuous optimisation functions. To {{enable it to}} solve a combinatorially oriented design problem, such as the construction of effective radio frequency identification antennas, requires {{the development of a}} suitable encoding of the discrete decision variables in a continuous space. This study introduces an encoding that allows the algorithm to construct antennas of varying complexity and length. The DE algorithm developed is a multiobjective approach that maximises antenna efficiency and minimises resonant frequency. Its results are compared with those generated by a family of ant colony optimisation (ACO) metaheuristics that have formed the standard in this area. Results indicate that DE can work well on this problem and that the proposed solution encoding is suitable. On small <b>antenna</b> <b>grid</b> sizes (hence, smaller solution spaces) DE performs well in comparison to ACO, while as the solution space increases its relative performance decreases. However, as the ACO employs a local search operator that the DE currently does not, there is scope for further improvement to the DE approach. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{would add}} {{computational}} {{power to a}} plethora of ordinary objects. Potential applications are vast and vary in terms of maturity from sensors tracking energy usage to smart wearables and many more futuristic applications. A challenge shared by many of such small devices, {{in the order of}} a few centimeters in length and width, is battery and power. Cost, size, weight, and lifetime of the battery motivate alternative methods for providing energy to such devices. A practical Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system which can power battery-less and charge coil-free smart everyday-objects has a tremendous potential to address this demand. In this work we offer a reliable solution. The 60 -GHz WPT system that is built in this project can be employed by any smart device which can be placed at a reasonably close distance to its power transmitter, without the alignment and proximity challenges which are associated with the magnetic charging solutions. The leading applications to benefit enormously from this new 60 -GHz WPT technology are miniature IoT devices, smart charge cards, business cards and IDs, smart posters, sensor fusion, and wireless flash memories. In this work, the first reported full-system 60 -GHz WPT solution which can power battery-less and charge coil-free compact smart devices is presented. The system is fabricated in a 40 -nm digital CMOS process and an inexpensive 500 -µm CCL-HL 832 MG antenna packaging material. The rectenna (RX) of this 60 -GHz WPT system consists of a <b>grid</b> <b>antenna</b> with a measured gain of 10. 7 dBi, integrated with a tuned complementary cross-coupled oscillator-like rectifier. It harvests DC power at a rate of 1 mW with a 28. 2 % RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE). This PCE rate is significantly higher than the prior art and reaches 32. 8 % for 1. 4 mA output current. A novel theoretical analysis of the unique rectifier circuitry is presented which helps formulating all key specifications and identifying the design trade-offs. We present a cascode version of the energy harvester that produces higher DC output voltage and higher PCE in low current regime. The theoretical analysis and the results of the measurement for that harvester is also presented. The transmitter (TX) is equipped with a quad-core power amplifier which produces a total saturated output power (Psat) of 24. 6 dBm, which is the highest reported power delivery in digital CMOS technology at mm-wave bands. The TX peak PAE is 9. 4 %. The quad-core PA performs a 4 × 8 -way differential power combining and implements a binary-tree architecture by using power-splitting transformers which perform intra-stage matching too. The designed 2 × 2 <b>grid</b> array <b>antenna</b> helps the TX produce a peak EIRP level of 35. 3 dBm. The coupling between the TX and RX antennas within 4 cm spacing is between - 18. 9 and - 17. 4 dB. The results of full-system characterizations of the WPT solution and the measurements data of the individually-fabricated <b>grid</b> <b>antennas,</b> harvester, transmitter, and all building blocks are reported. Programmability in the input polarities of the quad-core PA offers output power control and beam-steering capabilities to this 60 -GHz WPT system. A four-input <b>grid</b> <b>antenna</b> is designed for the TX which in simulation shows an effective 70 ° beam-steering range in the broadside direction. In order to demonstrate how the design and implementation of all the 60 -GHz circuitry has been as successful as they are, the design of the VCOs, quadrature VCOs, PAs, unit-cell devices, pads and calibration circuitry, passive components like inductors, transformers, capacitors, the patch <b>antennas,</b> and the <b>grid</b> array <b>antennas</b> that have been done before the final implementation of the full wireless power transfer system are presented as well and the key design points are specified and explained.

We show that all correlations for such a 2 D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a Fast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2 n dimensions. This can allow major correlator cost reductions for science applications requiring exquisite sensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21 cm tomography (where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long baselines are needed for point source removal), helping enable future 21 cm experiments with thousands or millions of cheap dipole-like <b>antennas.</b> Such hierarchical <b>grids</b> combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional array layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform Telescope.

The first of these, {{which is based}} on fractal concepts, is a Sierpinski gasket type of fractal configuration, printed on a dielectric substrate backed by a ground plane. We propose a novel approach to enhancing its multiband performance, in terms of impedance matching characteristics as well as radiation patterns, at three operating frequencies.

40|$|Summary The {{objectives}} {{of our study}} were to assess the feasibility of using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to study roots over {{a broad range of}} soil conditions in the southeastern United States. Study sites were located in the Southern Piedmont, Carolina Sandhills and Atlantic Coast Flatwoods. At each site, we tested for selection of the appropriate antenna (400 MHz versus 1. 5 GHz), determined the ability of GPR to resolve roots and buried organic debris, assessed root size, estimated root biomass, and gauged the practicality of using GPR. Resolution of roots was best in sandy, excessively drained soils, whereas soils with high soil water and clay contents seriously degraded resolution and observation depth. In the Carolina Sandhills, 16 1 × 1 -m plots were scanned with the 1. 5 GHz <b>antenna</b> using overlapping <b>grids.</b> Plots were subsequently excavated, larger roots (> 0. 5 cm diameter) sketched on graph paper before removal, and all roots oven-dried, classified by size and weighed. Roots as small as 0. 5 cm in diameter were detected with GPR. We were able to size roots (0. 5 to 6. 5 cm in diameter) that were oriented perpendicular to the radar sweep (r 2 = 0. 81, P = 0. 0004). Use of image analysis software to relate the magnitude of radar parabolas to actual root biomass resulted in significant correlations (r 2 = 0. 55, P = 0. 0274). Orientation and geometry of the reflective surface seemed to have a greater influence on parabola dimensions than did root size. We conclude that the utility of current GPR technology for estimating root biomass is site-specific, and that GPR is ineffective in soils with high clay or water content and at sites with rough terrain (most forests). Under particular soil and site conditions, GPR appears to be useful for augmenting traditional biomass sampling...|$|R

40|$|A {{new trend}} {{to develop the}} new assets of the modern High Voltage (HV) grid has been {{deployed}} {{on one of the}} major current investment projects of the Belgian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Elia. The new approach is a technique which is mapping the known, foreseeable and even unknown risks of a project. Starting from the impact of these risks on the installation, commissioning, operation, maintenance, emergency interventions, even decommissioning, the protection systems, lightning protection, electrical phenomena, each different topic will be treated to mitigate the corresponding risks within acceptable levels. One of the very first projects where this new approach is applied, is the STEVIN link. This link, named after Renaissance mathematician Simon Stevin from Bruges, is a necessary step to connect electrical power from almost all wind power plants in the Belgian Territorial waters and from the NEMO HVDC link (connection the Belgian and the English grid with a rating of 1000 MW) to the main 400 kV grid, which is situated some 50 km inland. Close to the coastal area, only a radial 150 kV grid actually exists, which is unable to absorb all the new announced offshore electrical power. The success of the wind integration program and the interconnector with the UK depends on the availability of this new <b>grid</b> <b>antenna.</b> The rating chosen for this new link is 3000 MVA, valid for any single contingency situation within this connection. This value corresponds to the highest transferred power stated by forecasting studies for wind energy production projected over 20 years in the future. The permitting procedure, with the visual impact and the generation of electro-magnetical fields of the link in particular, made the option to have the link using only overhead line technology impossible. Several options to have the link partly underground were researched, and the choice finally fell on the use of four parallel three-phase systems of 400 kV underground cable on the section closest to the historical of Bruges. As a consequence, reactive power compensation, by means of shunt reactors had to be integrated into the project. The paper presents for each part of the final structure of the mixed-structured Stevin Link the technical choices, related identified risks and their mitigation methods: for the overhead line parts, the underground cable sections, the technical choices and motivations for the link end and intermediate substations, ratings, functions and technical characteristics of the reactive power compensation devices. status: publishe...|$|R
