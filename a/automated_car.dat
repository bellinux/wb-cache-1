2500|$|In 2011, over 11.8million people {{visited the}} seven oases. These {{facilities}} in Illinois have gas stations (Mobil) with 24-hour <b>automated</b> <b>car</b> washes, fast food restaurants (McDonald's, Panda Express, Subway, etc.), and other various shops (such as Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Coleman Distributors, and TravelMart). Oases also have automatic teller machines. [...] Six of the oases are {{built as a}} bridge-restaurant, directly over the Interstate Highway they service. [...] The oasis in DeKalb is the only exception, with the facility located along the southern (eastbound) side of Interstate 88, and a vehicle overpass allows westbound traffic to access a segregated parking lot and gas station along {{one side of the}} facility. [...] All the oases provide free WiFi access for visitors. [...] The oases have a drive-thru lane for the McDonald's. All oases, except for the Hinsdale and DeKalb oases, have Tollway Customer Service Centers, where I-Pass toll transponders are sold and serviced. The oases have a total of [...] of retail space. As of 2009, the oases were 45 percent to 65 percent vacant. ISTHA has established a special task force to study of the oases' future.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of car parking systems: {{traditional}} and automated. In the long term, <b>automated</b> <b>car</b> parking systems {{are likely to be more}} cost effective when compared to traditional parking garages. Automatic multi-storey <b>automated</b> <b>car</b> park systems are less expensive per parking slot, since they tend to require less building volume and less ground area than a conventional facility with the same capacity. Both <b>automated</b> <b>car</b> parking systems and automated parking garage systems reduce pollution — cars are not running or circling around while drivers look for parking spaces.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{study on}} public {{opinions}} towards implementation of automated vehicles in urban areas is reported {{which is based on}} a survey in La Rochelle. This {{was a part of the}} evaluation activities on the automated vehicle demonstrated in the city. According to the surveys, public attitudes were positive towards implementation of automated buses in urban areas. The most attractive benefit of automated buses would be lower bus fares because of no driver costs. About two thirds of people surveyed would consider taking automated buses if both automated and conventional buses were available on a route. Passenger security would be one of most concerned issues for automated buses especially during night time services. The public attitudes towards <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> in urban areas were also positive. More than half of the people surveyed stated that they would consider using <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> if they become available, with three quarters being interested in owning an <b>automated</b> <b>cars,</b> and one quarter in sharing <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> through services such as car-sharing, car-pooling, or taxis...|$|R

30|$|Public {{opinion and}} {{consumer}} preferences {{are among the}} various constraints on the rollout of <b>automated</b> <b>cars,</b> as they will affect the decision-making of both automotive industry actors and public-sector regulators. This study contributes to the growing body of the literature regarding this issue, through a moderate-scale survey (n =  370) that incorporated both prioritization/attitudinal questions (regarding public opinion) and a stated-preference module (to identify consumer preferences). The survey protocol includes a stated-preference approach to investigate consumers’ preferences {{for the possibility of}} very high rates of speed in <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> on long-distance journeys. We found separately identifiable effects for average travel speeds (manifested as journey duration) and maximum travel speed in the stated-preference scenarios. In the ‘prioritization’ component of the survey, respondents ranked having the ‘highest possible level of safety’ as the single most important benefit that they would like <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> to deliver, ahead of benefits such as being able to performing activities while traveling or having traffic congestion reduced. This result has consequences for the car-following distances that are programmed into the control algorithms of <b>automated</b> <b>cars.</b> Documenting this finding is important, as decisions must be made in the near future by driving-algorithm designers, public-sector regulators, and ultimately the judiciary regarding the guidelines for acceptable automated driving-behavior instructions.|$|R

30|$|A {{counterintuitive}} {{result from}} the mode choice analysis is that the parameter for travel time for the ‘Semi-driverless car’ option is smaller than for the ‘Completely driverless car.’ This is contrary to a priori expectations, {{as it has been}} theorized by researchers [13, 14] that travelers in fully <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> may have lower values (disutilities) of travel time, as being disengaged from the driving task would allow the vehicle occupant to focus on other productive or leisurely activities.

Much research is developed in engineering, about legal and behavioral issues, but the economics of autonomous vehicle remains an open area. In this paper, we consider a single-bottleneck situation, in which {{the capacity of the}} freeway is divided between conventional and autonomous vehicles. Users of conventional vehicles freely choose their departure time from home, while users of autonomous vehicles collaborate with a central operator that ensures they do not queue. An individual-specific cooperation cost is integrated in the modeling framework. We address the following key issues: how should infrastructure be allocated to conventional and <b>automated</b> <b>cars?</b> Are there synergies between the two fleets of vehicle? How should each infrastructure be tolled? Should the government be a toll leader? Which regulations are needed...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{results from a}} moderate-sample survey of the public’s {{priorities}} for <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> and preferences for their specific attributes {{in the context of}} a stated-preference survey. The context of the stated-preference survey is long-distance travel (specifically to visit relatives), and a novel result is that travelers appear to value both their ‘effective’ or average speed and their maximum speed (i.e., their ‘cruising speed’ under free-flow conditions). Results regarding the public’s priorities demonstrate that safety appears to clearly be a higher priority than congestion reduction, a finding which has consequences for the car-following distances that are programmed into the control algorithms of <b>automated</b> <b>cars.</b> Documenting this finding is important, as decisions must be made in the near future by driving-algorithm designers, public-sector regulators, and ultimately the judiciary regarding the guidelines for acceptable automated driving-behavior instructions.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify novel aspects of consumer preferences and public opinion regarding highly <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> (levels 2 through 4 under the NHTSA taxonomy [7]). For instance, we investigate consumers’ relative prioritization of various prospective benefits of <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> and their preferences for travel at higher rates of free-flow speed than at present; neither of these issues are addressed in the prior literature. To do this, we designed a survey protocol that included both attitudinal questions and a stated-preference component. The survey was administered to a moderate-sized sample (n =  370), which was generated according to a sampling plan based on age/gender quotas (the sampling strategy is described in detail in Sect.  3). Therefore, the results can be interpreted as being nationally representative along these dimensions; however, larger sample (n >>  1000) follow-on surveying will be required to have greater confidence in the findings.|$|R

50|$|Service {{intervals}} vary for <b>automated</b> <b>car</b> parking systems, {{depending on}} the type of machines used and their usage.

In addition, regular cleaning is mandatory to keep the car parking system in great working order, especially with the problems posed by weather (salt on the road can spread to lifter platforms and cause severe damage if not removed. A reputable car parking company will regularly clean all critical elements of its automated parking system, including the car lifters top and bottom, all concrete pits, all posts resting on the concrete, and the entire concrete floor in the parking area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>car</b> parking systems use {{a similar}} type of {{technology}} to that used for mechanical parcel handling and document retrieval. The driver leaves the car inside an entrance area and technology parks the vehicle at a designated area. Hydraulic or mechanical car lifters raise the vehicle to another level for proper storing. The vehicle can be transported vertically (up or down) and horizontally (left and right) to a vacant parking space until the car is needed again. When the vehicle is needed, the process is reversed and the car lifts transport the vehicle {{back to the same}} area where the driver left it. In some cases, a turntable may be used to position the car so that the driver can conveniently drive away without the need to back up.|$|E

40|$|Highly <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> have {{undergone}} tremendous investment and progress {{over the past}} ten years with speculation about fully-driverless cars within the foreseeable, or even near future, becoming common. If a driverless future is realized, what might be the impact on personal aviation? Would self-piloting airplanes be a relatively simple spin-off, possibly making travel by personal aircraft also commonplace? What if the technology for completely removing human drivers turns out to be further in the future rather than sooner; would such a delay suggest that transformational personal aviation is also somewhere over the horizon or can transformation be achieved with less than full automation? This paper presents a preliminary exploration of these questions by comparing the operational, functional, and implementation requirements and constraints of cars and small aircraft for on-demand mobility. In general, we predict that the mission management and perception requirements of self-piloting aircraft differ significantly from self-driving cars and requires the development of aviation specific technologies. We also predict that the highly-reliable control and system automation technology developed for conditionally and highly <b>automated</b> <b>cars</b> can have a significant beneficial effect on personal aviation, even if full automation is not immediately feasible...|$|R
