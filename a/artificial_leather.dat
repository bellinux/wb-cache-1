It {{is based on the}} powder sintering in a mould. The mould is loaded thermally during the production cycle and mechanically when manipulated. As cracks had occurred in the mould it was necessary to verify whether the cause of the crack initiation was thermal or mechanical loading. The aim of the first stage of the verification was the theoretical computation and measurement of the real mould loading during the manipulation. The paper describes the methods of computation and measurement...|$|R

30|$|Carboxyl {{groups were}} {{introduced}} into the water-based PU (wPU), and various NaCl (0.025 – 0.25  M) and dyes (10  µm) were added into the resultant ionic wPU (iwPU) dispersion under vigorous stirring for 0.5  h. The as-mixed dispersion was dried at room temperature to form miwPU films. Then, CNT sheets were electrodeposited with PPy up to 1.2  mg at 0.8  V versus Ag/AgCl up to 5  min at 0  °C, in an electrolyte solution (30  mL) containing 0.1  M p-toluenesulfonic acid, 0.3  M sodium toluenesulfonate, and 15  µL pyrrole monomer. Besides serving as the suppliers of p-toluenesulfonate, they can stabilize the pH of the solution, which is {{a key factor in}} the PPy electropolymerization. Pyrrole monomers were purified by distilling before electrodeposition. Two PPy@CNT sheets were {{on each side of the}} miwPU polyelectrolyte film. Finally, two miwPU <b>artificial</b> <b>leathers</b> were deposited on these two sheets.|$|R
40|$|Since 1957, {{when the}} first cases of the {{so-called}} shoe-makers' toxic polyneuropathy were reported, nearly 400 cases have been described in the Italian literature. The substance that {{was considered to be}} responsible for the disease was triorthocresylphosphate (TOCP) contained in glues, <b>artificial</b> <b>leathers,</b> and some types of paints. However numerous chemical analyses of glues and leathers taken from factories where cases of the disease occurred have shown that in almost all instances little or no TOCP was present. In addition the disease manifests itself more frequently during winter and spring and this is not consistent with the absorption of the causative agent through the skin and/or gastrointestinal tract. In order to clarify the aetiology of the disease 122 workers in the shoe industry affected by toxic polymeuropathy during the period 1971 - 74 were studied. Workplaces where cases of polyneuropathy had occurred were visited and samples of glues and solvents were taken for chemical analysis. The polyneuropathy chiefly affects workers engaged in glueing and in the cleaning process, but it also affects those who do not have direct contact with glues or solvents. The disease is more common in women (68 %) than in men (32 %) and, in its more severe form begins with overwhelming prevalence during winter and early spring regardless of the job performed. No direct relationship has been found between the severity of the disease and the number of years of work in the shoe industry or of specific exposure (that is the number of years of work in the activity performed {{at the onset of the}} disease). The polyneuropathy is found almost exclusively among workers of the artisam type in small shoe factories, where standards of hygiene are low. Chemical analysis of glues and cleaning fluids collected from five different factories, where 20 cases of polyneuropathy occurred, showed the presence of paraffin hydrocarbons with a low boiling point (pentane, 2 -methyl-pentane, 3 -methyl-pentane, n-hexane, etc.) in concentrations of more than 80 % by weight...|$|R

The Main Deck contained interior passenger seating (including large semi-circular booths upholstered in <b>artificial</b> red <b>leather)</b> and the snack bar. It also included open-air seating ares forward and aft of the vessel's superstructure. The Upper Deck, reached by an interior stairwell behind the pilothouse or by exterior stairs from the open, forward part of the Main Deck, consisted entirely of open-air seating.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of cellular polyurethanes either as microporous foams in shoe upper materials (poromerics) or in closed cell form as soling materials has increased rapidly {{during the last few}} years in the footwear industry. Compared with vulcanised rubbers, these materials have high strength over an extended temperature range, high set and good resistance to cut growth. The research now presented. has been concerned with determining the reasons for these mechanical properties of polyurethane as compared with compounded conventional vulcanised rubbers. The supplementary contribution to the thesis presents a review of earlier work on the strength and reinforcement of crystalline, amorphous and filled vulcanised rubbers and includes a short section on the effect of crosslinking on ultimate failure properties of natural rubber. This study has been extended by the author into the effect of chain branching in polyurethane elastomers on the failure properties. The viscoelastic properties of natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>leathers</b> are also discussed in order to demonstrate similarities between the different materials and show how a cellular polyurethane sheet has hysteresial properties similar to those of a natural material of fibrous structure. It is shown that a cubical lattice model can be applied to explain the differences between such mechanical properties as modulus, tensile and tear strength of a cellular polyurethane and the corresponding solid material of the same polymer. This model, which has previously been applied to the mechanical properties of a natural rubber latex foam, indicates that the strength of cellular polyurethanes is due to the very high strength of the solid material. An extensive investigation into the effect of time and temperature on the tensile properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes is presented in order to show that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics have a very broad relaxation spectrum extending over 18 decades of time. Because of this response to deformation, the failure properties remain fairly constant over the temperature range from 21 – 160 °c. Above 160 °c, the tensile properties fall quite markedly. Stress softening in these polyurethanes is very high and can only be reversed by heating to temperatures above 160 °c. The cut growth and fatigue properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes are considered. Following a brief review of the investigation on cut growth and fatigue of vulcanised rubbers involving the use of tearing energy theory, it is shown that cut growth and hysteresis properties of vulcanised. rubbers can be correlated. The lower limit of tearing energy (To) below which no cut growth takes place in the absence of chemical effects is found to be higher for polyurethanes than for vulcanised rubbers. Fatigue failure of cellular polyurethanes is found to be due to cut growth from the largest pore in the sample. These data are also compared with measurements on other two phase elastomer systems such as styrene butadiene copolymer vulcanisates with high styrene content and polystyrene-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubbers. From an extensive review of the literature on the structure of polyurethane elastomers, it is deduced that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics consist of a segmented structure of long polyester chains connected to very minute (25 Å) hard urethane segments. The cohesion of the hard segments is primarily due to hydrogen bonding and other physical forces. It is concluded that the high strength, good cut growth resistance and broad relaxation spectrum of polyurethanes are due to the reinforcement given by the hard urethane segments which act as well dispersed minute filler particles in the polyester rubber matrix. The hydrogen bonding between the hard segments dissociates at approximately 170 °c so giving a degree of thermoplasticity which produces a very high permanent set. An appendix discusses some of the practical applications in the footwear industry of the work presented, such as forming of poromerics, tearing from stitch-holes and flex cracking of soling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Polyurethane (PU) {{has been}} widely used in the adhesives, coatings, inks, textile {{finishings}} and <b>artificial</b> <b>leathers,</b> due to the properties of high quality and high variability of chemical structures. In this work, the anionic waterborne polyurethane (WPU) would be synthesized by the prepolymer mixing process. A series of WPUs were obtained by varying the amount {{of different kinds of}} hydrophilic groups, consisting of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), polyols including Aru 5620, a long chain polyester polyol, and D 3117, a long side chain polyether polyol with a sodium sulfonated group, dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), and chain extender including EDA, a short —chain diamine or EES- 200 L, a short-chain diamine with a sodium sulfonated group. With the help of instruments, for instance, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and surface resistivity/resistance meter, the mechanical and thermal properties, and surface resistance were investigated. The factors affecting the properties of the WPUs, such as the amount of hydrophilic groups、chain extender、the content of sulfonated groups and NaClO 4 are taken into account. It is found that the mechanical, thermal, and antistatic properties are significantly affected by the above-mentioned four factors in the WPUs. Moreover, the EES- 200 L-containing system is better than the EDA-containing system in terms of mechanical and thermal properties. This is because the presence of higher hard-segment content in the EES- 200 L-containing system. Furthermore, the higher content of sulfonated groups in the EES- 200 L-containing system also leads to higher physical crosslinking density. The surface resistivity of the EDA-containing system with a higher content of D 3117 is about 109 Ω/■. This would certainly meet the application requirement of the anti-electrostatic materials (109 〜 1012 Ω/■). The EDA-containing system with excellent antistatic properties is potentially useful in the package material of semiconductor. 摘 要 聚氨基甲酸酯(Polyurethane，PU) 具有優良的物性與高度化學結構可變異性，所以已廣泛應用於接著劑、塗料、油墨、纖維處理劑與人造纖維等。在本研究中主要是以預聚物法製備一系列水性聚氨基甲酸酯(WPU) 並探討高分子量親水基、不同分子結構的鏈延長劑包括短鏈雙胺結構的EDA及短鏈雙胺含磺酸鹽官能基的EES- 200 L，與加入不等量的過氯酸鈉(NaClO 4) ，對其熱性質、機械性質與抗靜電性的影響。 本研究中使用霍式轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) 、熱重損失分析儀(TGA) 、熱差掃瞄卡計(DSC) 探討其熱劣解溫度與PU中的結構與結晶情形，同時也利用動態機械分析儀(DMA) 、電阻計、交流阻抗分析儀等測量與探討PU薄膜的機械性質、導電性與PU乳液的粒徑與黏度的關係。在水性聚氨基甲酸酯中改變某些組成成分如:親水基含量、鏈延長劑、磺酸根離子的含量、與過氯酸鈉的含量皆可得到不同機械性質、熱性質與抗靜電性質的水性聚氨基甲酸酯。最後，根據實驗結果，機械性質與熱性質方面，因EES- 200 L系列的硬鏈段含量增加與磺酸根離子增多而產生物理交聯的緣故，使得所呈現出的性質均比EDA系列佳。在表面電阻與體積電阻方面，EDA系列中所含D 3117 比例高之PU薄膜可得較低的表面電阻約為 109 Ω/■，此表面電阻值已符合抗靜電標準(109 〜 1012 Ω/■) ，使得具抗靜電性質的EDA系列可能應用於半導體的包裝材料上。目錄 中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] .
