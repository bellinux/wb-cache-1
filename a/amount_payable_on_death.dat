In 1776 the Society carried out the first actuarial valuation of liabilities and subsequently distributed the first reversionary bonus (1781) and interim bonus (1809) among its members. It also used regular valuations to balance competing interests. Its products therefore met the description of a modern With-profits policy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> did not venture {{heavily in}} the way of promotional singles. [...] "Will You" [...] served as its lead single which had an {{accompanying}} music video.

[...] "Change the World" [...] would be the follow up, but didn't manage to repeat the same level of success.|$|R

[...] Indeed, the album's lyrics maintain P.O.D.'s common themes of spiritual preservation; however, <b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> deemphasizes the upbeat urban rocks anthems of their past.

The band filmed a video for the next single, [...] "Change the World", but it was never shipped to MTV. However, it did air on the lesser known Fuse TV. The album's relatively poor sales compared to P.O.D.'s mammoth success, Satellite, have been partly attributed to a shakeup at Atlantic Records, leaving P.O.D. with no label support. Atlantic was sold to a private investor resulting in several thousand people, many of whom close to P.O.D., losing their jobs.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> (abbreviated P.O.D.) is a Christian nu metal band {{formed in}} 1992 and based in San Diego, California. The band's line-up {{consists}} of vocalist Sonny Sandoval, drummer Wuv Bernardo, guitarist Marcos Curiel, and bassist Traa Daniels. They have sold over 12 million records worldwide. Over {{the course of}} their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. With their third studio album, The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, they achieved their initial mainstream success; the album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2000. Their following studio album, Satellite, continued the band's success with the singles, [...] "Alive" [...] and [...] "Youth of the Nation", pushing it to go triple platinum.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> saw {{the band}} {{head in a}} more {{traditional}} metal sound and away from their well-known nu metal style which was losing popularity by 2003. It has been considered an overall darker approach than its predecessor. Vocalist Sonny Sandoval also utilizes {{a considerable amount of}} reggae style delivery throughout the album, namely in tracks such as [...] "Change the World", [...] "Execute the Sounds", and [...] "Revolution", while Sandoval's typical rapping is largely deemphasized. The band's longtime hip hop influence, however, is not entirely absent; a verse from [...] "Execute the Sounds" [...] borrows the chorus, in altered form, from the Boogie Down Productions song [...] "Stop the Violence" [...] off their 1988 album By All Means Necessary.|$|R
50|$|The Finance Acts 1894 and 1909 {{effected}} large {{changes in}} the duties <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>death.</b> As regards the succession duties they enacted that payment of the estate duties thereby created should include payment of the additional duties mentioned above. Estates under £1,000 (£2,000 {{in the case of}} widow or child of deceased) are exempted from payment of any succession duties. The succession duty payable under the Succession Duty Act 1853 was in all cases to be calculated according to the principal value of the property, i.e., its selling value, and though still payable by instalments interest at 3% is chargeable. The additional succession duties are still payable in cases where the estate duty is not charged, but such cases are of small importance and in practice are not as a rule charged.|$|R
5000|$|Yearning {{for a fresh}} start, {{the group}} rented a {{practice}} space in San Diego and started jamming with no expectations and no deadlines. Vocalist Sonny Sandoval explained, [...] "We took {{it back to the}} roots. We broke down the walls in this abandoned warehouse and set up shop. The doors were always open to our friends and family and people around San Diego to come through. And it was just more of a home vibe." [...] According to bassist Traa Daniels, [...] "It was innocent and it was natural and fun." [...] Within the first month of recording, P.O.D. had an unprecedented 17 songs to work with. The group also decided <b>on</b> the title <b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> both {{to set the record straight}} regarding the band's initials and as a symbol of their rebirth.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of <b>Payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>Death</b> Live, Essential Records offered P.O.D. a $100,000 {{recording}} contract, but on behalf of the band Sandoval told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, [...] "God has a bigger plan for P.O.D." [...] When, in 1998, Atlantic Records A John Rubeli first came across P.O.D.'s demo he [...] "didn't quite get it", as he later told HitQuarters. It was only when he saw them play live at The Roxy on the Sunset Strip and witnessed not just an enthusiastic audience singing every word but the center of a vibrant youth movement that he became convinced by the band. The band was quickly signed to a major-label deal. P.O.D. soon released The Warriors EP, a tribute EP to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.|$|R
