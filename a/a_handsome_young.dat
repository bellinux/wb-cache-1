At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal.

She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E

25|$|As Maria Isabella was {{determined}} to remarry, her son, King Ferdinand II, gave her a list with names of young noblemen of the kingdom, from whom to choose. Her first two choices hesitated and she withdrew her proposals. Ultimately she selected Francesco, Count dal Balzo dei Duchi di Presenzano (1805–1882), <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> lieutenant from an ancient but impoverished noble family. Their marriage took place privately on 15 January 1839. She was 50 years old and the groom, 34. The couple had no children.

25|$|There is {{the tale}} (p.28 ff.) of the arrow that landed at al-Mansur's feet with verses inscribed {{in each of}} the three {{feathers}} and along the shaft causing him to investigate the unjust imprisonment of a distinguished notable from Hamadan.

25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E

On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the three fairies ask Rose to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her.

He races to find the owner of the beautiful voice and is instantly struck by Rose's grace and beauty. Briar Rose at first is frightened at his sudden appearance, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but Philip soon puts her at ease. They instantly fall in love, unaware of being promised in marriage sixteen years ago. Briar Rose asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family.|$|E
25|$|In May 1950, the Gilberton {{publishing}} company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs {{as part of}} their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at the sides of his mouth. As this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics Illustrated edition, with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics edition.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> prince {{lives in}} a luxurious castle in France. He has {{everything}} he ever wanted, and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the freezing cold, with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could learn to love a woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{believes}} [...] "The Snowman" [...] was {{the product}} in part of Andersen’s [...] "pining and discontent over" [...] Harald Scharff, <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> dancer at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen.

500|$|The {{covers of}} The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series {{represent}} further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed {{on the covers}} of The Nancy Drew Files is [...] "a markedly sexy Nancy, with <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous." [...] In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip {{across the top of the}} cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.|$|E

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man is a quasi-prequel to House of Horrors, {{in which}} Hatton played a {{deformed}} madman named [...] "The Creeper" [...] who kills people by breaking their backs. In The Brute Man Hatton also plays [...] "The Creeper", while the story explains how he became deformed {{and why he}} has a murderous personality. Hatton also played a disfigured killer called the Huxton Creeper in The Pearl of Death, a 1944 Sherlock Holmes film, but neither House of Horrors nor The Brute Man have any connection to that film. In establishing a backstory explaining the Creeper's motives, The Brute Mans script seeks to humanize the character and elicit more sympathy for him than the Creeper's other films, {{in which he is}} generally portrayed as a two-dimensional murderer. The origin of the Creeper is based partially on autobiographical details from Hatton's real life. Before becoming disfigured by an accident, the Creeper was <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> <b>young</b> college football hero. Hatton himself was also a football player at the University of Florida before suffering from the effects of acromegaly, a syndrome that causes abnormal bone growth due to excess growth hormone from the pituitary gland. In the film, the character is disfigured by chemicals during a laboratory accident in school. While Hatton's real-life abnormalities stemmed from acromegaly, it was often incorrectly stated by Universal Pictures publicity materials that they were the result of exposure to mustard gas attacks during Hatton's service in World War I.|$|E
