40|$|INTERA is {{currently}} working with Santa Fe County, New Mexico, to develop a regional groundwater availability model and decision support system (DSS) to assist the County in evaluating potential well locations for new water supply sources. The groundwater availability model {{will be used as}} part of a site suitability <b>analysis</b> <b>DSS</b> using multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) to determine potential supply well locations. Using a geographic information systems (GIS) approach, the DSS will identify potential supply well locations for the County that minimize impacts (and hence proximity) to existing supply wells, streams, and springs, while maximizing proximity to existing infrastructure, population centers, and areas of favorable geology and land ownership using a MAUT approach. As a final step, potential supply well locations will be evaluated using the groundwater availability model to further refine the location alternatives to identify the most promising ones. This approach will provide County decision-makers and the public with a structured, scientifically defensible, and unbiased method of identifying potential supply well locations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The current {{interest}} in water quality improvement plans {{across the country}} and the wide range of stakeholder involvement have imposed a new paradigm for developing scientifically robust and technically sound software tools for water quality monitoring and assessment. Trend detection {{is an essential part of}} water quality assessment, which can help with identifying causal factors for the impairment of water quality, confirming the effectiveness of management actions and establishing a need for management intervention. Discovery of temporal water quality trends is a complex process due to the characteristics of water quality data (non-normal distribution of data, seasonality, flow interactions, missing values, values below the limit of detection, and serial correlation). The preparation of time series data sets and the checking for suitability of available data for trend detection are essential prerequisites for trend assessment. We have designed and developed a user friendly decision support system (DSS) for water quality trend assessment to assist and improve water quality data analysis by various stakeholders including catchment groups and regional bodies. This DSS is a component of a water quality data analysis package developed by eWater CRC. The trend <b>analysis</b> <b>DSS</b> contains steps of data validation, consideration of detection limits, time series data management, statistical testing, modelling and decision-making to help explain the trends. This tool can import time series data from a variety of formats and databases. The tool comes with advance...|$|E

However, outcome data of adults with RMS are scarce. This multicenter retrospective study investigated the effect of age on outcome of RMS. Patients and Methods: Data were collected from three Dutch University Medical Centers between 1977 - 2009. The effect of age and clinical prognostic factors on relapse-free and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed. Results: Age as a continuous variable predicted poor survival in multivariate <b>analysis.</b> Five-year <b>DSS</b> was highest for non-metastatic embryonal RMS, followed by non-metastatic alveolar RMS and was poor in metastatic disease. Higher age correlated with unfavorable histological subtype (alveolar RMS) and with metastatic disease at presentation in embryonal RMS. In non-metastatic embryonal RMS and in all alveolar RMS, higher age was an adverse prognostic factor of outcome. Conclusion: This study indicates that age is a negative predictor of survival in patients with embryonal and alveolar RMS...|$|R

However, prediction of invasive species using SDMs {{can be challenging}} because they typically violatethe core assumption of being at equilibrium with their environment, which may lead to poorly guidedmanagement resulting from high levels of omission.

We used presence-only data and expert knowledge for model calibration andpresence/absence data to evaluate the potential distribution of an introduced mesquite (Leguminoseae:Prosopis) invasion located in the Pilbara Region of northwest Western Australia. Five different DSs withvarying levels of conservatism/risk were derived from a multi-criteria evaluation model using orderedweighted averaging. The performance of DSs over all possible thresholds was examined using receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) <b>analysis.</b> <b>DSs</b> not on the convex hull of the ROC curves were discarded. Twothreshold determination methods (TDMs) were compared on the two remaining DSs, one that assumedequilibrium (by maximizing overall prediction success) and another that assumed the invasion was ongoing(using a 95 % threshold for true positives). The most conservative DS fitted the validation data mostclosely but could only predict 75 % of the presence data. A more risk-taking DS could predict 95 % of thepresence data, which identified 8. 5 times more area for surveillance, and better highlighted known populationsthat are still rapidly invading. ThisDSandTDMcoupling was considered to be the most appropriatefor our management application. Our results show that predictive niche modeling was highly sensitiveto risk levels, but that these can be tailored to match specified management objectives.

However, our knowledge on bacteriophage which infects the Roseobacter clade is still very limited. Here, we report a new bacteriophage, phage DSS 3 Phi 8, which infects marine roseobacter Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS- 3. DSS 3 Phi 8 is a lytic siphovirus. Genomic <b>analysis</b> showed that <b>DSS</b> 3 Phi 8 is most closely related {{to a group of}} siphoviruses, CbK-like phages, which infect freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. DSS 3 Phi 8 contains a smaller capsid and has a reduced genome size (146 kb) compared to the CbK-like phages (205 - 279 kb). DSS 3 Phi 8 contains the DNA polymerase gene which is closely related to T 7 -like podoviruses. DSS 3 Phi 8 also contains the integrase and repressor genes, indicating its potential to involve in lysogenic cycle. In addition, four GTA (gene transfer agent) genes were identified in the DSS 3 Phi 8 genome.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Papillary or {{follicular}} thyroid carcinomas {{exhibit a}} relatively benign course. Hence, long-term follow-up studies with well-defined disease stages and treatment details {{are needed to}} evaluate treatment strategies. METHODS: Patients who underwent complete resection of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) confined to the thyroid gland between 1972 and 1990 identified from a prospective database were assessed. Follow-up was performed by interview, review of patient charts, {{and analysis of the}} Death Registry. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Review of histology was performed and extent of thyroid resection, postoperative therapy, and recognized prognostic factors but not lymphadenectomy were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 2, 867 patients, 213 had complete resection of WDTC confined to the thyroid gland. Follow-up was completed in 166 patients with median age 54. 2 (range, 20 - 85) years, and median follow-up of 27. 2 (range, 15. 6 - 34. 5) years. The 10 - and 20 -year OS was 71 and 55 %, respectively. DSS at 10 and 20 years was 81 and 69 %, respectively, and correlated with age, histology, tumor size, radio-iodide ablation (RIA), and external beam irradiation (EBR) treatment. No patient died of WDTC more than 18 years after resection. Total or near-total thyroidectomy without lymphadenectomy was not superior to partial thyroidectomy. In multivariate <b>analysis</b> for <b>DSS,</b> age was the dominant factor, which correlated with histology.

Sixty-eight sera spotted onto filter papers (Whatman International Ltd., United Kingdom) were used for detection of total anti-HAV antibodies, and 64 sera were used for detection of immunoglobulin M antibody to HAV. DSS were stored at 4 °C, room temperature, and 37 °C for 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Sensitivity and specificity of the serological assays were 100 % regardless of temperature and storage duration. To assess the stability of HAV RNA, we performed qualitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCRs (RT-PCRs) with human plasma spiked with serial dilutions of cultured HAV spotted on Flinders Technology Associates filter paper cards (Whatman International Ltd.). Filter papers were stored at room temperature and processed for RT-PCR assays. No reduction of viral load was observed after 5, 15, and 30 days of storage. The ∼ 10 -fold reduction of sensitivity from DSS was attributable to a smaller sample input in DSS samples. This method was further evaluated using 35 frozen sera. HAV RNA amplification showed 100 % specificity and 92. 3 % sensitivity, and sequence <b>analysis</b> from <b>DSS</b> and sera provided identical results.

40|$|Abstract Background In general, {{prognosis}} {{and impact}} of prognostic/predictive factors are assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots and/or the Cox proportional hazard model. There might be substantive differences from the results using these models for the same patients, if different statistical methods were used, for example, Boag log-normal (cure-rate model), or log-normal survival analysis. Methods Cohort of 244 limited-stage small-cell lung cancer patients, were accrued between 1981 and 1998, and followed {{to the end of}} 2005. The endpoint was death with or from lung cancer, for disease-specific survival (DSS). DSS at 1 -, 3 - and 5 -years, with 95 % confidence limits, are reported for all patients using the Boag, Kaplan-Meier, Cox, and log-normal survival analysis methods. Factors with significant effects on DSS were identified with step-wise forward multivariate Cox and log-normal survival analyses. Then, DSS was ascertained for patients with specific characteristics defined by these factors. Results The median follow-up of those alive was 9. 5 years. The lack of events after 1966 days precluded comparison after 5 years. DSS assessed by the four methods in the full cohort differed by 0 – 2 % at 1 year, 0 – 12 % at 3 years, and 0 – 1 % at 5 years. Log-normal survival <b>analysis</b> indicated <b>DSS</b> of 38 % at 3 years, 10 – 12 % higher than with other methods; univariate 95 % confidence limits were non-overlapping. Surgical resection, hemoglobin level, lymph node involvement, and superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction significantly impacted DSS. DSS assessed by the Cox and log-normal survival analysis methods for four clinical risk groups differed by 1 – 6 % at 1 year, 15 – 26 % at 3 years, and 0 – 12 % at 5 years; multivariate 95 % confidence limits were overlapping in all instances. Conclusion Surgical resection, hemoglobin level, lymph node involvement, and superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction all significantly impacted DSS. Apparent DSS for patients was influenced by the statistical methods of assessment. This would be clinically relevant in the development or improvement of clinical management strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method, {{which can}} provide diagnostic information on children with brain tumours. The technique {{has not been}} widely used in clinical practice, {{partly because of the}} difficulty of developing robust classifiers from small patient numbers and the challenge of providing decision support systems (DSSs) acceptable to clinicians. This paper describes a participatory design approach in the development of an interactive clinical user interface, as part of a distributed DSS for the diagnosis and prognosis of brain tumours. In particular, we consider the clinical need and context of developing interactive elements for an interface that facilitates the classification of childhood brain tumours, for diagnostic purposes, as part of the HealthAgents European Union project. Previous MRS-based DSS tools have required little input from the clinician user and a raw spectrum is essentially processed to provide a diagnosis sometimes with an estimate of error. In childhood brain tumour diagnosis where there are small numbers of cases and a large number of potential diagnoses, this approach becomes intractable. The involvement of clinicians directly in the designing of the DSS for brain tumour diagnosis from MRS led to an alternative approach with the creation of a flexible DSS that, allows the clinician to input prior information to create the most relevant differential diagnosis for the DSS. This approach mirrors that which is currently taken by clinicians and removes many sources of potential error. The validity of this strategy was confirmed for a small cohort of children with cerebellar tumours by combining two diagnostic types, pilocytic astrocytomas (11 cases) and ependymomas (four cases) into a class of glial tumours which then had similar numbers to the other diagnostic type, medulloblastomas (18 cases). Principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis on magnetic resonance spectral data gave a classification accuracy of 91 % for a three-class classifier and 94 % for a two-class classifier using a leave-one-out <b>analysis.</b> This <b>DSS</b> provides a flexible method for the clinician to use MRS for brain tumour diagnosis in children...|$|R

Methods: Cohort of 244 limited-stage small-cell lung cancer patients, were accrued between 1981 and 1998, and followed {{to the end of}} 2005. The endpoint was death with or from lung cancer, for disease-specific survival (DSS). DSS at 1 -, 3 - and 5 -years, with 95 % confidence limits, are reported for all patients using the Boag, Kaplan-Meier, Cox, and log-normal survival analysis methods. Factors with significant effects on DSS were identified with step-wise forward multivariate Cox and log-normal survival analyses. Then, DSS was ascertained for patients with specific characteristics defined by these factors. Results: The median follow-up of those alive was 9. 5 years. The lack of events after 1966 days precluded comparison after 5 years. DSS assessed by the four methods in the full cohort differed by 0 - 2 % at 1 year, 0 - 12 % at 3 years, and 0 - 1 % at 5 years. Log-normal survival <b>analysis</b> indicated <b>DSS</b> of 38 % at 3 years, 10 - 12 % higher than with other methods; univariate 95 % confidence limits were non-overlapping. Surgical resection, hemoglobin level, lymph node involvement, and superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction significantly impacted DSS. DSS assessed by the Cox and log-normal survival analysis methods for four clinical risk groups differed by 1 - 6 % at 1 year, 15 - 26 % at 3 years, and 0 - 12 % at 5 years; multivariate 95 % confidence limits were overlapping in all instances. Conclusion: Surgical resection, hemoglobin level, lymph node involvement, and superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction all significantly impacted DSS. Apparent DSS for patients was influenced by the statistical methods of assessment. This would be clinically relevant in the development or improvement of clinical management strategies...|$|R

A fundamental step is the system conceptual model building. In simple problems basic mathematics is enough. In more complex problem it is impossible to manage the mathematic solution and for this reason the simulation is used. Scope of simulation is to schematize reality reflecting it faithfully. It can be discrete or continue. In the first case, dependent variables change discretely for particular time values simulated, in the second case dependent variables can change in continuous manner during the simulation range. Into this article we proceed by steps: in the first section literature review will be shown, referring literatures that have already shown this themes; in the second section we will proceed analyzing the integration among different models and, consequently, the building of model for simulation importance; in third section there will be a focus on simulation concept and difference between discrete and continuous simulation. Purpose In more complex problem it is impossible to manage the mathematic solution and for this reason the simulation is used. Scope of simulation is to schematize reality reflecting it faithfully. In this paper we propose a Hybrid Simulation Model based on the integration to DES and SD.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to use the DINAS (Dynamic Interactive Network <b>Analysis</b> System) <b>DSS</b> to {{determine}} whether Kitchener was the most suitable location for the Freeport Chronic-Care Hospital, within the Province of Ontario. Methods involve determining which sites in Ontario were suitable {{for the construction of}} the Freeport Hospital, and calculating attribute information about those sites. Attribute information included three accessibility indicators: (1) The Average Distance to an Optional Site; (2) Standard Deviation of the Distance to an Optional Site; and (3) the Maximum Distance to an Optional Site. Two utilization pattern variables were also calculated, those being: (1) Population Within the Influence of an Optional Site; and (2) Distance to the Next Nearest Hospital. Data was gathered for two population groups in Ontario, those being: (1) persons 65 years of age or greater; and (2) persons of all ages. DINAS analyzed these attributes and ranked the potential sites in order of suitability. Results indicated that Etobicoke was a more suitable location for the Freeport Hospital than Kitchener. The most suitable site for both study populations, according to the DINAS results, was Etobicoke, Ontario. An in depth discussion of the DINAS ranking of potential locations did indicate that Kitchener may have been the most suitable location for the Freeport Chronic-Care Hospital. The DINAS DSS was found, by the author, to have been useful in a site selection problem of this study 2 ̆ 7 s nature. A number of limitations of the study were found to have contributed to the reduced accuracy of the DINAS analysis. However, recommendations were made by the author so as to reduce these limitations and improve upon the DINAS model. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Geography.

40|$|Most {{decision}} support systems (DSS) contain stored data, data analysis procedures, and decision models. However, many DSS {{have grown to}} the point that the average end user is presented with a bewildering array of information resources that are difficult to manage in an effective manner. As a result users often gravitate to a few familiar models and are unaware of the data resources available to them and how these resources relate to the various models. For example, they may think that a model requires data that is unavailable, when in fact that data has recently been added to the data base or could be calculated from another model. Or they may believe that all of the data needed to execute a set of models is available and find out well into the analysis that it is not. Existing tools for DSS design do not provide an effective and comprehensive foundation for modeling all the components of a DSS, or for addressing all the important <b>DSS</b> <b>analysis</b> and design issues. In this paper we show how a new graph-theoretic structure, called a metagraph, can be used as a unifying basis for addressing many important questions in DSS development and use. model management, {{decision support}} systems, graph theory...|$|R

Using DSS-induced colitis model, which is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of graded dose of arginine (0. 4 %, 0. 8 %, and 1. 5 %) or glutamine (0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 %) supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) ], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 b), IL- 6, IL- 17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) ] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12. Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide- 3 -kinases (PI 3 K) /PI 3 K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) - myosin light chain (MLC 20), were analyzed using immunoblotting.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DV) {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most important mosquito-borne diseases in the tropics. Recently, the severe forms, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), have become the leading cause of death among children in Southern Vietnam. Protective and/or pathogenic T cell immunity is supposed to be important in the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify HLA alleles controlling T cell immunity against dengue virus (DV), we performed a hospital-based case control study at Children's Hospital No. 2, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and Vinh Long Province Hospital (VL) in Southern Vietnam from 2002 to 2005. A total of 211 and 418 patients with DHF and DSS, respectively, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, were analyzed for their characteristic HLA-A, -B and -DRB 1 alleles. Four hundred fifty healthy children (250 from HCMC and 200 from VL) of the same Kinh ethnicity were also analyzed as population background. In HLA class I, frequency of the HLA-A* 24 showed increased tendency in both DHF and DSS patients, which reproduced a previous study. The frequency of A* 24 with histidine at codon 70 (A* 2402 / 03 / 10), based on main anchor binding site specificity <b>analysis</b> in <b>DSS</b> and DHF patients, was significantly higher than that in the population background groups (HCMC 02 - 03 DSS: OR = 1. 89, P = 0. 008, DHF: OR = 1. 75, P = 0. 033; VL 02 - 03 DSS: OR = 1. 70, P = 0. 03, DHF: OR = 1. 46, P = 0. 38; VL 04 - 05 DSS: OR = 2. 09, P = 0. 0075, DHF: OR = 2. 02, P = 0. 038). In HLA class II, the HLA-DRB 1 * 0901 frequency was significantly decreased in secondary infection of DSS in VL 04 - 05 (OR = 0. 35, P = 0. 0025, Pc = 0. 03). Moreover, the frequency of HLA-DRB 1 * 0901 in particular was significantly decreased in DSS when compared with DHF in DEN- 2 infection (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: This study improves our understanding of the risk of HLA-class I for severe outcome of DV infection in the light of peptide anchor binding site and provides novel evidence that HLA-class II may control disease severity (DHF to DSS) in DV infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{decision}} support system (DSS) is an application that analyses data and presents results to users. DSS rapidly shift through huge amount of available data and thus allowing for faster analysis of condition monitoring data early detection of faults and improved allocation of resources. DSS can also predict and plan for future ship operators? needs in order to optimize ship machinery operations. Such a system can provide substantial benefits to the maritime industry in terms of energy efficiency as {{the operation of the}} vessel can be optimised towards this end. As part of the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) EU FP 7 project, this paper presents a novel DSS solution which interrogates data from dynamic condition monitoring and compares them with historic data to present {{decision support}} information onboard a ship. To provide for Condition Based inspection and criticality based maintenance for ship machinery, data is acquired and stored for <b>analysis</b> through the <b>DSS.</b> Moreover surveys involving off-line and real time on-line measurement approaches are combined to provide a more complete monitoring method. The result is a reliable user friendly graphical interface (GUI) developed in Java language that can be employed onboard any vessel and can provide relevant and on-time information. The proposed actions from the DSS target energy efficient operation and reduction of fuel consumption and ship emissions. Moreover, a major factor taken into account through the prediction mechanism of the DSS is to assist in better spare parts scheduling and prioritizing ship inspection, maintenance and repairs towards enhanced and efficient ship operations...|$|R
40|$|Emergency Management and Operations (EMO) {{personnel}} {{are in need}} of resources and tools to assist in understanding the health risks associated with dermal exposures during chemical incidents. This article reviews available resources and presents a conceptual framework for a decision support system (DSS) that assists in characterizing and managing risk during chemical emergencies involving dermal exposures. The framework merges principles of three decision-making techniques: 1) scenario planning, 2) risk analysis, and 3) multicriteria decision <b>analysis</b> (MCDA). This <b>DSS</b> facilitates dynamic decision making during each of the distinct life cycle phases of an emergency incident (ie, preparedness, response, or recovery) and identifies EMO needs. A checklist tool provides key questions intended to guide users through the complexities of conducting a dermal risk assessment. The questions define the scope of the framework for resource identification and application to support decision-making needs. The framework consists of three primary modules: 1) resource compilation, 2) prioritization, and 3) decision. The modules systematically identify, organize, and rank relevant information resources relating to the hazards of dermal exposures to chemicals and risk management strategies. Each module is subdivided into critical elements designed to further delineate the resources based on relevant incident phase and type of information. The DSS framework provides a much needed structure based on contemporary decision analysis principles for 1) documenting key questions for EMO problem formulation and 2) a method for systematically organizing, screening, and prioritizing information resources on dermal hazards, exposures, risk characterization, and management.

50|$|In the 1960s, {{scientists}} deliberately started {{examining the}} utilization of automated quantitative models to help with basic decision making and planning. Automated decision support systems have become more of real time scenarios with the advancement of minicomputers, timeshare working frameworks and distributed computing. The historical backdrop of the execution of such frameworks starts in the mid-1960s. In a technology field as assorted as DSS, chronicling history is neither slick nor direct. Diverse individuals see the field of decision Support Systems from different vantage focuses and report distinctive records of what happened and what was important. As technology emerged new automated decision support applications were created and worked upon. Scientists utilized multiple frameworks to create and comprehend these applications. Today one can arrange the historical backdrop of DSS into the five expansive DSS classes,including: communications-driven, data-driven, document driven, knowledge-driven and model-driven decision support systems. Model-driven spatial decision support system (SDSS) {{was developed in the}} late 1980s and by 1995 the SDSS idea {{had turned out to be}} recognized in the literature. Data driven spatial DSS are also quite regular. All in all, a data-driven DSS stresses access to and control of a time-series of internal organization information and sometimes external and current data. Executive Information Systems are cases of data driven DSS.The very first cases of these frameworks were called data-oriented <b>DSS,</b> <b>analysis</b> Information Systems and recovery. Communications-driven DSS utilize networks and communications technologies to facilitate decision-relevant collaboration and communication. In these frameworks, communications technologies are the overwhelming design segment. Devices utilized incorporate groupware, video conferencing and computer-based bulletin boards.|$|R
