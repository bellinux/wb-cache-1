5|$|As well {{as being}} an <b>astronomer,</b> Gascoigne was a scholar {{of the history of}} Australian astronomy. He wrote {{histories}} of major telescopes, such as the Melbourne Telescope and the AAT. He wrote biographies for the Australian Dictionary of Biography, including those of the first trained <b>astronomer</b> at Canberra's Mount Stromlo Observatory, William Bolton Rimmer, and pioneering Australian <b>astronomer</b> Robert Ellery.|$|E
5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English <b>astronomer</b> Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English <b>astronomer</b> William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French <b>astronomer</b> Camille Flammarion and the English <b>astronomer</b> Nathan Green.|$|E
40|$|The Biographical Encyclopedia of <b>Astronomers</b> is {{a unique}} and {{valuable}} resource for historians and <b>astronomers</b> alike. It includes approx. 1850 biographical sketches on <b>astronomers</b> from antiquity to modern times. It is the collective work of 430 authors edited by an editorial board of 8 historians and <b>astronomers.</b> This reference provides biographical information on <b>astronomers</b> and cosmologists by utilizing contemporary historical scholarship. The fully corrected and updated second edition adds approximately 300 biographical sketches. Based on ongoing research and feedback from the community, the new entries will fill gaps and provide expansions. In addition, greater emphasis on Russo phone <b>astronomers</b> and radio <b>astronomers</b> is given. Individual entries vary from 100 to 1500 words, including the likes of the super luminaries such as Newton and Einstein, as well as lesser-known <b>astronomers</b> like Galileo's acolyte, Mario Guiducci...|$|R

5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, {{it is still possible}} for the amateur <b>astronomer</b> to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur <b>astronomer</b> Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|Alan Hale, an <b>astronomer</b> and co-discoverer of Comet Hale-Bopp, {{grew up in}} Alamogordo {{and lives}} in nearby Cloudcroft.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and <b>astronomer</b> Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled {{two pairs}} of stars close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American <b>astronomer</b> Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis as he felt its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
50|$|Chinese and Arabic {{astronomy}} intermingled under Mongol rule. Muslim <b>astronomers</b> {{worked in}} the Chinese Astronomical Bureau established by Kublai Khan, while some Chinese <b>astronomers</b> also worked at the Persian Maragha observatory.

5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German <b>astronomer</b> Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed}} a custom photometer {{to measure the}} reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French <b>astronomer</b> Pierre Janssen and British <b>astronomer</b> William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German <b>astronomer</b> Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English <b>astronomer</b> Edward W. Maunder in 1875, but would later come into question.|$|E
5|$|Cedric Wright {{was born}} and raised in Alameda, California. His father was a {{successful}} attorney, and one of his father's clients was <b>astronomer</b> Charles Hitchcock Adams, Ansel Adams's father. Cedric's uncle, William Hammond Wright, was an <b>astronomer</b> who became head of Lick Observatory. As a result of his father's success, Wright was financially comfortable throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur <b>astronomer</b> the Reverend Thomas John Hussey {{reported}} a conversation he had had with French <b>astronomer</b> Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British <b>Astronomer</b> Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Messier Catalogue, a number of galaxies have been identified by different historians, professional <b>astronomers,</b> and amateur <b>astronomers</b> as corresponding to M102.|$|R
5|$|Greek <b>astronomer,</b> Andronicus of Cyrrhus, {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} the Tower of the Winds in Athens in the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The English <b>astronomer</b> John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars. Further discoveries paralleled the {{improvements}} in the size {{and quality of the}} telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by Lacaille. The <b>astronomer</b> William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} <b>astronomer</b> {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German <b>astronomer</b> Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American <b>astronomer</b> Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E
40|$|The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an {{international}} attempt to collect astronomical data (images, simulation, mission-logs, etc), organize it and develop tools that let <b>astronomers</b> access this huge amount of information.

5|$|Triton was {{discovered}} by British <b>astronomer</b> William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17days after the discovery of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the Milky Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian <b>astronomer</b> Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble {{used the}} luminosity–period {{relation}} for Cepheids together with spectral shifts first measured by fellow <b>astronomer</b> Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory {{to determine that}} the universe is expanding (see Hubble's law).|$|E
50|$|In 1966, the James Cook <b>Astronomers</b> Club (as SASI {{was then}} known) and the Canberra Astronomical Society met to discuss holding a {{convention}} for amateur <b>astronomers</b> across Australia. These discussions {{resulted in the}} first National Australian Convention of Amateur <b>Astronomers</b> (NACAA) being held over Easter 1967 at the Australian National University in Canberra, jointly hosted by the James Cook <b>Astronomers</b> Club and the Pacific Astronomical Society These two clubs merged to form SASI, which has since co-hosted conventions in Katoomba (1966), Canberra (1967), Sydney (1988) and Penrith (2008) and sole hosts in 1998 at Sutherland.|$|R
50|$|<b>Astronomers</b> have {{identified}} ethyl formate in dust clouds {{in an area}} of the Milky Way galaxy called Sagittarius B2. The <b>astronomers,</b> from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, used the 30 metre IRAM radiotelescope in Spain to analyse the spectra of radiation emitted from hot regions near a new star. It is among 50 molecules identified by the <b>astronomers.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century <b>astronomers</b> {{began to}} change from named eras to {{numerical}} signs, with some <b>astronomers</b> using BC/0/AD years while others used −/0/+ years. By the mid 20th century all <b>astronomers</b> were using −/0/+ years. Numerical signs effectively form a new era, reducing the confusion inherent in any date which uses an astronomical year with an era named Before Christ.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and <b>astronomer</b> Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair {{of stars}} close together Lambda Tucanae, {{and a group of}} three stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American <b>astronomer</b> Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, and it is now known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by Francis Baily, who felt the star was too faint to warrant a designation, and Kappa's two components {{came to be known as}} Kappa1 and Kappa2.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. <b>Astronomer</b> and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief <b>astronomer</b> of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of scientific contributions by amateur <b>astronomers</b> {{are in the}} area of data collection. In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur <b>astronomers</b> with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional <b>astronomers.</b> Several organizations, such as the American Association of Variable Star Observers, exist to help coordinate these contributions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth century Tamil <b>astronomers</b> were found to make astronomical calculations, {{reckoning}} with shells using a mixture of decimal and sexagesimal notations developed by Hellenistic <b>astronomers.</b>|$|R
50|$|While <b>astronomers</b> had {{detected}} {{more than}} 180 extrasolar planets, XO-1b {{is only the}} tenth planet discovered using the transit method.
