This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E

5|$|Samaras is also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dribbler. This {{is due to}} his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson {{said that he would}} only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become <b>a</b> <b>good</b> player.|$|E
