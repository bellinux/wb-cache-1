Between 1941-47 Naumburg worked at NY State Psychiatric Institute with adults and children and later published a series of case studies where she art for diagnosis and therapy in the institution (Rubin, 2010, p. 59)[...] However she {{was not alone in}} this endeavor. She was unique in using it as a primary agent rather than an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tool.</b> She called her approach Dynamically Oriented Art Therapy based primarily on Freudian theory.The dynamic oriented approach was her main contribution to the art therapy community. This approach promotes [...] " [...] the release of spontaneous imagery" [...] from the client through the symbols drawn and free association of the artworks (Rubin, 2010, p. 145). Naumburg viewed Art Therapy as a distinctive form of psychotherapy. She was also sympathetic to Jungian notions of universal symbolism and Harry Stack Sullivan's ideas about interpersonal psychiatry. Building off the work of Freud and Jung, Naumburg explored the inner personal meaning of symbols. Naumburg insisted the only valid interpretation of anyone's art came from the creator. She was skeptical about simple or rigid approaches to [...] meaning consistent with Freud's teaching about dream analysis.Naumburg wrote “when art teachings are routine it discourages efforts at spontaneous and creative expression forcing pupils” (Naumburg, 1973, p. 137) to recreate what they already know is good.|$|E
