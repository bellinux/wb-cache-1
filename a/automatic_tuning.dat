40|$|SUMMARY In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} to GridFTP that optimizes its performance by dynamically adjusting {{the number of}} parallel TCP connections. GridFTP {{has been used as}} a data transfer protocol to effectively transfer a large volume of data in Grid computing. GridFTP supports a feature called parallel data transfer that improves throughput by establishing multiple TCP connections in parallel. However, for achieving high GridFTP throughput, the number of TCP connections should be optimized based on the network status. In this paper, we propose an <b>automatic</b> parallelism <b>tuning</b> mechanism called GridFTP-APT (GridFTP with <b>Automatic</b> Parallelism <b>Tuning)</b> that adjusts the number of parallel TCP connections according to information available to the Grid middleware. Through simulations, we demonstrate that GridFTP-APT significantly improves the performance of GridFTP in various network environments. key words: <b>automatic</b> parallelism <b>tuning,</b> Golden Section Search method, Grid computing, GridFTP, GridFTP-APT, parallel TCP connections, parameter tunin...|$|R

50|$|The pentagrid {{converter}} {{in either}} guise operated extremely well, but it {{suffered from the}} limitation that a strong signal was able to 'pull' the oscillator frequency away from a weaker signal. This was not considered {{a major problem in}} broadcast receivers where the signals were likely to be strong, but it became a problem when trying to receive weak signals that were close to strong signals. Some short wave radios managed quite satisfactorily with these devices. Special high frequency versions appeared after World War II for the 100 MHz FM bands. Examples are the 6SB7Y (1946) and the 6BA7 (1948). The pulling effect had a beneficial side effect in that it gave a degree of <b>automatic</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{practice}} {{systems with}} parameter determination require considerable {{time to find}} an optimum tuning, i.e. time necessary for self-tuning in such systems is bounded from below. Self-tuning systems without parameter determination do not have this disadvantage. In such systems, some characteristic of control quality is used (e.g., the first time derivative of a controlled parameter). <b>Automatic</b> <b>tuning</b> makes sure that this characteristic is kept within given bounds. Different self-tuning systems without parameter determination exist {{that are based on}} controlling transitional processes, frequency characteristics, etc. All of those are examples of closed-circuit self-tuning systems, whereby parameters are automatically corrected every time the quality characteristic value falls outside the allowable bounds. In contrast, open-circuit self-tuning systems are systems with para-metrical compensation, whereby input signal itself is controlled and system parameters are changed according to a specified procedure. This type of self-tuning can be close to instantaneous. However, in order to realise such self-tuning one needs to control the environment in which the system operates and a good enough understanding of how the environment influences the controlled system is required.|$|E

The studied SIMD instruction set extensions include Intel’s SSE family, AMD’s 3 DNow!, Motorola’s AltiVec, and IBM’s BlueGene/L SIMD instructions. FFTW, ATLAS, and SPIRAL demonstrate that near-optimal performance of numerical kernels across a variety of modern computers featuring deep memory hierarchies can be achieved only by means of <b>automatic</b> performance <b>tuning.</b> These software packages generate and optimize ANSI C code and feed it into the target machine’s general purpose C compiler to maintain portability.
