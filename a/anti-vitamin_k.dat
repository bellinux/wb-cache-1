Simultaneosly whole blood PT-INR and activated prothrombin partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was checked with a bedside point-of-care HEMOCHRON Jr with blood from the citrated vacutainer test tubes, before these were sent to the laboratory. Both types of PT were checked 10 minutes after the intravenous PCC injection. The correlation coefficient between routine citrated plasma PT and the whole blood citrated HEMOCHRON® PT was 0, 88 (p> 0, 001). All patients underwent surgery within 24 hours. No plasma was used.

40|$|Oral {{anticoagulant}} {{therapy has}} changed little since {{the development of}} the coumarin drugs after the Second World War. The basic nature of the therapy, i. e. the balancing between thrombosis and haemorrhage, makes it a therapy difficult to manage. Add to this the many influences from co-morbidity, co-medication, diet, metabolism, etc, and it becomes clear that there is little inherent stability to coumarin <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> treatment. The studies included in this thesis were	set up to look at different ways in which the quality of oral anticoagulant treatment can be improved. We looked at the percentage of time spent within the predefined INR target range with different coumarins (acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon), at patient self-management to further improve treatment quality in the setting of a highly structured system of anticoagulation clinics and the effects of this treatment modality on {{the quality of life of}} the patients.

40|$|Background.  Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) mostly occurs after spontaneous low-grade bacteremia. Thus, IE {{cannot be}} prevented by circumstantial antibiotic prophylaxis. Platelet activation following bacterial-fibrinogen interaction or thrombin-mediated fibrinogen-fibrin polymerization {{is a critical}} step in vegetation formation. We tested the efficacy of antiplatelet and antithrombin to prevent experimental IE. Methods.  A rat model of experimental IE following prolonged low-grade bacteremia mimicking smoldering bacteremia in humans was used. Prophylaxis with antiplatelets (aspirin, ticlopidine [alone or in combination], eptifibatide, or abciximab) or anticoagulants (antithrombin dabigatran etexilate or <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> acenocoumarol) was started 2 days before inoculation with Streptococcus gordonii or Staphylococcus aureus. Valve infection was assessed 24 hours later. Results.  Aspirin plus ticlopidine, as well as abciximab, protected 45 %- 88 % of animals against S. gordonii and S. aureus IE (P <. 05). Dabigatran etexilate protected 75 % of rats against IE due to S. aureus (P <. 005) but failed to protect against S. gordonii (< 30 % protection). Acenocoumarol was ineffective. Conclusions.  Antiplatelet and direct antithrombin agents {{may be useful in}} the prophylaxis of IE in humans. In particular, the potential dual benefit of dabigatran etexilate might be reconsidered for patients with prosthetic valves, who require life-long anticoagulation and in whom S. aureus IE is associated with high mortalit...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) in patients on <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> (AVK) regimen requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: Between February 2006 and February 2008, 138 consecutive patients under chronic AVK treatment were enrolled in this registry. Of them, 122 received bare metal stent implantation and 16 received drug eluting stent implantation. The duration of DAT, on top of AVK treatment, was decided {{at the discretion of}} the clinician. Adequate duration of DAT was defined according to type of stent implanted and to its clinical indication. RESULTS: The baseline clinical characteristics of patients reflect their high risk, with high incidence of comorbid conditions (Charlson score &#x 2265; 3 in 89 % of the patients). At a mean follow-up of 17 1; 11 mo, 22. 9 % of patients developed a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) : 12. 6 % died from cardiovascular disease and almost 6 % had an acute myocardial infarction. Major hemorrhagic events were observed in 7. 4 %. Adequate DAT was obtained in only 44 % of patients. In the multivariate analysis, no adequate DAT and Charlson score were the only independent predictors of MACE (both P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Patients on chronic AVK therapy represent a high risk population and suffer from a high MACE rate after PCI. An adequate DAT regimen and absence of comorbid conditions are strongly associated with better clinical outcomes...|$|E

Patients who have had a blood clot or cardiovascular diseases are treated with oral <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> (Warfarin®) to reducing and prevent relapse. Warfarin is also used as a preventive treatment before the disease. An overdose of Warfarin® may cause bleeding-complications and low dose cause blood clotting. The dosage of the drug is controlled by measuring prothrombin in plasma. The aim of this study was to investigate if prothrombin-complex value changes due to re-spinning and re-analysis after six hours. Fitty whole blood samples from warfarin-treated patients were divided into three subgroups, those with protrombinkomplex-values of 2 - 4 (n= 20), > 4 (n= 15) and < 2 (n= 15). The samples were centrifugated and measured (Method A), re-centrifugated and measured (Method B) or re-analysed after six hours (Method C).

40|$|Rodent {{control is}} an {{important}} issue in human health and agriculture. Oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in Indonesia and this is having a major economic and ecological impact. Rodent control in oil palm plantations is based principally on the use of <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> (AVK), the main anticoagulant used being coumatetralyl, a first-generation AVK. We conducted a comparative study in two well established oil palm plantations in Indonesia: (1) one without chemical control in Riau and (2) another with intensive coumatetralyl use on Bangka Island. Rat species were identified by the molecular barcoding method. Susceptibility to coumatetralyl was then assessed within the two populations and we screened for mutations in vkorc 1, which encodes the molecular target of AVK. Different species were found in the two areas: Rattus tiomanicus in Riau, and a mix of R. tanezumi and a close relative one in Bangka. The rats in Riau were much more susceptible to coumatetralyl than those in Bangka. This study is the first to demonstrate physiological tolerance to AVK in these species. vkorc 1 displayed low levels of polymorphism, and no SNP was associated with the hightolerance phenotypes of R. tanezumi clade, even those exposed to very high concentrations (32 9 the effective dose of 0. 36 mg kg- 1). The biochemical basis of this tolerance remains unknown, but may involve the vkorc 1 promoter and/or cytochrome P 450 metabolism. We discuss our results and the selective role of anticoagulant use in the occurrence of phenotypic tolerance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} ABO blood group and thrombosis, we studied 127 patients taking oral <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> drugs for thromboembolism prophylaxis and compared them with 700 voluntary blood donors. There were 68 patients with venous thrombosis (VT) - 68 with deep vein thrombosis and 8 with pulmonary embolism-and 51 patients with arterial embolism (AE). There were 61 men and 66 women. Mean age at diagnosis was lower for all women, regardless of if they had VT or AE (43 years) than for men (55 years; Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0. 01). There was an imbalance between blood group A and O frequencies in patients with VT versus blood donors, with a higher frequency of blood group A or a lower frequency of blood group O, represented by a high A/O ratio. A/O ratio for blood donors was 0. 63; it was 1. 50 for men (Fisher test, p = 0. 028) and 1. 44 for women (Fisher test, p = 0. 010). Patients with AE showed the same discrepancy, but it was significant for women (A/O = 2. 25; Fisher test, p = 0. 026) and not for men (A/O = 0. 86; Fisher test, p = 0. 836), suggesting that men with AE might have other risk factors for thrombosis.

40|$|International audienceThromboembolic {{events are}} an {{increasingly}} commonly recognized secondary complications in children treated for serious, life-threatening primary diseases. Nevertheless {{the incidence of}} venous thromboembolic disease remains 100 times less frequent in hospitalized children than hospitalized adults, as recent data suggest an incidence of 5, 3 / 10. 000 pediatric patients compared to an incidence of 2, 5 - 5 / 100 in adult patients. Diseases usually associated with thromboembolic events in children are neoplasia, autoimmune or cardiac malformative disease. Contrarily to what is observed in the adult, the majority of deep vein thrombosis events occur at the upper limbs veins, usually {{at the place where}} devices for venous access like port-a-cath or central venous lines are inserted. Because of the relatively low incidence of venous thromboembolic events in children, the diagnostic approach used are largely extrapolated from guidelines obtained from adult studies. However, the diagnostic performances of some diagnostic tools like Doppler-Ultrasound are probably diminished in children. Moreover, the concept of developmental hemostasis, which stresses the point that the hemostatic system in children {{is quite different from the}} adult one, is widely accepted and clearly suggests that the diagnostic and therapeutic approach in pediatric patients may not be simply extrapolated from data obtained in adult studies. From a more practical point of view, the fact that the hemostatic system in children is a dynamic and evolving system, renders the therapeutic approach quite complex. In particular, doses of anticoagulants vary markedly across the pediatric age. The absence of adapted formulations of commonly used anticoagulants, for example the absence of liquid formulations of <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> drugs, further complicates the administration and the correct monitoring of anticoagulation in children, and may diminish observance in adolescent patients. Even though the concept that "children are not little adults" is nowadays widely accepted, there is an urgent need for prospective studies to better assess the modalities of diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease in this particular population...|$|E
40|$|OPINION STATEMENT: Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{is frequently}} encountered in cancer patients, {{acts as an}} important cause of morbidity and mortality, and may be a predictor of worse prognosis. In cancer patient who have a poor life expectancy, preventing death from pulmonary embolism is the mainstay of treatment. Patients who present with severe hypotension or other clinical manifestations suggestive of critical pulmonary embolism {{and do not have}} contraindications to thrombolysis should promptly be administered thrombolytic drugs. Except for selected cases requiring aggressive therapy, treatment of VTE in patients with cancer should not differ from that of patients without malignancy; the initial treatment should be conducted with adjusted dose of unfractionated heparin (UH), fixed dose of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), or fondaparinux. LMWHs and fondaparinux have the potential to greatly simplify the initial treatment of VTE, making the management of the pathology feasible in an outpatient setting for selected patients. Traditionally, in cancer as well as in non-cancer patients, UH or LMWH or fondaparinux are overlapped by oral anticoagulation, targeted to reach an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2. 0 and 3. 0, and then followed by oral anticoagulants. However, during oral anticoagulant therapy, cancer patients exhibit a two- to fourfold higher risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding complications when compared to non-cancer patients. Studies performed during the current decade have demonstrated that LMWHs offer several advantages in terms of efficacy in preventing VTE recurrences without increasing the bleeding risk. According to International Guidelines, the long-term administration of LMWH should be considered an alternative to <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> drugs in patients with advanced disease and in those with conditions limiting the use of oral anticoagulants. The targeted policy is to administer LMWH at full therapeutic doses for the first month of treatment and then 75 % of the initial dose for at least the following 5 months of therapy. Prolongation of anticoagulation should be considered {{for as long as the}} malignant disorder is active. In patients with acute deep venous thrombosis and contraindications to anticoagulation, vena cava filters should be considered. If anticoagulation is temporarily contraindicated, retrievable filters should be considered. Only patients who are actively bleeding or who are at extremely high risk for bleeding should receive a filter without anticoagulation coverage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anticoagulation {{therapy with}} <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> (AVK; vitamin K antagonist) for the {{prevention}} of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is based on information derived from numerous well constructed, randomized controlled trials. Despite this conclusive evidence of efficacy, several studies have shown that 'real world' use of AVK in patients with AF is suboptimal. Our hypothesis was that geriatric characteristics (functional impairment, cognitive disorders, malnutrition, risk for falls, depression) could be an explanation for the underprescription of AVK in older patients with AF. Objective: To analyse the barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy, with special attention on geriatric characteristics. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 768 consecutive geriatric patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit of an academic hospital between April 2006 and November 2008. Data from comprehensive geriatric assessments were collected from computerized medical charts. Results: Analysis of data from the 768 medical charts showed that 111 patients (14 %) presented with AF. Among the 111 patients (72 % women), 45 %were living in an institution before admission. These patients presented a high prevalence of geriatric syndromes: cognitive disorders 59 %, malnutrition risk 59 %, incontinence 35 %, depression 37 %, and falls 61 %. Ninety percent of the patients had an Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) questionnaire score ≥ 2, which indicates an increased risk of frailty and functional decline during hospitalization. The prevalence of conditions measured by the CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]) clinical prediction scale was as follows: heart failure 19 %, hypertension 79 %, age > 75 years 95 %, diabetes 15 % and stroke 24 %. The mean -SD number of daily classes of drugs received at admission was 7. 1 ± 3. 3 (median 7, range 0 - 20). Forty-nine percent of patients had not received any AVK treatment before admission. The level of functional dependence for basic and instrumental activities of daily living did not differ between patients receiving AVK before admission and those not receiving AVK. Similarly, the proportion of geriatric problems (cognitive, malnutrition, depression and falls) did not differ between these two groups. To determine whether the decision to administer AVK therapy before admission was influenced by the risk of an embolic stroke, determined by the presence of CHADS 2 conditions, we compared the proportions of patients who fulfilled those conditions in each group: again, no difference was found. Conclusions: Almost half of the patients presenting with AF did not receive any AVK therapy before admission. In this population, in which most patients had multiple impairments, no single impairment or geriatric characteristic was identified as a barrier to AVK use. It is possible that combinations of impairments and geriatric characteristics were barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy across the whole of this population. More research is needed to identify and clarify the relative importance of patient-, physician-and healthcare system-related barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy in older patients with AF. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

40|$|A cute deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are different clinical presentations of the same underlying disease, namely venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a common and potentially fatal condition. Risk factors associated with the first and probably also subsequent events of VTE are hereditary or acquired. Regarding recurrent VTE the risk persists for many {{years after the first}} episode and is increased approximately 50 times compared with the risk of the first event in the general population. The traditional treatment of VTE has for decades been unfractionated. heparin (UFH) given intravenously (i. v.) or subcutaneously (s. c.). Low-molecular-mass hepatitis (LMMHs) have been developed and are characterized by the following pharmacokinetic benefits compared with UFH: higher bioavailability; longer half-life in plasma and an improved dose response after s. c. administration. The aims of our studies (Paper I-III) were to investigate the efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute DVT with a LMMH (dalteparin) administered s. c. once daily in the dose of 200 U per kg bodyweight compared with UFH i. v., and secondly, whether this new regimen could be utilized in an outpatient setting. We have demonstrated that the efficacy, assessed as changes of venograms between inclusion, after initial treatment and 6 months later, were similar in dalteparin (n= 101) and UFH (n= 103) treated patients (Paper I and III). The safety defined as frequency of bleeding events was also comparable. In a safety assessment and health economy outpatient study (Paper II) using this dalteparin regimen the combined frequency of major bleeding and recurrent VTE was 0. 92 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 25 - 2. 35 %), which is lower than in in-hospital trials. Deficiencies of the coagulation inhibitors antithrombin, protein C and protein S, as well as the mutations G 1691 ->A and G 20210 ->A in the coagulation factor V (FV) and prothrombin (FII) genes, respectively, are important risk factors for the first episode of VTE. Impaired fibrinolysis and the presence of antibodies against cardiolipin have also been associated with VTE. In a prospective open study (Paper IV) we intervened with recommendations of a changed lifestyle (low-fat diet, weight reduction, physical exercise, cessation of smoking) in patients with VTE and impaired fibrinolysis, defined as increased level of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) in plasma. In 65 % of 144 patients at least one of four life-style improvements was achieved and the more improvements the greater reduction in PAI- 1 levels. However, the frequency of recurrent VTE episodes during 6 years of follow-up did not correlate with these improvements. In an open randomized multicenter trial (DURAC- 1) 902 patients with objectively verified VTE received oral anti- vitamin K therapy for 6 weeks or for 6 months after the acute event. We followed 534 of these patients aged < 70 years at inclusion, for 48 months after their index event and obtained blood samples retrospectively for analyses of the G 1691 A and G 20210 A allele in the FV and FII genes, respectively (Paper V). The aim was to investigate the risk of recurrent VIE in carriers of these mutations. This risk in heterozygotes for the G 1691 A allele was not different from that in non-carriers (15. 4 % vs 13. 0 %). Homozygotes had an increased risk (p= 0. 036) of recurrent VTE. The risk of recurrent VTE for G 20210 A carriers was not different from that in non-carriers. However, this risk was significantly increased in patients with an idiopathic cause or a proximal extension of DVT or with PE at the index event, independent of the mutations discussed here. Of the patients in DURAC- 1 trial with a first episode of DVT initially (n= 790) 175 and 43 experienced recurrent DVT and PE, respectively (Paper VI). A recurrent thrombosis in the contra- and ipsilateral leg was diagnosed in 95 and 80 patients, respectively. No variable was associated with the side of recurrent event, except that ipsilateral DVT was significantly more frequent within 6 months only among those randomized to 6 weeks of oral <b>anti-vitamin</b> <b>K</b> therapy. In conclusion, the dalteparin regimen used in our studies is well tolerated and effective in defined patient categories in an outpatient setting and allows for substantial cost savings. Our studies emphasize the persistent and continuous risk of recurrent VTE in a long-term perspective for many patients. An increased risk of recurrent VTE has been documented in patients with an idiopathic cause, proximal DVT or PE at the index event and for homozygotes of the G 1691 A mutation. The risk of recurrent ipsi- and contralateral DVT was similar...|$|E
