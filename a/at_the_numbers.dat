25|$|St/V Herrmann was {{expanded}} to become Jagdgeschwader 300 (JG 300, or Fighter Wing 300), JG 301 and JG 302. All three units initially continued borrowing their aircraft from day fighter units. The day fighter units began to protest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of their aircraft which were being written {{off because of}} the hazards of night operations; the numbers soared {{with the onset of}} winter, with pilots often being forced to bail-out through being unable to find an airfield at which to land safely. Crash landings were also frequent. Eventually all three Wilde Sau units received their own aircraft, which were often modified with exhaust dampers and blind-flying radio equipment. Another unit was Nachtjagd Gruppe 10 (N/JGr 10), which used Fw 190 A-4/R11s through to A-8/R11s; Fw 190s modified to carry FuG (Funkgerät) 217 or FuG 218 radar mid-VHF band equipment.|$|E

Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: [...] "Many [...] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board... reduced to extremest misery and poverty." [...] Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, [...] "tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking one pennie for relief." ...|$|E

On offense, Vince Young had only 162yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, {{considered one of the}} nations best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy candidate coming into the game, was [...] "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". The Daily Texan predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> from what Reggie Bush did last week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|On 14 August 1914, {{soon after}} the First World War began, Elliott was given the same rank in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and command of the 7th Infantry Battalion, one of four Victorian battalions in Colonel James Whiteside McCay's 2nd Infantry Brigade. Elliott's first action was to ask Major Walter McNicoll to be his second in command, a {{position}} McNicoll readily accepted. He then supervised the raising of his battalion. Three of his eight companies were drawn from the northern suburbs of Melbourne, but the other five came mainly from central Victoria. He took particular care over the selection of officers. The newly formed battalion marched from Victoria Barracks to the training camp at Broadmeadows, Victoria, on 19 August. Elliott believed that Australians would take readily to military discipline if the reasons for it were properly explained. McCay was disturbed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of men without prior Militia training that were being enlisted, {{but some of the}} battalion's recruiting area had no Militia units. Instead, Elliott relied {{on the quality of the}} Militia's officers and non-commissioned officers to produce well-trained soldiers.|$|E
500|$|An {{early and}} very {{influential}} modern historian, George Grote, {{set the tone}} by expressing incredulity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> given by Herodotus: [...] "To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible." [...] Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but {{drew attention to the}} contradictions in the ancient sources. A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers [...] "wholly fabulous" [...] and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000. [...] A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water. Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.|$|E

2500|$|Rogers's {{last years}} {{were devoted to}} {{applying}} his theories in situations of political oppression and national social conflict, traveling worldwide to do so. [...] In Belfast, Northern Ireland, he brought together influential Protestants and Catholics; in South Africa, blacks and whites; in Brazil people emerging from dictatorship to democracy; in the United States, consumers and providers in the health field. His last trip, at age 85, was to the Soviet Union, where he lectured and facilitated intensive experiential workshops fostering communication and creativity. [...] He was astonished <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of Russians who knew of his work.|$|E
2500|$|Compulsory voting {{has also}} been {{promoted}} for its collective benefits. [...] It becomes difficult for coercion {{to be used to}} prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) as often happens under other voting systems. The compulsion requirement also needs to be kept in proportion: jury duty and compulsory military service are vastly more onerous citizen's compulsions [...] than attending a local voting booth once every few years. Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a system of compulsory voting is a simple matter of logistics, that is, to facilitate the smooth and orderly process of an election. Every year in countries that do not have compulsory voting election officials have to guess <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of voters who might turn out – this often depends on the vagaries of the weather. Often voters are disenfranchied in those countries when voting officials err and not enough voting booths are provided. Long queues can result with voters being turned away at the close of polling not having had their chance to exercise their democratic right to vote.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers.</b> Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E

And here this youth of mine, not yet with his spurs, though I dare say full five years older than you, must needs look sour upon it, because he has to sleep on a settle for one night--and that, too, when he has let Oliver de Clisson slip through his fingers, {{without so much as a}} scratch taken or given on either side!

60|$|But all the time, as {{he hurried}} {{along to the}} next corner, he looked fearfully {{to the right and}} left. Presently he began to steal guilty glances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of the houses. He said to himself that he would see what kind of a looking house they did live in, any way. It was only No. 900 odd when he began, and he could turn off if he wished long before he reached 1334. As he drew nearer he said he would just give a look at it, and then rush by. But 1334 was a house so much larger and nicer than he had {{expected}} that he stopped to collect his slow rustic thoughts, and decide whether she really lived there or whether she had just given that number for a blind. He did not know why he should think that, though; she was dressed well enough to come out of any house.|$|E
60|$|Now he has {{accompanied}} {{this account}} with another very curious one. For {{when you come}} to look into the particulars of it, you will find there are three bonds declared to be the Company's bonds, and which refer to the former transactions, namely, the money for which he had taken the bonds; but {{when you come to}} look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of them, you will find that one of the three bonds which he had taken as his own disappears, and another bond, of another date, and for a much larger sum, is substituted in its place, of which he had never mentioned anything whatever. So that, taking his first account, that two thirds is his own money, then that it is all his own, in the third that it is all the Company's money, by a fourth account, given in a paper describing the three bonds, you will find that there is one lac which he does not account for, but substitutes in its place a bond before taken as his own. He sinks and suppresses one bond, he gives two bonds to the Company, and to supply the want of the third, which he suppresses, he brings forward a bond for another sum, of another date, which he had never mentioned before. Here, then, you have four different accounts: if any one of them is true, every one of the other three is totally false. Such a system of cogging, such a system of fraud, such a system of prevarication, such a system of falsehood, never was, I believe, before exhibited in the world.|$|E
