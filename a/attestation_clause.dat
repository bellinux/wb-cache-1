It appears--I {{am taking}} Mr. Meeson's {{statement}} as being perfectly accurate--that the will was properly and duly {{executed by the}} testator, or rather by the person who tattooed in his presence and at his command: a form of signature which is very well covered by {{the section of the}} Act of 1. Vic., cap. 26. It seems, too, that the witnesses attested in the presence of each other and of the testator. It is true that there was no attestation clause: but the supposed necessity for an <b>attestation</b> <b>clause</b> is one of those fallacies of the lay mind which, perhaps, cluster more frequently and with a greater persistence round questions connected with testamentary disposition than those of any other branch of the law. Therefore, we must take the will to have been properly executed in accordance with the spirit of the statute.|$|E

Alan had given her a few pounds for {{housekeeping}} when they first got into the rooms, and those she kept; they were hers; she had not the slightest impulse to restore them to his family. All he left was hers too, by natural justice; and she knew it. He had drawn up his will, <b>attestation</b> <b>clause</b> and all, with even the very date inserted in pencil, the day before they quitted London together; but finding no friends at the club to witness it, he had put off executing it; and so had left Herminia entirely to her own resources. In the delirium of his fever, the subject never occurred to him. But no doubt existed as to the nature of his last wishes; and if Herminia herself had been placed in a similar position to that of the Merrick family, she would have scorned to take so mean an advantage of the mere legal omission.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, <b>attestation</b> <b>clauses</b> were {{introduced}} into probate law with the promulgation {{of the first}} version of the Model Probate Code in the 1940s. Statutes that authorize self-proved wills typically provide that a will that contains this language will be admitted to probate without affidavits from the attesting witnesses.|$|R

5000|$|The {{validity}} and {{form of an}} <b>attestation</b> <b>clause</b> is usually a matter of U.S. state law, and will {{vary from state to}} state. [...] Many states allow attestation clauses to be added as codicils to wills that were originally drafted without them.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in {{most common}} law jurisdictions, {{two or three}} {{witnesses}} must sign their names to the Will at the <b>attestation</b> <b>clause</b> below the testimonium clause that is executed by the testator. The exact number of witnesses depend on the state or local law. Under the English Statute of Wills of 1540, it was three witnesses. Under modern New York law, only two witnesses are required. [...] In Canadian law, a credible witness to a Will [...] "means a witness not incapacitated by mental inbecility (sic), interest or crime." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 8 October 1772, Phillis Wheatley, {{then about}} 18 years of age, {{was interviewed by}} 18 gentlemen {{identified}} publicly [...] "as the most respectable characters in Boston." [...] Among them were John Hancock, who {{served as president of}} the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,and would be remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, the Governor of Massachusetts Thomas Hutchinson, the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts Andrew Oliver and the Reverend Samuel Mather, son of Cotton Mather and grandson of Increase Mather. The men signed an <b>attestation</b> <b>clause</b> verifying that they believed Wheatley had written the poems herself, as claimed by her owner, John Wheatley. This clause was addressed To the Publick in Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral. What sort of questioning Wheatley was subjected to is unknown, for according to Henry Louis Gates [...] "no transcript of the exchanges that occurred between Miss Wheatley and her eighteen examiners" [...] exists today, but Wheatley appears to have [...] "passed inquiry with flying colors." ...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{academics}} {{and the public}} are fascinated by both constitutional text and the processes by which it is interpreted. The precise role for legal academics {{in the interpretation of}} such charters is controverted. Doctrine and case law as established by the courts remain the core of academic legal discourse. Case law is, after all, the object about which doctrine is based, built, and extended. But the interpretation of constitutional text through case law comes with costs [...] it seems to lack democratic legitimacy, and where unconnected to text and history, it has a tendency to fence out (even the well-educated) the public. On the other hand, when legal academics shift to text and history, their work gains populist credentials, but, at that point, the legal academic risks his privileged position. For the legal academic has no monopoly, or even highly developed expertise, with regard to textual exegesis or the best use of historical materials. In light of those attendant risks, I want to praise Professor Geoffrey R. Stone for taking on the role of exegete and historian. But that said, I find some of his specific textual and historical claims troubling. I respond to his textual and historical claims in detail below. This paper, however, has no grand normative claim of its own; it is merely an effort on my part to correct the record, and thereby to further the object pursued first by Professor Stone: “to know the truth about the Framers, about what they believed, and about what they aspired to when they created this nation. ” What follows is substantive discussion of the <b>Attestation</b> <b>Clause,</b> the Oaths and Affirmations Clause, the Sundays Excepted Clause, the Religious Test Clause, and a crtique of Stone's use of historical materials, particularly his claim in regard to a book burning at Harvard circa 1789. Professor Stone's article, to which I respond, can be found at: Geoffrey R. Stone, The World of the Framers: A Christian Nation?, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1 (2008). It is posted on the UCLA Law Review website. My Response appears in Penn State Law Review, and, in abridged form, it appeared in De Novo [...] the on-line supplement to Cardozo Law Review. This is the abridged version. De Novo plans to present my paper in conjunction with one or more replies...|$|E
