[...] Murdoch later said that [...] "circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn't lose money or anything like that", referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, {{and the fact that}} Stern returned all the money paid to it by the Sunday Times. In April 2012, during the Leveson Inquiry, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying [...] "It was a massive mistake I made <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to live with {{it for the rest of}} my life."

In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of Newsweek, to [...] "pursue new entrepreneurial ventures".|$|E
