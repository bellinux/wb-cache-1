5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{received}} more European settlers during its colonial era than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European {{immigrants in the}} United States.|$|E

25|$|A {{long period}} of {{political}} instability has resulted in depressed economic activity, deteriorating social conditions, and increased macroeconomic imbalances.

25|$|The {{opening of}} The Taichung Airport did spark a spat of {{partisan}} controversy about being incomplete and safety concerns were raised. The fact that Taiwan has more airports {{per capita than}} <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and prohibits private airplanes fell on deaf ears because the anticipated and protracted opening of direct links with the Chinese mainland are expected to require an increase in air traffic.|$|E

This is nearly twice as many sites as the next two countries, France (58) and Japan (55), combined. Construction of U.S. nuclear facilities peaked between the 1970s and 1980s, during which time, these facilities were granted 20–40 year operational permits.|$|E

25|$|Any type {{of sexual}} {{activity}} outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. Transsexuality in Iran is legal if accompanied by a gender confirmation surgery, with Iran carrying out more gender realignment operations than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world after Thailand. These surgeries are typically partially funded by the state – there have been claims that some homosexual men may have been pressured to undergo them both by government and society. Transsexuals still report societal intolerance as in other societies around the world.|$|E

25|$|In a 2000 {{review article}} of twentieth century Finnish architecture, Frédéric Edelmann, arts {{critic of the}} French {{newspaper}} Le Monde, suggested that Finland has more great architects {{of the status of}} Alvar Aalto in proportion to the population than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Finland's most significant architectural achievements are related to modern architecture, mostly because the current building stock has less than 20% that dates back to before 1955, which relates significantly to the reconstruction following World War II and the process of urbanisation which only gathered pace after the war.|$|E
25|$|A further {{financial}} burden was {{imposed on the}} new post-apartheid government through its obligation to provide antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to impoverished victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic sweeping the country. South Africa had the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS compared to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, with 5,600,000 people afflicted by the disease and 270,000 HIV-related deaths were recorded in 2011. By that time, more than 2,000,000 children were orphaned due to the epidemic. The provision of ARV treatment resulted in 100,000 fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Constitution {{guarantees}} free, {{universal health}} care for all its citizens. In practice, however, free health care is partially restricted because of mandatory registration. While Russia has more physicians, hospitals, and health care workers than almost <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world on a per capita basis, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union the health of the Russian population has declined considerably as a result of social, economic, and lifestyle changes; the trend has been reversed only in the recent years, with average life expectancy having increased 5.2 years for males and 3.1 years for females between 2006 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|The UAE {{spends more}} than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world to {{influence}} U.S. policy and shape domestic debate, and it pays former high-level government officials who worked with it {{to carry out its}} agenda within the U.S. The largest expatriate presence in the UAE is Indian. Following British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to a number of islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran. The UAE {{went so far as to}} bring the matter to the United Nations, but the case was dismissed. The dispute has not significantly impacted relations because of the large Iranian community presence and strong economic ties.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been criticized both by Iranians and {{international}} human right activists, writers, and NGOs. The United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission have condemned prior and ongoing abuses in Iran in published critiques and several resolutions. The government of Iran is criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republic's constitution and law, and for actions by state actors that do not, such as the torture, rape, and killing of political prisoners, and the beatings and killings of dissidents and other civilians. Iran executes more prisoners than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world with the exception of China, beating out its regional rival Saudi Arabia by nearly an order of magnitude.|$|E
30|$|On a side note, a {{reflection}} about Russian connection between immigration and growing nationalism is also pointed out. While emigration {{is on the}} rise, immigration is also increasing in {{a situation in which}} Russia has already received more immigrants than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> Europe. Immigration is one of the underlying causes for the growing nationalism in Russia.|$|R
