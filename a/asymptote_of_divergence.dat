40|$|Experimental {{observations}} are reported {{of the behavior}} of solutions between two rotating par-allel rollers where the form of the flow field between corotating rollers corresponds to that of a col which has nonorthogonal <b>asymptotes.</b> The obliquity <b>of</b> the <b>asymptotes</b> <b>of</b> the flow gives a di-rect measure of the relative magnitude of the constituent pure shear and rotational components of the flow field. Flow birefringence observations of polyethylene oxide solutions between the corotating rollers show that molecular orientation is limited to a highly localized region near the “outgoing ” as-ymptotic sheet of the flow field in accordance with the predictions of a “persistent extensional flow ” analysis presented. Counterrotating rollers show no flow birefringence also as expected.
