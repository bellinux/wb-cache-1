5|$|Cunningham {{had to wait}} a {{month for}} his next victory on 23 December 1940. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) sent 100 bombers led by Kampfgruppe 100 to attack Manchester. GCI {{vectored}} Cunningham onto the enemy aircraft. It was not yet dark and Cunningham identified the machine as a Heinkel He 111. Flying at 15,000 feet, he saw the Heinkel above the Beaufighter at 16,500 feet. Cunningham engaged the enemy 50 miles south of West Lulworth. The enemy climbed to 19,000 feet. Following, Cunningham opened fire at 200–300 yards. The He 111 was engulfed in fire. The bomber was high enough for the crew to jettison the bombs and incendiaries and glide to France where it crash-landed at Cherbourg. Two of Feldwebel Georg Deininger's crew were wounded. The 3./KGr 100 machine was written off. The crew were unaware they had been <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> night-fighter. They supposed they had been shot down by a flak ship.|$|E

5|$|In August 2014, it was {{announced}} that VyRT would exclusively broadcast worldwide the performance scheduled on September 15 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Sales for digital tickets began on September 3. VyRT provided access to several different experience packages featuring backstage interactivity with both bands and exclusive content. On September 15, before Thirty Seconds to Mars took to the stage, the VyRT platform was hacked and was <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> piracy. Jared Leto, founder of the streaming service, was forced to delay the performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars by an hour to resolve the issue. The audience eventually lost approximately three minutes of actual stage time, but the set list was shortened. The event included real-time social community engagement from audiences worldwide. A second broadcast of the show was later scheduled for September 17, 2014. The performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars became commercially available for download in October 2014 through VyRT. Footage recorded during the Carnivores Tour was uploaded to Linkin Park's official YouTube account.|$|E
