5|$|Given {{the lack}} of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will,</b> a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer {{during the week of}} January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the Florida Supreme Court in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E

An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Terri Schiavo case" [...] {{actually}} {{refers to}} a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was [...] "unclear" [...] whether the Schiavo case represents a landmark decision. The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, [...] "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan." [...] The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, Guardianship of Estelle Browning. In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the Florida Supreme Court that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed in <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water [...] "by a gastric tube or intravenously." [...] At that time it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had [...] "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'Donation after Cardiac Death' {{donors are}} {{patients}} {{who do not}} meet the brain-dead criteria but, due to the unlikely chance of recovery, have elected via <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> or through family to have support withdrawn. In this procedure, treatment is discontinued (mechanical ventilation is shut off). After a time of death has been pronounced, the patient is rushed to the operating room where the organs are recovered. Storage solution is flushed through the organs. Since the blood is no longer being circulated, coagulation must be prevented with large amounts of anti-coagulation agents such as heparin. [...] Several ethical and procedural guidelines must be followed; most importantly, the organ recovery team should not participate in the patient's care in any manner until after death has been declared.|$|E
2500|$|Palin's death panel {{remarks were}} based on the ideas of Betsy McCaughey. [...] During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against alleged rationing, {{referring}} to what by her interpretation was a [...] "downright evil" [...] "death panel" [...] in current reform legislation known as H.R. 3200 Section 1233. [...] However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and advance directives for patients in 2008. Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation H.R. 3200 would allow Medicare {{for the first time to}} cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> or planning hospice treatment. Patients could seek out such advice on their own, but would not be required to. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who sponsored the H.R. 3200 end of life counseling provision, said the measure would block funds for counseling that presents suicide or assisted suicide as an option, and called references to death panels or euthanasia [...] "mind-numbing". Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who co-sponsored a 2007 end-of-life counseling provision, called the euthanasia claim [...] "nuts". Analysts who examined the end-of-life provision Palin cited agree that Palin's claim is incorrect. According to TIME and ABC, Palin and Betsy McCaughey made false euthanasia claims.|$|E

5000|$|The {{state of}} Missouri and Nancy's {{guardian}} ad litem both appealed this decision. In a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the trial court's decision. It ruled {{that no one}} may refuse treatment for another person, absent <b>an</b> adequate <b>living</b> <b>will</b> [...] "or the clear and convincing, inherently reliable evidence absent here." [...] The Cruzans appealed, and in 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear the case.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Ends of Human Life Emanuel used the AIDS patient [...] "Andrew" [...] {{as an example}} of moral medical dilemmas. Andrew [...] talked to a local support group and signed <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will</b> asking that life {{sustaining}} procedures be withdrawn if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The will was not given to anyone but kept in his wallet, and no one was given power of attorney. [...] There were questions about his competence since he had AIDS dementia when he signed the will. Still, Andrew's lover said that he had talked about such situations, and asked that Andrew be allowed to die. Andrew's family strongly disagreed that Andrew wanted to die. Dr. Wolf previously saved Andrew's life, but promised to help him avoid a [...] "miserable death". [...] The ICU wanted guidance from Dr. Wolf as to how aggressively they should try to keep Andrew alive, as his chances of surviving a cardiac arrest were about zero. Two other critical patients were recently refused admission because of a bed shortage. There was a question as to whether Andrew's lover was representing Andrew's wishes or his own. There was also a question as to whether Andrewâ€™s parents knew Andrew better than others, or whether they were motivated by guilt from rejecting Andrew's identification as a gay male. The cost of aggressive treatment was $2,000 per day.|$|E

60|$|But why {{conceived}} as 'masculine or feminine'? This necessity for endowing inanimate though active things, such as rivers, with sex, {{is obviously a}} necessity of a stage of thought wholly unlike our own. We know that active inanimate things are sexless, are neuter; we feel no necessity to speak of them as male or female. How did the first speakers {{of the human race}} come to be obliged to call lifeless things by names connoting sex, and therefore connoting, not only activity, but also life and personality? We explain it by the theory that man called lifeless things male or female--by using gender-terminations--as a result of his habit of regarding lifeless things as personal beings; that habit, again, being the result of his consciousness of himself as <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E
