25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
25|$|At 12.50, just <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{emerged from}} a state of jubilation at finding the first {{definite}} fossils on Everest, {{there was a sudden}} clearing of the atmosphere, and the entire summit ridge and final peak of Everest were unveiled. My eyes became fixed on one tiny black spot silhouetted on a small snow-crest beneath a rock-step in the ridge; the black spot moved. Another black spot became apparent and moved up the snow to join the other on the crest. The first then approached the great rock-step and shortly emerged at the top; the second did likewise. Then the whole fascinating vision vanished, enveloped in cloud once more.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (<b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

25|$|I {{went to see}} {{the synagogue}} of the Jews at Aleppo, famed for {{fairness}} and antiquity. Their street is entered into by a narrow gate, which is so much lower than the rest, that it is descended to by a considerable number of steps. <b>After</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone through many of their narrow lanes, which they contrive so, purposely to hide the goodness of the building from the Turks, I came at length to the synagogue; which is a good large square uncovered court, with covered walks or cloysters round about, upheld by double pillars disposed according to good architecture. On the right hand of the entrance, is a kind of great hall, which they make use of for their service in the winter when it is cold or rains; as they do of the court in summer and fair weather: In the middle of the court four pillasters support a cupoletta, under which in a high and decent place, like our altar; lies the volume of the Law, and there also their doctor and principal rabbi stands reading in a kind of musical tone, to whom all the people alternately answer:...|$|E

My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round... to a temperate Nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthews' autobiography, The Way It Was, was {{released}} by Headline in 2000. The book is dedicated to his wife Mila, who died the year before its publication. Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, {{in the writing of}} the book over an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. [...] "Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser," [...] wrote Scott in the epilogue. [...] "Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book and, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left him, he would give the morning's session more applied thought — more often than not ringing me at home to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes." ...|$|E

500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there {{for five or six}} hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Moon's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after {{she saw the}} Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By {{the end of the}} year, she discovered she was pregnant; her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. They were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Registry Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: [...] "if we went out <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> Mandy," [...] she later said, [...] "if someone talked to me, he'd lose it. We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me." [...] He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. [...] "He {{had no idea how to}} be a father," [...] Kim said. [...] "He was too much of a child himself." ...|$|E

500|$|During World War II, Miller {{served as}} part of a bomber crew that participated in the {{destruction}} of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict in the 6thcentury. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story [...] "A Canticle for Leibowitz" [...] about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into [...] "Fiat Homo," [...] {{the first part of the}} novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F). Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in [...] "And the Light Is Risen," [...] which was published in August 1956 (also in F). That work would later grow into [...] "Fiat Lux." [...] It was while writing the third [...] "novelette," [...] "The Last Canticle," [...] for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: [...] "Only <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written the first two and was working on the third did it dawn on me that this isn't three novelettes, it's a novel. And I converted it." ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E
500|$|Lavender {{made his}} MLB debut on April23, 1912 as a relief pitcher in a 5–3 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates. On June28, versus the Pirates, he threw a one-hit shutout in a 3–0win, and {{collected}} three hits as a hitter. On July1, he shutout Pittsburgh once more, this time in a 12-inning, 1–0victory. He threw his third consecutive complete game shutout on July5, a 4–0victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Lavender took a 33-inning consecutive scoreless inning streak into his next start, a home game against the New York Giants and pitcher Rube Marquard. He gave up five hits and defeated the Giants 7–2, ending Marquard's consecutive win streak at 19games, {{which at the time}} tied the record for the longest streak in baseball history. The loss appeared to affect Marquard {{for the remainder of the}} season, though he regained his form in the 1912 World Series. During the 1913season, upon the ending of an 11-game winning streak by Washington Senators pitcher Joe Boehling, Marquard commented, [...] "I know just how Boehling feels. I know how I felt after Lavender beat me in Chicago last year <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> won nineteen straight, and I can sympathize with the Washington youngster." [...] Lavender would have continued success against the Giants throughout his career.|$|E
