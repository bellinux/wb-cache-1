40|$|To {{determine}} if an abnormality {{exists in the}} sympathetic nervous system of patients with <b>accelerated</b> hypertension, we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the tibial nerve by microneurography in eight benign essential hypertensives and seven <b>accelerated</b> essential hypertensives. Basal MSNA, plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly higher in <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives than in benign hypertensives (P < 0. 05). To clarify {{the relationship between the}} renin-angiotensin axis and sympathetic nervous system in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives, we measured the MSNA after 7 d of oral administration of captopril (75 mg/d) for antihypertensive treatment in the benign hypertensives and <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives. After administering captopril, the arterial pressure decreased significantly in the benign hypertensives and <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives with decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels, and the decreases in arterial pressure were greater in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensive than in the benign hypertensives. After captopril administration, the MSNA decreased significantly in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives but did not change in the benign hypertensives. Thus, in <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives, sympathetic tone is elevated, and the elevated sympathetic tone is closely related to the activated renin-angiotensin axis tone...|$|R
