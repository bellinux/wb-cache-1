5|$|After the Met and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway. Both the Met and the District {{wanted to see the}} line electrified, but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing power and the Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>from</b> both the SER's and the LB's New Cross stations to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch.|$|E

Limited by poor quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of the}} hills, and stopping at three intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains took between 35 and 45 minutes to travel from Wotton to Brill, and around <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>from</b> Wotton to the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road.|$|E

The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road.

Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E

25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent.

On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing {{over the edge of the}} precipice.|$|E
25|$|Cargo {{handling}} was reorganized in 1973, {{after which}} fewer stations handled cargo and more was transported the last kilometers by truck through Linjegods. Lumber became {{an increasingly important}} cargo from that decade, when the log floating was terminated. Throughout the 1970s and 1970s many stations became unmanned. NSB introduced their Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1984. Combined with the closing of many smaller halts, they allowed travel time between Hamar and Røros to be cut by <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>From</b> 1 June 1986 all local trains running between Hamar and Elverum were terminated. Class 86 remained in irregular service until 1996. In a deal to retain passenger traffic on the Solør Line, {{the day and night}} expresses to Oslo were run via Kongsvinger instead of Hamar, until 1989 for the day trains and 1991 for the night trains. General freight trains north of Koppang were terminated from 1995.|$|E
