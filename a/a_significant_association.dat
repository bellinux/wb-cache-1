5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} the Flemish {{biomonitoring}} programs, we describe the associations between internal exposure to organochlorine pollutants and to cadmium (measured in 2004 - 2005 for adults aged 50 - 65 years) and self-reported health status obtained through a questionnaire in November 2011. Dioxin-like activity in serum showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with risk of cancer for women. After adjustment for confounders and covariates, the odds ratio for an exposure equal to the 90 th percentile was 2. 4 times higher than for an exposure equal to the 10 th percentile. For {{both men and women}} dioxin-like activity and serum hexachlorobenzene (HCB) showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with risk of diabetes and of hypertension. Detailed analysis suggested that an increase in BMI might be part of the mechanism through which HCB contributes to diabetes and hypertension. Serum dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) concentration showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with diabetes and hypertension in men, but not in women. Serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 118 showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with diabetes in both men and women, and after adjustment for correlated exposures, also with hypertension in men. Urinary cadmium concentrations showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with hypertension. Urinary cadmium concentrations were (in 2004 - 2005) significantly higher in persons who felt in less than good health (in 2011) than in persons who felt in very good health. After adjustment for correlated exposures (to HCB, p,p'-DDE and PCB 118) marker PCBs showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>association</b> with diabetes and hypertension. Serum p,p'-DDE showed in men <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>association</b> with risk of diseases based on atheromata. Our findings suggest that exposure to pollutants can lead to an important increase in the risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension. Some pollutants may possibly also decrease the risk of some health problems, although this requires confirmation by other approaches. status: publishe...|$|R

The solvents, standards, execution of extraction procedures, and equipment used to carry out these analyses may differ among investigators and can introduce variation among studies. Hollman et al. investigated 18 laboratories that were asked to analyze water-soluble vitamin contents in selected foods. These authors reported that in contrast to the fat-soluble vitamins a wider range of methods was used for water-soluble vitamins and that results from different methods did not always agree for vitamins B2 and C.|$|E

40|$|Background. Risk factors {{underlying}} {{the development of}} Barrett 2 Ì 7 s esophagus (BE) are poorly understood. Recent {{studies have examined the}} association between elevated body mass index (BMI) and BE with conflicting results. A systematic review of literature was performed to study this association. ^ Methods. Cross-sectional, case control and cohort studies published through April 2007 meeting strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. A thorough data abstraction, including that of reported crude or adjusted odds ratios or mean BMI, was performed. Crude odds ratios were estimated from available information in 3 studies. ^ Results. Of 630 publications identified by our search items, 59 were reviewed in detail and 12 included in the final analyses. 3 studies showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> between obesity and BE (30 - 32) while 2 studies found <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> between overweight and BE (31, 32). Two studies that reported BMI as a continuous variable found BMI in cases to be significantly higher than that in the comparison group (30, 32). Other studies failed to show <b>an</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> between elevated BMI and BE. ^ Conclusions. There is conflicting data regarding the association between elevated BMI and BE. It is important to identify other risk factors that in combination with elevated BMI may lead to BE. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the presence of reflux symptoms or any particular pattern of obesity, are independently associated with BE. ^ Key words.
