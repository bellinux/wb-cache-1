5|$|Alsace {{in general}} is a stronghold of the French right. The main French right-wing party, The Republicans, {{currently}} holds <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> in the council (26 councillors). Marcel Bauer, who has been mayor since 2001, {{is also a member}} of that party. Voters in Sélestat generally favour right-wing candidates at other elections as well, although Sélestat was governed by the Socialist Party between 1989 and 2001.|$|E

50|$|Harold Wilson's Labour Party {{formed a}} {{government}} {{after winning a}} majority of four seats at the 1964 general election. Shortly after this by-election, Wilson called a general election for 31 March. Wilson's hope {{that he would be}} returned to office with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>majority</b> had been encouraged by the government's victory at the Hull North by-election. In the end, Wilson's decision was vindicated, as Labour was returned with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>majority</b> of 96 seats.|$|R

5|$|In 1820 Harrison {{ran against}} Jennings in his re{{election}} bid. Jennings {{won the election}} by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority,</b> 11,256 votes to Harrison's 2,008. Jennings's win by a three-to-one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state's voters were not overly concerned by attacks on the governor's character.|$|E

25|$|In other words, when Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method produce {{different}} {{orders of}} finish, for the majorities {{on which the}} two orders of finish disagree, the Schulze order reverses <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>majority</b> than the Ranked Pairs order.|$|R

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the emerging}} young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of {{one or a few}} years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the general}} {{elections}} of 2014, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the members of}} Texas's U.S. House delegation are Republican, along with both U.S. Senators.

5|$|During the {{elections}} of 1866, Heliade Rădulescu won {{a seat in the}} Chamber as a deputy for the city of Târgovişte. As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join Nicolae Ionescu and other disciples of Simion Bărnuţiu in opposing the appointment of Carol of Hohenzollern as Domnitor and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E

Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Perón did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Perón. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage {{and the organization of}} the Female Peronist Party granted Juan Perón <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> (sixty-three percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Following defeat on Honshū, Enomoto Takeaki fled to Hokkaidō {{with the}} {{remnants}} of the navy and his handful of French advisers. Together they organized a government, with the objective of establishing an independent island nation dedicated to the development of Hokkaidō. They formally established the Republic of Ezo on the American model, Japan's only ever republic, and Enomoto was elected as President, with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority.</b> The republic tried to reach out to foreign legations present in Hakodate, such as the Americans, French, and Russians, but was not able to garner any international recognition or support.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> of people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, {{was part of the}} eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under {{the scheme}} {{proposed}} by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1802, and in 1803 a law to implement escheat {{was passed by the}} legislature. However, the government of the United Kingdom would not abandon its principle of supporting property rights and refused to grant the bill Royal Assent.|$|E

One study in the Everglades showed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E
