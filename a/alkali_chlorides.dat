50|$|Chlorides are minor {{additional}} constituents {{contained in}} the raw materials and fuels of the clinker burning process.

This cycle in the area between the rotary kiln and the preheater can result in coating formation. A bypass at the kiln inlet allows effective reduction of alkali chloride cycles and to diminish coating build-up problems. During the clinker burning process, gaseous inorganic chlorine compounds are either not emitted at all or in very small quantities only.|$|E

It can also be recrystallized from a 20% solution of ammonium acetate. It is not hygroscopic and can explode when moist or under water; it was reported to remain explosive after 37 years under water. It explodes upon contact with concentrated sulfuric acid or chlorine or bromine, but not when contacting iodine. It is insoluble in nitric acid, but dissolves in ammonia, <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides,</b> alkali cyanides, aniline, pyridine, and potassium iodide by forming complexes. Concentrated hydrochloric acid decomposes it non-explosively with a hissing noise; thiosulfate also decomposes it non-explosively, and can be used for disposal.|$|E
50|$|Inbicon {{utilizes}} a hydrothermal pretreatment process {{after the}} mechanical conditioning of the feedstock. The premise {{of this process}} is to produce a fibre fraction and a liquid fraction through an extraction using hot water. In the fibre fraction this process achieves greater than 80% of the lignin present in the initial feedstock. Whereas the liquid fraction contains: C5 sugars, <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> and fermentation inhibitors. The main fermentation inhibitor present is acetic acid. However, the fermentation inhibitors can later be removed through detoxification with NH3 at a feasible cost. Since this pretreatment process does not use acids or bases and only water it eliminates the need to extract pretreatment chemicals once completed.During the initial step of the hydrothermal pretreatment process the feedstock is soaked and simultaneously placed in temperatures of up to 100 °C and ambient pressure. This allows for the extraction of air present and saturates the feedstock with water. The next step entails a pressurized treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of 170 to 230 °C through the addition of hot water or steam for approximately 5-15 minutes. This pressurized treatment can be repeated at altered temperatures and pressures in different zones increasing each subsequent time, therefore, labeled as a counter-current process. The steam released during the hydrothermal pre-treatment process is collected and reused in downstream evaporation processes. Throughout the hydrothermal pretreatment, there are acids formed that causes the fibre fraction to be nearly neutral in pH. The main benefit of this is that the pH will have to barely be adjusted for enzymatic liquefaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{problems}} during combustion of biomass is corrosion of superheaters, caused by the deposition of <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> containing ashes. <b>Alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> particles are formed during biomass combustion and transported via aerosols or in the vapour phase within the combustion gas, subsequently depositing on the metallic surface or on the already formed oxide layer. By reaction with the metal or the oxide layer the oxidation process is accelerated and metal is heavily consumed. To investigate these reactions several treatments, e. g. pre-oxidation, KCl deposition by thermophoresis and oxidation, were combined to produce various local deposits of KCl particles on iron samples. The deposit-carrying iron samples were exposed to N 2 - 20 vol. % O 2 and N 2 - 20 vol. % O 2 - 500 vppm HCl atmospheres for short times at 300 °C. In N 2 -O 2, deformation and local spreading of the particles was observed, probably by melt formation {{in contact with the}} metal.

40|$|Abstract- High {{levels of}} <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> in the flue gas can cause {{enhanced}} deposit formation and superheater corrosion during combustion of biofuels. These <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> mainly originate from potassium chloride (KCl). A challenge during combustion of biofuels is to simultaneously reduce NOx and KCl. The ChlorOut concept {{has been developed}} by Vattenfall to minimise deposit formation and corrosion. It consists of IACM, an instrument for on-line measurements of gaseous <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides,</b> and a sulphate-containing additive that converts <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> to less corrosive alkali sulphates. The sulphate-containing additive is often ammonium sulphate, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and, therefore, a significant NOx reduction is also achieved. This paper presents the results from {{a comparison of the}} conventional SNCR additives (ammonia or urea) and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 for reduction of NOx and/or KCl during combustion in a CFB boiler. The fuel consisted of either a mixture of wood chips and wood pellets with added PVC or with straw pellets. Of special interest was the influence of sulphation of KCl in parallel to the reduction of NO and if these processes interact. The results show that there are rather small differences in performance concerning NOx reduction between the additives...|$|E

The influence of material temperature (450 - 500 degrees C), flue gas temperature, temperature variations (i. e. thermal cycling) and additives to the fuel (elemental sulphur and dolomite) on deposition and corrosion was studied. The results presented here mainly consider the influence of sulphur additions to the fuel. The fuel was a mixture of 50 % household waste and 50 % industrial waste. After exposure the samples were analyzed by ESEM/EDX, XRD, AAS, FIB and IC. With no additional sulphur, <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> made up {{a large part of the}} deposit/corrosion product layer and in some cases chromate (VI) was detected. It is suggested that the chromate (VI) has formed by reaction of the protective oxide with <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> in the deposit. Adding sulphur to the fuel changed the composition of the deposits, <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> being largely replaced by alkali sulphates. No chromates(VI) were detected in the sulphur-added runs. It is suggested that adding sulphur to the fuel may decrease fireside corrosion because it changes the composition of the deposit.

40|$|In this thesis, {{computational}} {{methods have}} been developed for the simulation of aerosol dynamics and transport. Two different coupled aerosol-computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are discussed. One is a full Eulerian model and the other is a boundary layer-type streamtube model. The streamtube-based sectional model is able to provide an accurate solution of model equations within a reasonable computing time. For a number of studies, one-dimensional simulations are sufficient. Flow dependence can be taken from CFD simulations, flow correlations, or from experimentally-based estimates of time-temperature histories. While {{the focus is on the}} sectional method, a bivariate extension of the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) has also been tested. The method is shown to be able to provide reasonable computational representations of aerosol particle shape evolution. The models have been used to analyse various cases of aerosol formation, growth and deposition. Aerosol formation and growth dynamics simulations are used in analyses of aerosol formation experiments in a laminar flow reactor, experiments of particle property evolution in a counterflow diffusion flame reactor, and aerosol formation mechanisms in recovery boilers. Computational simulations of recovery boilers demonstrate the feasibility of Na 2 SO 4 -route fume formation mechanism theory. The accordance between particle size distribution predictions and experimental data is fairly good. Model studies of deposition provide insights into the transfer mechanisms of fly ash particles and inorganic vapours to the heat transfer surfaces of industrial boilers. Estimates of deposition velocities are obtained for particles of various sizes and inorganic vapours under various conditions. An area in which aerosol dynamics and transport processes are especially significant is the case of <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> deposition. For these species, there seems to be a great deal of variation in the proportions of particle and vapour deposition in the typical temperature range of biofuel fired boiler superheater conditions. In recovery boilers, particle deposition is predicted to be the dominant final <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> deposition mechanism for freshly soot-blown superheater surfaces, while direct vapour deposition can be equally important when there is an insulating deposit layer, and, consequently, higher temperatures at the deposit surface. The total rate of <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> deposition does not have as strong a temperature dependence. While homogeneous nucleation is predicted to be negligible in recovery boiler superheater tube boundary layers, the reverse is true for conditions resembling fluidised beds during bio- and mixed fuel combustion. The relationship between deposit-related problems, such as fouling, slagging and corrosion, and the rate of deposition is not necessarily straightforward. Initial steps have been taken to simulate deposit transformations in order to provide computational demonstrations of the implications of <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> deposition. A model that links <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> deposition to the presence of HCl in the deposit-metal interface has been developed and illustrative simulations have been carried out. Overall, the models are shown to provide an insight into aerosol dynamics and transport phenomena in various systems. It is noted that the development of a universal CFD-based aerosol model is difficult. Instead, it is often more appropriate to make suitable simplifying assumptions, such as a parabolic flow, a constant size distribution shape or a reduction to one dimension. Suitable assumptions allow the use of computationally efficient and accurate methods. These make it possible to extend the scope of modelling beyond aerosol issues, for a more extensive analysis. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a more {{sustainable}} society renewable fuels such as biomass and waste are attractive alternatives to fossil fuels for power production. However, fireside corrosion is a serious concern in boilers combusting biomass or waste. The high corrosion rates are often linked to large amounts of <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> in the flue gas. One way of mitigating the corrosion {{is to change the}} corrosive environment in the boiler, e. g. by increasing the availability of SOx(g) in order to sulphate the <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> to less corrosive alkali sulphates. However, the reaction releases the corrosive gas HCl and the presence of high concentrations of SO 2 is often associated with increased corrosion rates. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the interplay between different corrosion mechanisms by connecting the reaction kinetics to the corrosion attacks. The results showed that the presence of KCl accelerated the corrosion of the stainless steel 304 L by two types of corrosion attack: general corrosion and steel grain boundary attack. The general corrosion has been proved to be initiated by chromate formation while the steel grain boundary attack is suggested to be accelerated by HCl, released from the chromate formation reaction. Increasing the availability of SOx(g) in the flue gas was shown to decrease the corrosion rate. If the <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> were sulphated in the flue gas a non-corrosive deposit was formed on the steel and the corrosion attack was negligible. However, during a simultaneous presence of SOx(g) and <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides</b> (e. g. KCl(s)) on the steel surface, competing reactions such as sulphation of the alkali chloride and chromate formation occurred. The chromate formation resulted in a general corrosion attack. However, the oxide growth was significantly reduced due to the fast simultaneous sulphation of the <b>alkali</b> <b>chlorides.</b> In contrast, the steel grain boundary attack increased in the presence of SO 2. It is proposed that this attack is accelerated by HCl released from the sulphation reaction as well as metal sulphides formation in the steel grain boundaries...|$|E

The reactive oxyanionic OCl– species acting as active sites are catalytically formed by oxidation of Cl– at the MgO surface. Under reaction conditions this site is regenerated by O 2, dissolving {{first in the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>chloride</b> melt, {{and in the second}} step dissociating and replenishing the oxygen vacancies on MgO. The oxyanion reactively dehydrogenates ethane at the melt–gas phase interface with nearly ideal selectivity. Thus, the reaction is concluded to proceed via two coupled steps following a Mars-van-Krevelen-mechanism at the solid–liquid and gas–liquid interface. The dissociation of O 2 and/or the oxidation of Cl– at the melt–solid interface is concluded to have the lowest forward rate constants. The compositions of the oxide core and the molten chloride shell control the catalytic activity via the redox potential of the metal oxide and of the OCl–. Traces of water may be present in the molten chloride under reaction conditions, but the specific impact of this water is not obvious at present. The spatial separation of oxygen and ethane activation sites and the dynamic rearrangement of the surface anions and cations, preventing the exposure of coordinatively unsaturated cations, are concluded to be the origin of the surprisingly high olefin selectivity...|$|R
