The crime of rape or unlawful sexual connection requires that the accused {{did not have the}} person’s consent and did not believe on reasonable grounds that the person was consenting. [...] A 2008 discussion document issued by the Ministry of Justice called for submissions on the inclusion of ‘positive consent’, the inclusion of broader investigation into the surrounding circumstances in determining whether the accused had reasonable grounds for consent, and the extension of the ‘rape shield’ to limit a defendant's ability to question a complainant about their past sexual behaviour. Furthermore, the question was raised over the models and practices of the current justice system in dealing with sexual violence. In 2009 the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence produced a report including recommendations on preventing sexual violence, creating specialist front-line services for victims and offenders, reforming criminal justice, and approaches to end sexual violence. [...] The report recommended the completion of a Sexual Violence Prevention Plan, a review of funding for crisis support services, legislative changes to the Accident Compensation Corporation scheme, legislative amendments to the Crimes Act 1961, and an exploration of <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> in cases of sexual offences. The New Zealand government responded to the report in September 2010, however it was noted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2012 that many of the recommendations in the report have yet to be implemented.|$|E

Indeed, international criminal law is often presented as the road towards global justice. But the rise of international criminal law and its equation with global justice come with a profound risk: <b>alternative</b> conceptions of <b>justice</b> can be marginalized. Based on field work in Uganda and Sudan, we present five examples of <b>alternative</b> conceptions of <b>justice</b> that in fact have been side-lined: the restoration of relationships, putting an end to on-going violence, redistribution, non-criminal law forms of punishment and equality.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, drug courts have been {{introduced}} throughout Australia, {{to address the issue}} of drug related crime. Drug courts aim to reduce criminal recidivism by placing drug dependent offenders into intensive supervision and treatment programs. Research has revealed that drug courts, including the Perth Drug Court, can reduce criminal recidivism in offenders for whom drug use is a dynamic risk factor for their criminal behaviour. Currently however, little is known about the public’s knowledge and perceptions of drug courts. The aim of the current study was to determine the perceptions of a sample of the Western Australian public, in relation to the Perth Drug Court as a way of dealing with drug related crime. The current study was exploratory and qualitative, and involved an inductive thematic analysis of secondary data collected as part of an undergraduate research unit at Edith Cowan University. A semi-structured interview approach was applied to explore participants’ (n= 33) perceptions about drug use, crime and the Perth Drug Court in-depth. During the interview participants were provided with some brief, contextual information regarding the Perth Drug Court, in order to place their perceptions in a more accurate context. The findings revealed that members of the public have punitive attitudes towards drug dependent offenders and lack knowledge about <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> strategies such as the Perth Drug Court. However, despite this, many participants felt that the Perth Drug Court would be effective in reducing drug related criminal recidivism, thus showing some support for the concept. The findings of the current study provide an understanding of how a sample of the Western Australian public view the Perth Drug Court, which can inform further research regarding public perceptions of drug courts, and other <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> strategies...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades in {{countries}} like Australia, the response to crime is moving in two directions. One tack is innovative: it promises to change established forms of criminal justice, to do justice differently. The other tack is repetitive: it promises to intensify established forms of criminal justice, to do justice more efficiently, and often more punitively. Crime control and justice policies have always been varied, but as O ’Malley says (1999 : 176), there now exists an unprecedented “state of penological inconsistency 2 ̆ 2. <b>Alternative</b> <b>justice</b> forms, such as meetings between victims and offenders, or magistrates who take an active interest in helping defendants, sit alongside mandatory sentences for certain repeat offenders.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{violence}} in Indigenous communi-ties is violence between intimate partners. Indigenous sentencing courts and specialist family violence courts (as well as mainstream courts) are used in Australia to sentence Indigenous partner violence offenders. Currently, there are over 50 Indigenous sentencing courts operating in all Australian states and territories, except Tasmania, which use Indigenous Elders to assist a judicial officer in sentencing an offender. Debates exist surrounding the issue of whether <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> forums are appropriate in cases involving domestic and family violence. Feminist advocates are concerned with the appearance of a ‘too lenient ’ response to violent men and the danger of exposing a victim to further power imbalances during a hearing, whereas Indigenous advocates focus on the need for justice practices that are more culturally relevant, sensitive and appropriate. This article explores the extent to which gendered power imbalances are present in Australian Indigenous sentencing court hearings concerning intimate partner violence offending, and how, if at all, such power imbalances are managed by a process which aims to be more culturally appropriate...|$|E

40|$|After {{setting the}} {{political}} and personal contexts, defining key terms, and comparing Indigenous and restorative justice, I clarify three interrelated sites of contestation between and among feminist and anti-racist groups as these relate to <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> practices.

I outline an intersectional politics of justice, which seeks to address the conflicts at each site.

It proposes that victims and offenders have positive rights that are not compromised by collectivities. 1 Since 1978, as a student and academic, I have been interested in the relationship of inequalities to crime and justice, and in alternative ways of doing justice.

In the end, Paik argues that determinations of success or compliance based on a concept of individual accountability actually veil differential legal treatment based on race, class and gender...|$|E

Since Jack the Ripper, the serial killer has been the monster at the heart of modernity, the irrational urge law and society has sought to control and understand. And yet the popular cultural trend (from the 00 s on) has been towards the representation of sympathetic, almost seductive, serial killers in media texts like Hannibal (2001), Dexter (2006 - 2013) and Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata's 2003 manga Death Note. This paper analyses how these millennial serial killers are often offered up as <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> figures, operating outside the constraints of law or morality, to punish those criminals who escape or otherwise operate beyond the reach of the legal system, with Dexter and Death Note's Light representing the end point of these killers, those who offer an entirely new system of justice ('a new world') predicated on their ability to kill those they consider deserving of death.

The Minimum Standards focus on optimal diversion outcomes for children in conflict with the law and were designed to ensure good diversion practice. The juvenile justice system has determined child diversion as a rehabilitative and cost-effective <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> option, positively contributing towards the curbing of re-offending among child offenders. The research process was guided by a mixed method approach and utilised a structured questionnaire as well as comments and information stated by the respondents during the interview process.

The results of the study revealed a high level of Minimum Programme Outcomes Standards compliance, with an average of 83 %. These results indicate that, in general, the programmes provided by non-governmental diversion service providers are complying with the Minimum Standards and are thereby ensuring good diversion practice.

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of a Zero Tolerance Policy in Indonesia, several {{policies}} to address domestic violence have been enacted. The obligation of local governments to establish service units for women survivors of domestic violence is one of them. Since domestic violence is a sensitive and complex issue in Indonesia {{it is important to}} understand how governmentally regulated services function in practice. This case study aimed to explore challenges faced by a local service agency in managing service provision for women survivors of domestic violence in rural Indonesia. Data from one focus group discussion (12 participants), four individual interviews, six short narratives, two days of participant observation, as well as archive reviews were collected. All data were analyzed using Grounded Theory Situational Analysis. The major challenge faced by the local agency was the low priority that was given them by the local authorities, mirrored also in low involvement by the assigned volunteers in the daily service. The study also identified a gap between the socio-cultural arena and the law &amp; policy arena that needs to be bridged to avoid that the two arenas address domestic violence in a contradictory way. Budget allocation to support the sustainability of the daily routines of service agencies has to be given priority. There is also a need for careful considerations regarding the composition of personnel involved within daily management of service agencies addressing domestic violence. To bridge the gap between the legal systems and traditional cultural values, culturally adjusted <b>alternative</b> <b>justice</b> systems could be developed to increase women's access to legal support.
