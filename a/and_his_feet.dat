25|$|Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, {{commented that}} “it was amazing that Tommy Greenhough played Test cricket at all. As a young player with Lancashire, {{he took a}} job in a cotton mill during the winter and fell from a gantry. Both ankles were badly broken <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> ended up {{different}} sizes”. Bateman went on “he overcame his handicap {{to become one of the}} most inventive leg-break bowlers in the country, performing well when called up in 1959. He could, however, lose confidence, as happened on the 1960 tour of the West Indies, where he did not play a Test”.|$|E
25|$|The king is {{depicted}} standing upright, three quarters to the left, his head low <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in view, a pose calculated to presenting {{the greater part}} of his person. The king occupies the central space of the painting whose composition is constructed from vertical lines (column, king, throne) and a pyramid in which the sovereign inscribes, which creates an elevated space. The drama of the scene is accentuated by a heavy draped curtain which traditionally means that the king does not appear but appears. A large marble pillar, traditional evocation of power since the Renaissance (as a stability symbol, the world axis that unites the earthly and heavenly powers) holds the composition left. The massive barrel rests on a stylobate whose two visible sides are decorated with reliefs depicting two royal virtues: The allegories of Justice (front) and strength (left, very difficult to see).|$|E

25|$|On 1 December 1948 at 6:30am, {{the police}} were {{contacted}} after {{the body of a}} man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. He was lying back with his head resting against the seawall, with his legs extended <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven Kensitas cigarettes, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.|$|E

500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs.

He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin.

500|$|Silver's final {{recordings}} {{with the}} Jazz Messengers were in May 1956. Later that year, he left Blakey after {{one and a}} half years, {{in part because of the}} heroin use prevalent in the band, which Silver did not want to be involved in. Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material they played, and, in concert, he [...] "won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. He crouched over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> pounding." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. He is wearing a suit <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|Fingleton wrote, [...] "He {{crouched}} {{a little}} at the crease...he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> were so eager {{to be on the}} move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled. This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. I never saw a better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position." [...] However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said [...] "There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal ?" [...] Robinson described Ponsford as the [...] "founder of total batting, the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph." [...] The New South Wales and Australian bowler Arthur Mailey later said that [...] "I don't think it was the rungetting Ponny enjoyed so much as the bowlers' discomfort, especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales." ...|$|E

500|$|St Francis lived austerely, in {{imitation}} of Christ. He embraced the natural world, and took vows of poverty, charity and chastity. In 1224 at La Verna, he experienced the mystical vision which van Eyck portrays. Thomas of Celano, author of Francis's hagiography, describes the vision and stigmatization: [...] "Francis had a vision in which he saw a man like a seraph: he had six wings and was standing above him with his hands outstretched <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> bound together, and was fixed to a cross. Two wings were lifted above his head, and two were spread ready for flight, and two covered his whole body. When Francis saw this he was utterly amazed. He could not fathom what this vision might mean." [...] As he meditated, [...] "marks of nails began to appear {{on his hands and}} feet... His hands and feet seemed to be pierced by nails appearing on the inside of his hands and the upper side of his feet... His right side was scarred {{as if it had been}} pierced by a spear, and it often seeped blood." [...] To the medieval observer, the appearance of the stigmata signifies Francis's complete absorption in the vision of the seraph.|$|E
500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E
500|$|To {{the rear}} and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez(8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, {{and head of the}} royal {{tapestry}} works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is [...] "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the open doorway reveal space behind: {{in the words of the}} art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure [...] "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is [...] "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".|$|E

500|$|Changeling {{sits with}} other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and {{the search for}} family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental {{struggle}} to communicate with children. It {{can also be seen}} as a variation of the Eastwood [...] "revenge movie" [...] ethic; in this case, the [...] "avenging grunt" [...] transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World(1993) and Mystic River(2003). Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River, which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was [...] "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible. Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, [...] "When [...] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be." [...] Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was [...] "unbearable" [...] due to its attention to detail; he believed {{it one of the most}} convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Lyon's {{success at}} stud was {{hampered}} by chronic foot and leg ailments that stemmed from poor limb conformation. The Earl of Suffolk remarked on Lord Lyon's condition in 1884, [...] "he was in most respects as perfect a model as one could wish to see, but {{below the knee}} he dwindled away to nothing; his ankles were small and bullety, his pasterns straight, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> half the size they should have been." [...] In the early 1880s, Lord Lyon's connections decided to euthanize him, but his life was spared due {{to the efforts of}} John Winteringham. Winteringham relocated Lord Lyon to the Croft Stud at Croft-on-Tees around 1881. After the success of Minting, he was advertised in 1885 as a breeding stallion for Winteringham, covering a limited number of mares per season for a fee of 21 guineas per mare. Lord Lyon remained in Yorkshire until he was euthanized at the age of 24 on 12 April 1887.|$|E
