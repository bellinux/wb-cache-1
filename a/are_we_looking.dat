40|$|Sexual harm is a {{high profile}} issue, both nationally and internationally, {{with the number of}} {{perpetrators}} entering and being managed by the Criminal Justice System continually increasing. These increases in the sexual offender population are the result of a “perfect storm” of disclosures, reporting, recording, sentencing and community management. The ever increasing sex offender population places additional pressure on existing risk management services (i. e., Police, Probation, Prison, etc.) already under financial, political and practical strain.. Such strain ultimately means that sex offender risk management becomes about bureaucracy, cost saving, risk aversion and an audit culture rather than innovation and adaption.

40|$|A video {{recorded}} after {{a session}} at the FAP Symposium on Feed in Smallholder Systems Luang Prabang, Laos, 18 - 19 November 2010. After a session of the the November 2010 Fodder Adoption Project (FAP) workshop in Laos, we recorded 'notes' of three world cafe hosts who collated cross-project lessons (from Ethiopia, Syria, and Vietnam) on three issues: Innovation approaches, feed assessment, and scaling out. Here Michael Blümmel of ILRI, reports back on the discussions about feed assessment in the project. He emphasized that feed is a key issue in determining livestock productivity and the overall economics of livestock system; it also concerns how much we are affecting the environment through, for example, greenhouse gas emissions. So feed is very much at the interface of {{the positive and negative}} effects of livestock. A key message from the workshop discussions {{is that we need to}} look at feed resources in a much wider context, in relation to systems, in relation to markets and in relation to improving value chains. He considers this a promising outcome as previously people focused on more limited technical entry points. Some other key issues: - The need to better understand feed gaps and demand. <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>looking</b> to satisfy current needs, subsistence needs, or <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>looking</b> forward to the so called livestock revolution where farmers have to produce more, with fewer animals, for fast growing markets for animal products - Better defining what we mean by a feed gap? Is it defined in terms of how a farmer can produce more, or at a country level? - Are we focusing too much on the positive side of feeds [...] . and neglecting trade-off effects [...] . land, water. We need to do much more in terms of balancing positive and negative effects. In conclusion, the group seems to agree that we should focus on livestock systems in 'transition' - trying to move people out of poverty (by increasing their productivity, increasing their production for markets) and believing that once they move out of agriculture, we are essentially looking at new livestock systems in the future...|$|E

40|$|Colin B Seymour, Carmel MothersillMedical Physics and Applied Radiation Sciences Department, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, CanadaAbstract: This {{discussion}} paper seeks to provoke thoughts about cancer research in general, and why {{breast cancer in}} particular is not yet “curable”. It asks the question – <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>looking</b> at the disease in the right way? Should we regard cancer as a progressive state, {{which is part of}} aging? Should we tailor treatment to “reset” the system or slow progression rather than try using toxic and aggressive therapy to kill every cancer cell (and sometimes also the patient) ? The thesis is presented that we need to revisit our fundamental beliefs about the disease and then ask why we cling to beliefs that clearly are no longer valid. The paper also questions the role of ethics boards in hampering research and discusses the concept that breast cancer is an industry with vested interests involving profiteering by preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic players. Finally, the paper suggests some ways forward based on emerging concepts in system biology and epigenetics. Keywords: breast cancer, causes, treatment, questioning paradigm...|$|E

After a discussion on signposting for people with impaired vision, this section of the book ends with a chapter on planning.

Social network analysis should facilitate understanding of variables governing where and when members enter each network, how, when, and where a network expands and contracts, how relationships alter dynamically within a network, how multiple networks might share members, which network has the strongest claim to member loyalty at any given time, and how networks start and end.

The goal of the project is to design a cinema centre that is original and offers the user a new and exciting experience. The cinema is based on the film and information technology industry especially new and future technological trends. The main focus, however, is the user's experience through the space and how it can be enhanced through the use of technology.
