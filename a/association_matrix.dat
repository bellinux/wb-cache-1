To incremental type of transaction matrix, it can also make the maintainment of association rule more convenient in the use of partitioning calculation technique of matrix. On the other and, aiming at the demerits in FP-growth algorithm, this paper proposes a FP-network model which compresses the data needed in association rule mining in a FP-network.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth in {{wireless}} local area networks (WLANs), it has become important to characterize the fine-grained structure of user association patterns. In this paper, we focus on unraveling the structure in user’s daily association patterns in WLANs in the long run. The daily access pattern {{is defined by the}} fraction of time it spends with a particular location. We answer three questions: 1) Do users demonstrate consistent behavior? Using our novel metrics and clustering, we conclude that many users (more than 50 %) are multimodal. 2) Is it possible to represent user association patterns using a compact representation? Using eigendecomposition, we show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the constructed user <b>association</b> <b>matrices</b> is low and only the top five eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors can be used to reconstruct those <b>association</b> <b>matrices</b> with an error of 5 %, in terms of the L 1 and L 2 matrix norms. 3) How can we decide if two users have similar association patterns? We define two new metrics, and we rigorously validate their efficacy by demonstrating that the inter and intra cluster distributions, upon clustering, have very little overlap. Our methods and observations are a first step towards systematically mining user-association patterns and could lead to new directions in network management and understanding social patterns of users. ...|$|R

40|$|Building an {{architecture}} for human cognition {{is a complex}} task requiring the incorporation of multiple mechanisms in a smoothly functioning system. There are two major cognitive architectural approaches to processing. Both approaches are well represented by other contributors to this volume. The symbolic process-ing approach (e. g., SOAR, Laird, Newell, & Rosenbloom, 1987; ACT*, Ander-son, 1983) represents processing as the manipulation of symbols via rules or productions. Connectionist processing involves the association of input and out-put patterns via <b>association</b> <b>matrices</b> (see Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; Schneider, 1987). These two approaches are often viewed as competing alter-natives for cognitive processing (see Smolensky, 1988). Our research treats these two approaches as complementary. We believe that human cognition involves connectionist-like, associative best-match processing combined with an attentional system that allows rule-like processing.

40|$|Human brain {{functional}} {{system has}} been viewed as a complex network. To accurately characterize this brain network, {{it is important to}} estimate the functional connectivity between separate brain regions (i. e. <b>association</b> <b>matrix).</b> One common approach to evaluating the connectivity is the pairwise Pearson correlation. However, this bivariate method completely ignores the influence of other regions when computing the pairwise association. Another intractable issue existed in many approaches to further analyzing the network structure is the requirement of applying a threshold to the <b>association</b> <b>matrix.</b> To address these issues, we develop a novel scheme to investigate the brain functional networks. Specifically, we first establish a global functional connection network by using Adaptive Sparse Representation (ASR), adaptively integrating the sparsity of l 1 -norm and the grouping effect of l 2 -norm for linear representation and then identify connectivity patterns with Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering algorithm. Results on both simulated and real data indicate that the proposed scheme is superior to the Pearson correlation in connectivity quality and clustering quality.

Weighted network statistics are calculated and can be tested against null hypotheses. Temporal analyses include displays of lagged association rates (rates of reassociation following an association). Models can be fitted to lagged association rates. Multiple association measures, including measures produced by other programs such as genetic or range use data, may be analysed using Mantel tests and principal components analysis.
