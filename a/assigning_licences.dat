50|$|In January 2009 the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in China {{took the}} unusual step of <b>assigning</b> <b>licences</b> for 3 {{different}} third-generation mobile phone standards to three carriers in a long-awaited step {{that is expected}} to prompt $41 billion in spending on new equipment. The Chinese-developed standard, TD-SCDMA, was assigned to China Mobile, the world's biggest phone carrier by subscribers. That appeared to be an effort to make sure the new system has the financial and technical backing to succeed. Licences for two existing 3G standards, W-CDMA and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, were assigned to China Unicom and China Telecom, respectively. Third-generation, or 3G, technology supports Web surfing, wireless video and other services and the start of service is expected to spur new revenue growth.|$|E
40|$|Economic theory, as well {{as various}} countries' experiences, show that {{auctioning}} the spectrum works better than other allocation methods, such as beauty contests. As well as raising revenues, a well-designed auction <b>assigns</b> <b>licences</b> to the operators best able to use them. Auctions can also be designed to advance public-policy goals. In this paper, we discuss some common misunderstandings about auctions. We also consider the need for asymmetric regulations {{for the next generation}} of mobile services in terms of bandwidth, roaming and coverage constraints...|$|R

5000|$|The image hosting {{and video}} hosting website Flickr {{is a popular}} source of files for Wikimedia Commons. Its users upload content they create to Flickr's servers, <b>assigning</b> a <b>licence</b> for each work or {{accepting}} a default copyright licence. It was found that some Flickr users upload content that is not their own creation, and for which they have no authority or licence grant to do so. Some of these works are erroneously <b>assigned</b> a free <b>licence,</b> apparently permitting their unrestricted distribution, including uploading the content to Wikimedia Commons. The practice {{has come to be}} known as [...] "Flickr washing" [...] on Wikimedia Commons, as it is the most common site from which licence laundered files are uploaded.|$|R
50|$|There {{are eight}} large taxi licence holders, those which own and control more than 10 licences. The largest licence holders are Cabcharge Australia Ltd, which also {{operates}} the 13CABS network, and the Gange Corporation, which operates the Silver Top Taxis network. More than 60% of <b>licences</b> are <b>assigned</b> (or leased or rented) to taxi operators, who pay the licence holder assignment fees. These can fluctuate, and typically {{are in the}} order of $24,000 per annum. The operator owns, maintains and operates the taxi vehicle as well as the taximeter. Taxi operators may drive their taxis or may employ drivers. In June 2016 there were 14,771 active taxi drivers. Taxi drivers are required to be registered, and their registration certificate must be displayed in the taxi. A taxi operator can sell the taxi, comprising the <b>assigned</b> <b>licence,</b> vehicle and meter, as a going concern. Besides receiving the assignment fees from the taxi operator, licence holders also commonly benefit from capital growth in licence values, or carry the risk of a decline in the market value of a licence.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the FCC <b>assigns</b> radio <b>licences</b> {{after making}} a {{determination}} of the public interest. Conflicting licence applications are resolved through comparative hearings. This mechanism is cumbersome and unreliable. This article analyses three alternatives: Increasing the available spectrum; an auction; or, lottery of radio licences. The analysis deals specifically with the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS). The analysis suggests that increasing the spectrum allocation will create more assignments than will be demanded by MDS. Rough calculations suggest that auctions offer a more efficient selection mechanism. Lotteries with resale of the license are better than hearings, but {{not as good as}} auctions.

50|$|Some {{experimentation}} {{is already}} being conducted in a few countries. In Kenya, the Digital Village Scheme project aims at providing government services in rural areas via wireless access. In Nigeria, Horizon Wireless is running a broadband (3.5 GHz) wireless network. Since 2007, MTN Rwanda has been working to provide broadband wireless access in Kigali. In Algeria, the Icosnet ISP and Aperto Networks have been collaborating for a business WiMAX solution. The South African authority ICASA has already <b>assigned</b> WiMAX <b>licences</b> to several providers, and Neotel is implementing WiMAX-based last mile solutions in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{undertakes}} {{a comparative}} review of radical {{innovation in the}} early Cold War, when UK jet propulsion development far outpaced any US efforts. British ingenuity created a series of jet engines which Americans adopted. One among these, which captures contrasting organisational formats for handling complexity and innovation, was the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, a tough, reliable propulsion system. The USAF's <b>licence</b> <b>assigned</b> production to Curtiss-Wright, which had made piston engines for decades and which spectacularly botched the project, wasting millions. Eventually, the Pentagon shifted the J- 65 American Sapphire to GM's Buick division, which finally fabricated adequate but obsolete engines in the mid- 1950 s. innovation, technology transfer, military, contracting, Cold War, jet engines,...|$|R
30|$|The taxi {{licensing}} system in Norway {{is based on}} the owner-operator as the main unit, and in areas viable economically, owner-operators can be affiliated to a dispatching company. Affiliation is compulsory in urban areas. An operating licence is required, with each owner a qualified driver and each vehicle a separate licence. In principal, one licence per owner, but a licence for a backup vehicle is common. If there are no new applicants for a licence, someone who is already a licence-holder can be <b>assigned</b> more <b>licences.</b> The total number of licences is determined {{in a variety of ways}} by different local authorities and county governments are responsible for regulation. The law 3 requires local government to restrict the number of licences through needs assessment, but does not state how this is to be done. How and the extent to which this form of entry regulation is a barrier to entry will vary. In some areas, there are many applicants for the available licences, while in others the local authorities have great difficulty finding people willing to take on the responsibilities faced by the licence-holder, one of which is a 24 -h availability requirement [4].|$|R
