40|$|Rural {{financing}} in Thailand {{is heavily}} dependent on bank lending. Therefore, understanding the determinants of bank lending in the rural sector is an important element for promoting the development of credit accessibility to Thai farmers in the rural regions. Appropriate bank lending decisions would reduce lending costs and increase repayment rate and profits to the banks. Thus, a well-developed rural financial market would lead to sustainable development in the rural sector. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify critical factors in the bank lending decision and to investigate what factors affect the credit availability and loan price in rural lending in Thailand. This research also investigates the impact of the relationship lending (i. e., the relationship between the bank and the borrower) and the predictive power among the different estimation techniques in predicting the bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged. The data used in this research are obtained from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC). During the period of 2001 to 2003, a total of 18, 798 credit files under the normal loan scheme are made available. The credit files are analyzed using the logistic regression (Logit), multiple linear regression (MLR), and four different types of the artificial neural networks (ANN), namely multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (MLFN), Ward networks (WD), general regression neural networks (GRNN), and probabilistic neural networks (PNN). The results show that the total asset value (Asset), value of collateral (Collateral), and the length of the bank-borrower relationship (Duration) are crucial factors in determining bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged. As expected, Asset has a positive impact on the bank lending decision and the <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, while Collateral has a positive and a negative influence on the <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted and the interest rate charged, respectively. However, Collateral has no significant impact on the bank lending decision, while Asset has a significant negative impact on the loan price in some specifications. Duration has a significant negative impact on bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged, which implies the importance of relationship lending in the Thailand rural financial market. However, the negative relationships between Duration and the bank lending decision, and between Duration and the <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, contradict the postulated hypothesizes. The results imply that the bank uses information from the borrowers and monitors the lending risk via the lending decision and <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted. On the other hand, the relationship lending benefits the borrowers via loan pricing since the borrowers with a long term relationship with the bank receive a lower lending rate. The predictive results of both in-sample and out-of-sample on bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged show that in terms of predictive accuracy, most of the artificial neural networks models outperform the logistic and the multiple regression models. The empirical results also show the superiority of using the PNN model to classify and screen the loan applications, and the GRNN model to determine the <b>amount</b> of <b>credit</b> granted and interest rate charged...|$|R
40|$|The low credit-deposit {{ratio of}} the {{scheduled}} commercial banks in Kerala has been a subject of intense debate {{during the last decade}} or so. Periodically, the state government would raise the issue, lash out at the `negative attitude' of the banks for the lack of development of the state, the banks would counter it, and soon everyone would forget it. A systematic discussion of the various dimensions of it has been lacking. This paper makes a modest attempt to examine the issue. The C-D ratio {{is a product of the}} ratio of number of credit accounts to deposit accounts and the ratio of <b>credit</b> <b>amount</b> per account to deposit amount per account. While Kerala reports one of the highest ratio of number of credit accounts to deposit accounts, the <b>credit</b> <b>amount</b> per account is one of the lowest -deposit amount per account is comparable to the all-India level- among the states of India. The low <b>credit</b> <b>amount</b> is owing to the lack of credit deployment in industry, trade and finance. In particular, the <b>credit</b> <b>amount</b> per account in industry is very low largely because of higher share of food manufacturing and processing, other industries, and construction-which report low <b>amounts</b> of <b>credit</b> per account everywhere in India- in the total. Further, a comparison of the <b>amounts</b> per <b>credit</b> account in the small-scale industries with industry as a whole suggests that most of the industries in Kerala are no larger than small-scale industries. The small-scale industries in Kerala are also too small. credit-deposit ratio, Kerala, industry, small-scale industry...|$|R
