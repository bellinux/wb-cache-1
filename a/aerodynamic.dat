5|$|A single Jaguar was {{converted}} into the Jaguar Active Control Technology (ACT) with fly-by-wire controls and <b>aerodynamic</b> alterations to the airframe; the <b>aerodynamic</b> instability improved manoeuvrability {{and the test}} data {{was used in the}} development of the Eurofighter.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. <b>Aerodynamic</b> forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, <b>aerodynamic</b> drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, <b>aerodynamic</b> drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
5|$|Complex Air data {{computer}} (ADC) for {{the automated}} monitoring and transmission of <b>aerodynamic</b> measurements (total pressure, static pressure, angle of attack, side-slip).|$|E
5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and <b>aerodynamic</b> if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|A320 Enhanced family (or A320E family) is {{the working}} title {{for a series}} of {{improvements}} to the A320 family. The improvements include engine improvements, <b>aerodynamic</b> refinements– such as adding large curved winglets (Sharklets), weight savings, and a new cabin design.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or <b>aerodynamic)</b> design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
5|$|Coandă {{continued}} {{to work on the}} Coandă-1910 project at the beginning of 1911, aiming to improve stability, increase the power of the turbo-propulseur, and to implement aerofoil improvements. He applied for new patents for <b>aerodynamic</b> investigations and improvements of the Coandă-1910.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal <b>aerodynamic</b> efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for <b>aerodynamic</b> streamlining.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{he became}} the first driver to heat his rear tires with a burnout and he was the first driver to use smaller front tires on a dragster in 1958. Hill {{introduced}} the <b>aerodynamic</b> front wing to dragsters and charcoal masks for driver safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>aerodynamic</b> design of the blades, {{the design of a}} complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's rotor hub, nacelle, tower structure, generator, controls, and foundation.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Minardi débuted a new gearbox which was constructed out of titanium, the first for a Formula One team. Prost made {{modifications to}} their cars oil system to improve the reliability of their engines and made minor <b>aerodynamic</b> changes to the front wing and the floor. The team also used an updated version of their engine the Peugeot A20 EV2 during the Friday practice sessions and reverted to the EV3 {{for the remainder of the}} weekend. BAR fitted their cars with a revised <b>aerodynamic</b> package which included new bargeboards and rear wings.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised <b>aerodynamic</b> for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an <b>aerodynamic</b> set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 has a {{conventional}} <b>aerodynamic</b> layout with a shoulder-mounted trapezoidal wing and a traditional tailplane and rudder. Several metals {{are used in}} the construction of the airframe: 60% aluminium, 19% steel, 13.5% titanium, 2% magnesium alloy and 5.5% other materials.|$|E
5|$|The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on the}} F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no <b>aerodynamic</b> surface backup. The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other <b>aerodynamic</b> fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the <b>aerodynamic</b> performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|The later Firebrand T.F. Mk 5 {{featured}} minor <b>aerodynamic</b> {{improvements and}} 123 were converted from Mk IVs. The final version was the Firebrand T.F. Mk 5A with hydraulically boosted ailerons {{to increase the}} aircraft's rate of roll. Two Mk 5s and five Mk IVs were converted to the Mk 5A standard.|$|E
5|$|The net <b>aerodynamic</b> {{drag forces}} may be {{considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, <b>aerodynamic</b> lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Three {{team members}} – Toby Kane, Cameron Rahles-Rahbula and Mitchell Gourley {{undertook}} wind tunnel testing at Monash University in 2013 {{to assist them}} in determining their optimal <b>aerodynamic</b> position whilst skiing.|$|E
5|$|A D-21 {{mounted on}} an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. <b>Aerodynamic</b> covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's intake and exhaust to reduce drag, but {{had to be removed}} after the first few tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to <b>aerodynamic</b> heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the <b>aerodynamic</b> mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean <b>aerodynamic</b> wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of <b>aerodynamic</b> mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, Airbus {{announced that the}} new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any <b>aerodynamic</b> benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier <b>aerodynamic</b> package on Ralf Schumacher's car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Following the French Grand Prix on 2 July, six teams {{conducted}} testing {{sessions at}} the Silverstone Circuit between 4–6 July {{to prepare for}} the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring. Frentzen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing, ahead of Sauber's Pedro Diniz. Alexander Wurz's car was afflicted with an gearbox issue, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen for Arrows was quickest on the final day of testing, although his car's front wing was damaged when his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Ferrari and McLaren opted to test at the Mugello Circuit where both teams concentrated their efforts on <b>aerodynamic</b> and suspension set-ups between 4–7 July. Ferrari spent one further day performing shakedown runs of their cars at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Autódromo do Estoril between 5–7 July where testing consisted of tyre, engine, <b>aerodynamic</b> and set-up optimisation.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, <b>aerodynamic</b> wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E
5|$|Phantom's Revenge {{operates}} {{with two}} trains. Each train has seven cars that seat two riders in two rows {{for a total}} of 28 riders per train. After the ride was renovated, the trains were also renovated. Steel Phantom's chassis, that was built by Arrow remained but Morgan built new, <b>aerodynamic</b> fiberglass bodies. Morgan also replaced the over-shoulder-restraints with lap bars and seatbelts.|$|E
5|$|Rocket bombs, <b>aerodynamic</b> {{wings and}} {{explosive}} payloads: The first known rockets fitted with <b>aerodynamic</b> wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for <b>aerodynamic</b> research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). <b>Aerodynamic</b> improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, high-performance, {{supersonic}} interceptor {{prototype for}} a United States Air Force (USAF) series of lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for <b>aerodynamic</b> {{research and the}} other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104s were forerunners of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.|$|E
5|$|The Raptor's <b>aerodynamic</b> performance, sensor fusion, and stealth work {{together}} for increased effectiveness. Altitude, speed, and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft to spot targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range; altitude and speed also complement stealth's ability to increase the aircraft's survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its <b>aerodynamic</b> performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no <b>aerodynamic</b> changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|The casing {{was tested}} in a wind tunnel, and {{retained}} after it {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its <b>aerodynamic</b> form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver's vision with smoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (and {{the demands of}} flight) imply that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on pterosaur wings suggests that the coat {{did not have an}} <b>aerodynamic</b> function, lending support to the idea that pycnofibers evolved to aid pterosaur thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an endothermic metabolism.|$|E
