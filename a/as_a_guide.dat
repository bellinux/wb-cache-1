5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, at his own expense he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> to the sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that Grinsell had obtained through his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> to produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E

5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics {{not as a}} science but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> to good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide. He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented {{the large number of}} quacks who pretended to be doctors. In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E

5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E
5|$|Massasoit and Squanto were {{apprehensive}} about the Pilgrims. In Massasoit's first {{contact with the}} English, several men of his tribe {{had been killed in}} an unprovoked attack by English sailors. He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft of the corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges. Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship and had taken in Squanto.|$|E
