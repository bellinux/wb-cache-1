5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> scoring {{caused the}} wrong medals to be presented. In this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined {{based on a}} points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, {{to account for the}} different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of using IMUs for navigation {{is that they}} typically suffer from accumulated error. Because the guidance system is continually integrating acceleration with respect to time to calculate velocity and position (see dead reckoning), any measurement errors, however small, are accumulated over time. This leads to 'drift': an ever-increasing difference between where the system thinks it is located and the actual location. Due to integration <b>a</b> constant <b>error</b> <b>in</b> acceleration results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> linear <b>error</b> <b>in</b> velocity and <b>a</b> quadratic <b>error</b> growth <b>in</b> position. <b>A</b> constant <b>error</b> <b>in</b> attitude rate (gyro) results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quadratic <b>error</b> <b>in</b> velocity and <b>a</b> cubic <b>error</b> growth <b>in</b> position.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125m. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.|$|E
5|$|After Birmingham were relegated {{at the end}} of the season, {{the club}} took up their option of an extra year on Doyle's contract, despite accusations of {{inappropriate}} late-night drinking after the club's end-of-season dinner. He made 16 appearances in the 2011–12 season, including three matches in Birmingham's UEFA Europa League campaign, and both legs of the Championship play-off semi-final. He made <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> a 2–1 win over Maribor, where he misjudged a pass from Jonathan Spector to allow Dalibor Volaš to score the match's opening goal. In the FA Cup, Doyle saved two penalties from Juan Mata in the FA Cup; one in the initial fifth-round match, which finished 1–1, and one in the replay, which ended in a 2–0 defeat. His performance in the initial match against Chelsea resulted in him being named as the man of the match. At the end of the season, he received a special award for completing ten senior seasons with the club, extended to an eleventh when he signed a one-year contract, despite expectations that youngster Jack Butland might be first choice goalkeeper.|$|E

The other four Avengers ditched due to engine malfunctions, with no fatalities. Two Seafires, both piloted by the same airman, were also damaged in landing accidents. A book published to mark the 50th anniversary of the BPF described these losses as low by the standards of 1945.|$|E
5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E

5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E
5|$|The EO-13 crew {{departed}} on 22 July, {{and soon}} after Mir passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on Mir for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along Kristall {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of Kristall.|$|E
5|$|The Tales of Ise portrays Narihira as {{falling in}} love with , a consort of Emperor Seiwa, and it is hinted that {{this was one of the}} reasons for his leaving the capital and {{travelling}} east. It has been speculated that this romantic affair with the consort of the emperor was the reason why the Sandai Jitsuroku describes his rank as going down from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade, before again rising to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade the following year. However, it has also been speculated that this may be <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the Sandai Jitsuroku as a result of binding changing the order of events. Furthermore, Fujiwara no Takaiko reputedly had an affair with the monk , which may have formed the core of the otherwise fictional legend that she also had an affair with Narihira. Whether the affair was historical or not, the Reizei family's commentary on The Tales of Ise speculates that Emperor Yōzei was a product of this union, and not the previous emperor.|$|E

Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong.

5|$|Early on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard {{tank fire}} {{to the south of}} their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and {{infantry}} of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night. The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment, carried out a number of assaults. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position {{at the southern end of}} the bridge. At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded. At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, the surgeons had completed 31 operations, and the medics had treated 109 wounded.|$|E
