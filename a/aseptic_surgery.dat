2500|$|Emil Theodor Kocher (25 August 1841 – 27 July 1917) [...] was a Swiss {{physician}} and medical researcher {{who received the}} 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine {{for his work in}} the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid. Among his many accomplishments are the introduction and promotion of <b>aseptic</b> <b>surgery</b> and scientific methods in surgery, specifically reducing the mortality of thyroidectomies below 1% in his operations.|$|E
2500|$|Willie Lane {{was among}} the last {{surgeons}} of an era where one could master three specialties—orthopaedic, abdominal, and ear nose and throat—and some of his designed surgical instruments are still used today. Lane's introduction of the [...] "no-touch technique", which permitted <b>aseptic</b> <b>surgery,</b> is perhaps his greatest contribution to surgery. Even in the 21st century, particular descriptions by Lane [...] "should be required reading by orthopaedic surgeons". Lane's life ought to interest historians of medicine as well as believers in holistic medicine. In his time, some thought Lane a genius, while others disagreed, including Sir Arthur Keith who claimed him not clever but carried by faith. In any event, Lane can be characterised as [...] "a crusader, a perfectionist, and an extraordinarily talented surgeon".|$|E

50|$|He {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} with ocular {{motility}} disorders, particularly strabismus. He was a pioneer of <b>aseptic</b> ophthalmic <b>surgery</b> involving efforts for prevention of surgical complications such as endophthalmitis. Also, he is credited with providing an early detailed description of retinal ischemia, {{and was the first}} physician to perform an extirpation of the lacrimal sac.|$|R

2500|$|Widely {{respected}} for his simple, {{bold and}} direct operating technique, Whitehead said that [...] "the greatest drawback under which a surgeon can suffer is knowledge of anatomy– {{it makes him}} timid". His methods did not use antiseptic but instead relied on soap and water, as was common at the time. Unlike many surgeons of his generation, he was open to learning and using new techniques, {{such as those of}} Joseph Lister. He was described as [...] "one of the most go-ahead surgeons of his day" [...] by Arthur Burgess, in his 1929 Presidential Address to the BMA. Burgess also noted that Whitehead's preference for <b>aseptic</b> <b>surgery</b> was demonstrated at the MRI in 1895 with an unorthodox mastectomy that omitted the use of antiseptic on the wound and thus aroused both interest and misgivings. The success of the operation was instrumental in causing a shift of practice within the hospital towards aseptic surgical methods.|$|E
6000|$|But {{presently}} he {{had pushed}} the book away and was thinking over this novel and unpleasant idea that perhaps after all his age didn't matter as some ages have mattered {{and as he}} had hitherto always supposed it did matter. Byzantine, with the gold of life stolen and the swans changed to geese? Of course always {{there had been a}} certain qualification upon heroes, even Cæsar had needed a wreath, but at any rate the age of Cæsar had mattered. Kings no doubt might be more kingly and the issues of life plainer and nobler, but this had been true of every age. He tried to weigh values against values, our past against our present, temperately and sanely. Our art might perhaps be keener for beauty than it seemed to be, but still--it flourished. And our science at least was wonderful--wonderful. There certainly this young detractor of existing things went astray. What was there in Byzantium to parallel with the electric light, the electric tram, wireless telegraphy, <b>aseptic</b> <b>surgery?</b> Of course this about [...] "unchallenged social injustice" [...] was nonsense. Rant. Why! we were challenging social injustice at every general election--plainly and openly. And crime! What could the man mean about unscheduled crime? Mere words! There was of course a good deal of luxury, but not wicked luxury, and to compare our high-minded and constructive politics with the mere conflict of unscrupulous adventurers about that semi-oriental throne! It was nonsense! ...|$|E

30|$|Twenty-five live pigs were {{prepared}} for <b>aseptic</b> abdominal <b>surgery.</b> Four central venous catheters were inserted per animal into the epigastric veins and secured with {{four of the five}} securement systems studied, following a balanced incomplete randomized block design. A peak axial pull force test method was used to measure the force required to dislodge the catheter 1  cm from the insertion site and/or cause failure of the device and/or dressing. This pull test was done 10  min after device application, per constraints of the animal model. Comparison analysis was carried out using a mixed effects model with pig, sample, and sample location as factors. Non-inferiority testing was carried out using 95  % confidence intervals with a margin of 4.52  N or 1  lb (454  g). Tukey’s method was used to adjust for multiple pairwise comparisons.|$|R

40|$|There are no {{guidelines}} {{on the value}} of suction drainage fluid culture (SDC), {{and it is difficult to}} determine whether the organisms cultured from suction drainage fluid samples are pathogenic or simply contaminants. We performed 2989 cultures of suction drainage fluid samples obtained, during a 1 -year period, from 901 patients who underwent aseptic or septic orthopedic surgery (946 operations). The culture results were analyzed to evaluate their ability to detect postoperative infection after aseptic operations or to detect either a persistent or new episode of sepsis in patients known to have infection. For aseptic operations, the sensitivity of SDC was 25 %, the specificity was 99 %, the positive predictive value was 25 %, and the negative predictive value was 99 %. For septic operations, the sensitivity of SDC was 81 %, the specificity was 96 %, the positive predictive value was 87 %, and the negative predictive value was 94 %. We conclude that, for <b>aseptic</b> orthopedic <b>surgery,</b> SDC is not useful in detecting postoperative infection. However, for septic orthopedic surgery, it is of clinical importanc...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background The few available studies directly comparing aseptic and septic joint revision surgery report conflicting results. We investigated whether two-stage revision of septic hip prosthesis with a preformed antibiotic-loaded spacer and an uncemented prosthesis provides hip function {{and quality of}} life similar to those provided by <b>aseptic</b> revision <b>surgery</b> in the medium term, as well as the associated direct hospital costs. Materials and methods We prospectively evaluated the hip function (Harris hip score) {{and quality of life}} (WOMAC and SF- 12 scores) of 80 patients who underwent one-stage revision for aseptic loosening (Group A, 40 patients) or two-stage revision for septic total hip prostheses (Group S, 40 patients). Patients were matched for gender, age, and bone loss. A preformed antibiotic-loaded cement spacer was used for two-stage revision, and uncemented modular prostheses were implanted at revision in both groups. The minimum follow-up was 2 years (average 4 years; range 2 – 6 years). Results We found no difference in infection recurrence or aseptic loosening rate in the two groups. Average Harris hip score increased similarly in both groups: from 19. 1 to 74. ...|$|R
40|$|Surgery and {{critical}} illness often associate with cognitive decline. Surgical trauma or infection can independently lead to learning and memory impairments via similar, but not identical, cellular signaling of the {{innate immune system}} that promotes neuroinflammation. In this study we explored the putative synergism between <b>aseptic</b> orthopedic <b>surgery</b> and infection, the latter reproduced by postoperative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. We observed that surgery and LPS augmented systemic inflammation up to postoperative day 3 and this was associated with further neuroinflammation (CD 11 b and CD 68 immunoreactivity) in the hippocampus in mice compared to those received surgery or LPS alone. Administration of a selective alpha 7 subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR) agonist 2 hours after the LPS significantly improved neuroinflammation and hippocampal-dependent memory dysfunction. Modulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation in monocytes and regulation of the oxidative stress response through {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) signaling appear to be key targets in modulating this response. Overall, these results suggest that it may be conceivable to limit and possibly prevent postoperative complications, including cognitive decline and/or infections, through stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway...|$|R

30|$|Although patient {{satisfaction}} {{and quality of}} life improvements have been shown by different authors to be better after primary than after revision surgery in the hip [11, 12, 25, 29], little is known from prospective comparative studies about patient function {{and quality of life}} and the reasons for THA revision. On the other hand, conflicting results have been reported upon comparing septic and aseptic TKA revision, with some papers showing inferior [4, 33] and others superior [24, 26] knee scores and/or {{patient satisfaction}} and quality of life for two-stage septic versus <b>aseptic</b> TKA revision <b>surgery.</b> In this study, we compared the medium-term hip functions, QOLs, and complication rates of two cohorts of patients operated on for aseptic or septic THA revision.|$|R

50|$|He {{finished}} his secondary education in 1849 {{and graduated from}} the Royal Frederick University with the cand.med. degree in 1856. He worked in Christiania, Kragerø and Møre before becoming a surgeon for army companies in Stockholm (1857-1860) and Christiania (1862). He was hired at Rikshospitalet in 1863; from 1867 to 1870 he was {{a research fellow at}} the university (including thirteen months in the United States). He was {{a professor at the university}} and chief physician at Rikshospitalet, until retiring from both posts in 1908. His special field was surgery, but he was also a prominent scholar in dentistry. He was the first in Norway to perform ovarectomy (1866), resection in the knee (1881) and resection in the bowel (1885). He also contributed significantly to the introduction of antiseptic, later <b>aseptic</b> methods in <b>surgery.</b>|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{experience}} of total excision in a 14 -year-old female with intramedullary epidermoid cyst was reported. The patient with L 3 - 4 intramedullary epidermoid cyst underwent total excision through posterior median approach under microscopy. The patient was admitted for progressive strephexopodia and urinary and fecal incontinence. Preoperative imaging examination showed scoliosis, incontionous L 4 -S 1 and abnormal signal of L 3 - 4. Total excision and spinal remodeling were performed under intraoperative neurophysiological monitoning. Epidermoid cyst and its membrane were totally removed without <b>aseptic</b> meningitis after <b>surgery,</b> and the neurologic {{symptoms of the}} patient were gradually improved. Completely removing the membrane of epidermoid cyst is the key point to prevent recurrence and aseptic meningitis postoperatively.

50|$|Pringle made a {{particular}} {{study of the}} treatment of fractures, where he was at an advantage because X-rays had been introduced very early into clinical practice in Glasgow Royal Infirmary, an innovation that allowed Pringle to gain wide personal experience of fractures and their management. His colleague John Macintyre (1857-1928) had established the world's first x-ray service for patients in Glasgow Royal Infirmary in March 1896. This allowed James Hogarth Pringle an early, perhaps unique experience in fracture diagnosis and management using x-rays, and {{formed the basis for}} his book on fractures and their treatment.He had the added advantage of working in the hospital where Joseph Lister had first introduced antisepsis and would surely have been aware of his own father's work on antisepsis in introducing Listerian antisepsis into Australia. He was, like Sir William Macewen, an early exponent of <b>aseptic</b> technique in <b>surgery.</b> Both of these factors undoubtedly contributed to his expertise and success with fracture management.|$|R
30|$|The {{study used}} 26 large female farm pigs (48 [*]±[*] 3  kg) {{obtained}} from Palmetto Research Swine (Reevesville, SC, USA) and {{was completed in}} the surgical suite of a facility specializing in pre-clinical models (Synchrony Labs, Durham, NC, USA). The pigs were sedated with Telazol® (4 – 6  mg/kg) prior to the procedure, and general anesthesia was induced using 5  % isoflurane dispensed through a face mask and maintained with 2 – 2.5  % isoflurane via endotracheal tube. Animals {{were placed on the}} surgery table in dorsal recumbence. Standard ECG leads were applied, and a venous catheter was placed for infusion of fluids in the ear, a location away from the test sites. The animals were intubated, anesthetized, and ventilated prior to testing and were prepared for <b>aseptic</b> abdominal <b>surgery</b> using a standard procedure. The hair on the abdomen was removed using an animal clipper with a # 40 blade, and the area was washed with water only. The abdomen was then wiped with 70  % isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Each insertion site on the abdomen was scrubbed with a 10.5  ml, clear ChloraPrep® Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation (CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA), a 2  % chlorhexidine gluconate/ 70  % isopropyl alcohol formulation. The ChloraPrep® was allowed to air-dry for at least 5  min to ensure optimal adhesion of the products to skin. In the case of the securement device, the skin was further prepped with the skin protectant included with the device and allowed to dry. During the procedure, animals were monitored for the presence of spontaneous movement and blood oxygen saturation and if needed, appropriate adjustments to anesthesia were made. At the end of the procedure, the animals were given a dose of 40  mEq IV of potassium chloride (KCl) and removed from the ventilator following the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines on euthanasia [12].|$|R

2500|$|An {{incision}} is made {{to access}} the surgical site. [...] Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors {{may be used to}} expose the site or keep the incision open. [...] The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum. [...] In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in <b>surgery</b> <b>aseptic</b> technique is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the patient's body that will be operated on.Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.|$|R
40|$|Rats with Metabolic Syndrome (MetaS) have a {{dysregulated}} {{immune response}} to the <b>aseptic</b> trauma of <b>surgery.</b> We hypothesized that rats with MetaS would have dysregulated inflammation, increased lung injury, and less effective antibacterial defenses during Staphylococcus (S.) aureus sepsis as compared to rats without MetaS. Low capacity runner (LCR; a model of MetaS) and high capacity runner (HCR) rats were challenged intravenously with S. aureus bacteria. After 48 h, inflammatory mediators and bacteria were quantified in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung homogenates. Lungs were analyzed histologically. BALF protein and lung wet-dry ratios were quantified to assess for vascular leak. Endpoints were compared in infected LCR vs HCR rats. LCR rats had higher blood and lung S. aureus counts, as well as higher levels of IL- 6 in plasma, lungs and BALF, MIP- 2 in plasma and lung, and IL- 17 A in lungs. Conversely, LCR rats had lower levels of IL- 10 in plasma and lungs. Although lactate levels, and liver and renal function tests were similar between groups, LCR rats had higher BALF protein and lung wet-dry ratios, and more pronounced acute lung injury histologically. During S. aureus bacteremia, as compared with HCR rats, LCR (MetaS) rats have heightened pro-inflammatory responses, accompanied by increased acute lung injury and vascular leak. Notably, despite an augmented pro-inflammatory phenotype, LCR rats have higher bacterial levels in their blood and lungs. The MetaS state may exacerbate lung injury and vascular leak by attenuating the inflammation-resolving response, and by weakening antimicrobial defenses...|$|R
40|$|Besides an atraumatic procedure, <b>aseptic</b> {{techniques}} during <b>surgery</b> {{have been}} suggested {{to have a positive}} impact on the predictability of osseointegration. To avoid an infection of the surgical field, coverage of the face of the patient (drapes) and nose (surgical mask, drape and plastic film) were advocated in order to reduce airborne infections and to prevent a contact contamination of instruments and gloves. Such a coverage, however, increases the feeling of claustrophobia when local anaesthesia is used and can lead to hypoxemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the expired air via the nostrils could contribute to the contamination of the oral surgical field. Test blood agar plates were installed for 30 min under the nose of volunteers lying on a surgical table; once with full coverage of their nostrils, as indicated above, and once without. Simultaneously, control plates were installed on a table besides the patient to measure the basic contamination from the environment. All plates were incubated both aerobically and anaerobically. The number of colony forming units (c. f. u.) recorded on test plates after aerobic and anaerobic incubation were surprisingly low, with a mean score of 2. 7 and 5. 0 c. f. u. for the uncovered situation, and 2. 5 and 3. 3 c. f. u. for the covered situation, respectively. The control plates were infected by a nearly comparable number of bacteria (means ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 2). These findings indicate that covering nostrils by a mask and sterile adhesive plastic film is not essential in avoiding airborne microbial contamination. However, the use of a meshed nose guard to prevent contact with the highly contaminated nasal skin is highly recommended. status: publishe...|$|R
