Instead, the college began to expand at other locations in Quincy, buying {{a piece of land}} along Hancock Street later that year, and the year after that purchasing an <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcel</b> along Old Colony Avenue, which had once been home to a Howard Johnson's candy factory and executive offices. In 1997, the college extended beyond the metro Boston area for the first time when it started a learning annex in central Massachusetts to serve as part of its adult studies division. The Old Colony Campus (OCC), as the new site on Old Colony Avenue had come to be named, was renovated and expanded into the Adams Executive Center. The Cecil R. Paul Center for Business was founded at the Old Colony location in 1999, and the James R. Cameron Center for History, Law, & Government was added in 2005. In 2001, just before the end of his second term, then-president Kent R. Hill was appointed the new Global Health Administrator for USAID. In 2008, ENC established satellite campuses in Boston, Brockton, Fall River, and Swansea, Massachusetts. In 2010, Eastern Nazarene College was ranked in the top tier for northern U.S. regional colleges in U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges report. It was also ranked 28th overall (specifically 25th in number of graduates going on to earn PhDs and 11th in number of alumni serving in the Peace Corps, relative to college size) by the Washington Monthly College Guide for baccalaureate colleges nationally in 2010.|$|E

Originally housed in quarters in 4th Street, the present building was constructed in 1869, with funding support from a bequest by Franklin Pitcher. It was designed by Henry W. Hartwell, then early in his career, and is believed {{to be one of the}} first examples of the state of Stick style decoration. [...] The land was donated by James Smith, Jr., and an <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcel</b> was donated by Samuel Prentiss in 1914, for use as a playground. At Pitcher's demand, the facility's purpose was broadened to include boys, and the organization was rechartered and renamed in 1866 as the Bangor Children's Home. [...] By the 1970s, funding and treatment models had changed, and the boarding services were no longer needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{town had}} its visionary, W.R. Hendricks. In May 1890 {{there were only}} a couple of {{dwellings}} scattered around the area that is Claxton. Hendricks, son of Glenn and Nancy Hendricks, had been given a large tract of land by his parents. The Hendricks' ambition was to secure a railroad station at the site, but they met considerable opposition from railroad company officials who maintained that existing stations in the area were sufficient to meet the needs. W.R. Hendricks made a proposition to railroad officials that a well be dug and pump installed free of charge so that trains could stop for water. The deal was made and actual construction began {{in the latter part of}} June 1890. The vision of building a town was fully supported by Hendricks' mother, who offered to give a lot to anyone who would erect a building upon it. A number of people accepted her offer, so she revised the plan and proposed to sell one lot and give the <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcel</b> to those who desired to build.|$|E

5000|$|In Polish literature, {{the prison}} is {{commonly}} referred to simply as więzienie przy ulicy Czarnieckiego ("the prison in Czarniecki Street"). The facility comprises the main building, constructed in 1905 (since 1996 listed in the register of historical monuments), and the <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcel</b> of land covering 3,133 square metres and surrounding the building {{on both sides and}} at the back (bounded on the south by the ulica Rękawka). [...] The grounds were used by the Nazis as execution grounds during the Second World War which ended here with the liberation of Cracow on 18 January 1945. The facility was used by the Nazis as a de facto subsidiary (Zweiganstalt) of the significantly larger facility in the ulica Monte&shy;lu&shy;pich. Among the nu&shy;me&shy;rous victims murdered here is counted the Polish poet, Zuzanna Ginczanka. [...] The prison is mentioned in the diaries of Holocaust sur&shy;vi&shy;vors, such as Stanisław Taubenschlag (b. 1920; the son of Rafał Taubenschlag), and was the place of imprisonment by the Nazis of Polish elite represented by the sculptor, Jan Krzyczkowski (1910&shy;1980). It appears in the memoirs of Tadeusz Pan&shy;kie&shy;wicz, the pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;tor of the famous [...] "Under the Eagle" [...] pharmacy (Apteka Pod Orłem) nearby, featured in the award-winning film, Schindler's List. The var&shy;i&shy;ous methods of torture used by the Nazis against the detainees included an early form of waterboarding performed in a bathtub full of water, which close family members of the victims specially brought to the prison for the occasion were made to witness as an added terror tactic (e.g., in the case of Józef Świstak nom de guerre Bunkier, a member of the Szare Szeregi, d. 1944, whose mother was made to witness his mar&shy;tyr&shy;dom). The prison was a military target in the attempts by the Armia Krajowa to free prisoners incarcerated there.&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy; Most of those imprisoned at Czarnieckiego 3 could not be helped.|$|E

The overall {{property}} was roughly square and fronted onto Colombo and Salisbury Streets, a {{location in the}} north of the Christchurch Central City. According to records held by the valuation department, construction of the house started in 1902. The house was built on Lot 3 of the property (the northern section), and Lot 4, facing Salisbury Street, had a garage and a bowling green. Construction was completed in 1904. The house was connected to the city drains in April 1904, {{but it was not until}} 1923 that electricity was supplied to the building. Water came initially from an artesian well on the property.|$|R
50|$|Two {{purchases}} of <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcels</b> {{from the original}} landowners {{made it possible for}} the school district to expand the school in 1930 with eight new classrooms, the auditorium and cafeteria in the north wing. Tooker & Marsh of New York City were the architects this time, producing a structure compatible with the main block. The south wing came almost three decades later, after Spring Valley's schools, once again facing an influx of students with the suburbanization of the area after construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the post-World War II baby boom, were consolidated into the Ramapo Central School District No. 2 in 1952. Schofield & Cogan designed the south wing, which opened in 1957, and more land was purchased to accommodate future expansions, if necessary.|$|R

The first years traffic to Store Torv still went through Fredensgade and Skolegade but when St. Clemens Bridge opened in 1884 Ryesgade and Søndergade became the main thoroughfare connecting the central station and the newly developing neighborhood Frederiksbjerg south {{of it to the}} old city center north of the river.

It was purchased by the most recent owners, Edic Sliva and Lisa Tollner for $1.7 million in 2005. They bought the property along with other <b>adjoining</b> <b>parcels</b> of land, intending to turn the area into a development consisting of condominiums. Construction never got off the ground.
