50|$|<b>Aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> may be {{sensitive}} to intergranular corrosion if there are layers of materials acting as anodes between the aluminium-rich crystals. High strength aluminium alloys, especially when extruded or otherwise subjected to high degree of working, can undergo exfoliation corrosion, where the corrosion products build up between the flat, elongated grains and separate them, resulting in lifting or leafing effect and often propagating from edges of the material through its entire structure. http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Forms-exfoliation/exfoliation.htm Intergranular corrosion is a concern especially for alloys with high content of copper.|$|R

A series of experiments have been carried out to investigate the effect of pre-strain, annealing time and annealing temperature on static recovery kinetics of <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> and copper-based alloys. The static recovery kinetics is then modelled using an empirical static recovery kinetic model. Analysis of activation energies of the above mentioned metallic alloys also suggests that static recovery process could be model using isochronal experimental data...|$|R

It is also the mechanically strongest alloy in the series, and is the only 1000-series alloy commonly used in rivets. At the same time, it keeps the benefits of being relatively lightly alloyed (compared to other series), such as high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, and workability. It can be strengthened by cold working, but not by heat treatment.|$|E

As a wrought alloy, {{it is not}} used in castings. Instead, it is usually formed by extrusion or rolling. It is commonly used in the electrical and chemical industries, on account of having high electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, and workability. 1050 alloy is also sometimes used for the manufacture of heat sinks, since it has a higher thermal conductivity than other alloys. It has low mechanical strength compared to more significantly alloyed metals. It can be strengthened by cold working, but not by heat treatment.|$|E

Mechanical testing shows that metallic foams provide excellent ewnergy dissipation features, but on a much higher strength level as compared to foamed organic materials.

This work investigated the thermal oxidation of Zn and Al nanoalloys (nAlZn) with a BET equivalent diameter of 141 nm through the simultaneous TGA/DSC method. The thermal analysis was combined with elemental, morphology and crystalline structure analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanisms. It was found that the complete oxidation of nAlZn in air can be characterised by a three-stage process, including two endothermic and three exothermic reactions. With the help of ex-situ XRD, different reaction pathways were proposed for different stages, forming the end products of ZnO and ZnAl 2 O 4. The reactivity comparison between Al and nAlZn suggested that different criteria should be used for different applications...|$|R

Their ballistic properties are comprehensively reviewed, with useful tables of essential {{physical and chemical}} properties, {{as well as their}} over-riding sets of engineering properties. Whilst thick-sectioned, high-strength, <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> are competitive choices for light armoured vehicles, they are still prone to failure by discing and spalling, as well as the effects of stress corrosion cracking, even after decades of research. In fact, discing is shown to be the Achilles heel of all three alloy families and the low strength of the magnesium alloys seriously compromises its future development. On the other hand, the titanium alloys remain an attractive option for bullet-resistant light alloy development, especially for applique applications...|$|R

While there has been much effort spent in the development of electrochemistry-based models, the use of grey and black-box models remains largely unexplored.

40|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the selection of}} materials for cast structures is keeping a proper balance between the mechanical and plastic properties, while preserving the relevant casting properties. This study has been devoted to an analysis of the choice and application of high-strength <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> maintaining sufficient level of casting properties. The high level of tensile strength (Rm > 500 MPa) matched with satisfactory elongation (A > 3 %) is important because materials of this type are used for cast parts operating in the aerospace, automotive, and military industries. These beneficial relationships between the high tensile strength and toughness are relatively easy to obtain in the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys subjected to plastic forming and proper heat treatment. In gravity cast products, on the other hand, whether poured into sand moulds or metal moulds (dies), obtaining this favourable combination of properties poses a number of research problems (mostly resulting from the alloy chemical composition) as well as technical and technological difficulties...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe study, {{was carried}} out by {{developing}} the alloy using the foundry route of melting, alloying, and casting. The produced test samples were machined to produce test specimens which were subjected to precipitation hardening treatment. The test specimens were for impact and hardness test to inference the response of the developed alloy to age hardening treatment. The ageing temperature was 190 o C, and the ageing time was from 1 - 5 hrs. The control specimen was not age hardened and when compared with the age hardened specimens, the tested mechanical properties of the age hardened specimens were better than the control specimen. The hardness was seen to increase, with ageing time peaking at 3 hrs of ageing to a value of 38. 34 HRB, dropped and rose after 4 hrs of ageing and continued to increase, thereby prompting curiosity. The toughness had a steady increase as the ageing time was increased, which clearly showed that the developed alloy responded to age hardening treatment. Introduction. A lot of <b>aluminium–based</b> <b>alloys</b> have been developed and characterized {{as can be seen in}} B. S. Aerospace Series, section L (aluminium and light alloys). Specification of the <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> is clearly stated unfortunately the specification for this research work could not be sighted however, close compositions were seen. According to the wrought aluminum alloy designation system, alloys of these series (Al-Si-Mg) are designated 6 xxx. Aluminum – Magnesium – Silicon alloys are heat treatable [2, 5, 11]. Solution treatment followed by either artificial or natural ageing allows considerable increase in yield-strength (3 - 5 times). Ductility of the alloy decreases as a result of the heat treatment. Hardening of the alloys from this group is achieved due to precipitation of the phase Mg-Si occurring during ageing [5]. The phase has a fixed ratio between the elements content (valence compound), therefore amount of magnesium and silicon in 6 xxx alloys is balance according to this ratio or with an excess of silicon. Alloys of this series possess high mechanical strength combined with good formability and corrosion resistance. Excess of silicon enhances effect of precipitation of the alloys but decreases their ductility because of segregation of silicon in the regions of grain boundaries. This adverse effect of silicon may be diminished by addition of chromium and manganese depressing recrystalization during solution treatment. Temperature of artificial ageing of 6 xxx alloys is 320 – 360 o F (160 – 182...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{advantages}} of <b>Aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> for structural use is their corrosion resistance. However, while Aluminium alloys are highly resistant to uniform (general) corrosion, {{they are much more}} susceptible to types of localised corrosion, especially intergranular corrosion, which is a localised attack along the grain boundaries which leaves the grains themselves largely unaffected. In order to estimate the progress of such corrosion in a given sample, it is considered possible to generate a numerical model of some sort. While there has been much effort spent in the development of electrochemistry-based models, the use of grey and black-box models remains largely unexplored. One exception to this is the use of Cellular Automata (CA) models which have recently been exploited to model the progression of uniform corrosion. The object of the current paper is to apply the CA methodology to the case of intergranular corrosion. The first phase of the work has been concerned with generating appropriate CA rules which can qualitatively reproduce observed physics, and this work is reported here. A model is proposed which shows qualitative agreement with experimental data on the advance of the corrosion front...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} work made {{as part of}} the eHeroes project (eheroes. eu). The goal is to assess the doses that astronauts may receive during future {{journeys}} outside the Earth's magnetosphere. The final goal is to develop a data-driven tool able to predict doses on human tissues when specific conditions are defined, including thicknesses of the layers and the type of exposure, using data provided by some satellite. The first part of this work extesively uses the SPENVIS toolpackage {{in order to have a}} general view on results obtained from satistical models implemented within it. In particular, two future interplantery travels are taken into account: the journey to the Moon and to Mars, according to schedules planned by world-wide space agencies, predominantly NASA and ESA. Due to the lack of the knowledge on the final dimensions, shapes and materials, we decided to maintain the analysis as general as possible, by utilizing those tools provided by SPENVIS which considers pre-calculated coefficients and pre-configurated values. Finally, the DREADCode (www. spaceweather. eu/biological_effects) is developed in order to assess the doses with data input from different and more realistic sources, such as databases from ongoing missions, including ACE and GOES. By considering the same materials, which are predominantly <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys,</b> thicknesses and surfaces, results from both tools are compared and discussed, in order to validate this approach and maintain a general and conservative computation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> {{present a}} number of {{interesting}} properties, such as lower density, corrosion resistance, thermal and electrical conductivity and good recyclability. For this reason, {{there is a strong}} trend in increasing the use of these alloys, particularly in the automotive industry [1, 2]. However, aluminium alloys show poor formability at room temperature, and the production of complex components requires a series of high temperature forming processes, such as warm and hot forging, extrusion and hot sheet metal forming [3]. Forming aluminium in these conditions subjects the tools to severe adhesive wear and galling, leading to increased energy needs, shorter tool life, lower part quality and increased cost. In this work, the wear mechanisms generated by aluminium alloys on forming tools have been studied by means of linear reciprocating sliding tests, performed in an Optimol SRV equipment. Balls of two different compositions (AA 2017 and 99 % pure aluminium) were slid against DIN 1. 2344 (AISI H 13) tool steel samples with various surface finishes at temperatures up to 450 ºC. The resulting wear tracks were studied by means of confocal microscopy and electron microscopy (SEM/BSE). The main results show that the observed wear mechanisms are extremely dependent on the system temperature, ranging from pure abrasive wear to formation of layers of compacted aluminium debris and gross aluminium transfer in the form of lumps. The choice of aluminium alloy can be very relevant on the wear behaviour of the system. On the other hand, tool surface finish has a limited effect on material transfer. [1] Miller W S, et al.

40|$|Currently, {{intricate}} {{problems of}} surface treatment {{can be solved}} through precision cladding using advanced laser technology.

The current availability of high-power diode lasers makes laser cladding essentially more efficient and practicable.

40|$|Quasicrystals are <b>aluminium-based</b> <b>alloys</b> – inter-metallic solids, indeed – {{characterized}} by long-range order and absence of periodicity {{in the distribution}} of atomic maximum probability locations. And periodicity is typical of standard crystals. In contrast, quasi-periodicity is the characteristic feature of quasicrystal lattices: we have, in fact, prevailing atomic clusters – typically with icosahedral symmetry in 3 D space, which is incompatible with lattice translations – and additional atomic arrangements determining the quasi-periodic structure. When we evaluate Fourier representation of mass density over such a quasi-periodic lattice of atoms in 3 D ambient space, the related wave vectors result six dimensional to render compatible the expansion with the quasi-periodic geometry. Three of these six degrees of freedom can be attributed to finer spatial scale flips of atoms which annihilate and reconstruct quasi-periodicity in going from metastable states to stable ones and vice versa, depending on the interaction with the surrounding environment. These microstructural events influence even drastically the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of quasicrystals and non-standard actions (in the sense that they do not admit a representation in terms of standard Cauchy’s stress alone) are power conjugated with them. The micro-to-macro coupling is essentially stochastic [1]. In presence of fractures growing dynamically, such microstructural actions influence the force driving the crack tip. Here, we present an overview of questions connected with the dynamic propagation of fractures in quasicrystals. 1. In finite strain setting, we show (by following the general theoretical structure presented in [2] for the mechanics of simple and complex materials undergoing macroscopic mutations such as fractures) how the laws of dynamics crack propagation in quasicrystals derive from a requirement of invariance of what is called relative power. The procedure puts in evidence the existence of a bulk conservative self-action, in contrast with common formulations of the mechanics of quasicrystals where the conservative part of the self-action is neglected. 2. In the limit of vanishing conservative self-action, and within the limitations of small strain regime, by using Stroh’s formalism we provide solutions to boundary value problems involving dynamic steady-state crack propagation in quasicrystals [3]. 3. Finally, in small strain regime we present solutions to boundary value problems involving subsonic crack propagation between dissimilar quasicrystals [4] and allow comparison between the cases of presence and absence of conservative microstructural self-action...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of lithium-ion and/or super-capacitor battery technologies is a current hot {{topic in the}} automotive industry. For both battery types, the terminals and busbars are manufactured from copper (Cu) and/or <b>aluminium-based</b> (Al-based) <b>alloys,</b> {{as a result of}} their high electrical and thermal conductivities. Laser welding is considered an attractive process to industry due to its easy auto-motability, high processing speed and highly repeatable cost-effective processing. However, laser welding of monometallic and dissimilar Cu and A 1 presents several difficulties due to the high surface reflectivity at infrared (IR.) wavelengths. Three main areas were investigated in this research work: • Laser beam lap-welding of monometallic Cu sheets, with the aim of validating the developed welding procedures against target specifications addressed by the automotive industry, in line with production environment setups. • The suitability of using tailored energy distributions, produced using a 1070 nm laser source delivered through a laser beam scanner, for welding multiple overlapping Al or Cu foils. • The effects of different laser processing parameters on the formation of deleterious brittle intermetallic phases when welding Alto Cu with a continuous-wave Yb-fibre laser. ...|$|R

Effects of operating time, current density and initial concentration of Cr(III) and COD have been investigated.

Dilution of the waste has been tested for treatment: high abatement levels could be obtained with shorter time of treatment and lower current densities.

40|$|The European Aluminium alloys foundry {{industry}} (more than 2000 Companies, mostly SMEs) has {{an enormous}} potential, associated to the increasing demand of lightweight components in various application fields, from automotive to aerospace. This potential has still to be fully exploited. European Aluminium foundry industry is now facing the challenge of transforming itself into a quality/efficiency-driven and integration-oriented sector. This target requires the achievement of several intermediate objectives, such as {{the development of new}} and advanced Standards and Technical Reports, supporting a systematic improvement in design and production of high quality and highly performing cast components. This is the scenario in which the EU financed StaCast project (FP 7 -NMP- 2012 -CSA- 6, Grant n. 319188) has been carried out, with the joint effort of University of Padova (Italy), Aalen Hochschule Technik und Wirtschaft (Germany), Trondheim Norges Universitet (Norway), Associazione Italiana di Metallurgia (Italy), Assomet Servizi (Italy), and Federation of Aluminium Consumers Europe (Belgium). The acronym StaCast means “New Quality and Design Standards for Aluminium Alloys Cast Products”, and the Project has been focussed on - a public survey of EU Aluminium foundries, to understand their more relevant characteristics, particularly for what concerns quality and standardisation issues, - the development of a reliable classification of defects and imperfections in Al Alloys cast products, transferred to CEN (European Committee for Stardardisation) as an official Technical Report, - the development of a procedure for the evaluation of mechanical potential of <b>Aluminium-based</b> foundry <b>alloys,</b> transferred to CEN (European Committee for Stardardisation) as an official Technical Report, - the elaboration of engineering guidelines for the mechanical design of Al alloys castings.

50|$|High-strain-rate {{superplasticity}} {{has been}} observed in <b>aluminium-based</b> and magnesium-based <b>alloys.</b> But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides {{with the presence of}} cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite(3Al2O3•2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.|$|R
