40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} design, usage, {{and evaluation of}} a highly generic music constraint system called Strasheela. Strasheela simplifies the definition of musical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) by predefining building blocks required for such problems. At the same time, Strasheela preserves {{a high degree of}} generality and is reasonably efficient. Strasheela is highly generic, because it is highly programmable. In particular, three fundamental components are more programmable in Strasheela compared with existing music constraint systems: the music representation, the rule <b>application</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the search process. Strasheela features an expressive symbolic music representation. This representation supports explicitly storing score information by sets of score objects, their attributes, and their hierarchic nesting. Any information available in the score is accessible from any object in the score and can be used to obtain derived information. The representation is complemented by the notion of variables: score information can be unknown and suc...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of anodized aluminum pressure sensitive paint (AA-PSP) is documented. The study consisted {{of the development of}} AA-PSP and its application to unsteady aerodynamic fields at atmospheric conditions. Luminophore <b>application</b> <b>mechanism</b> and two-component application on anodized aluminum was studied for the development. Two-component application includes hydrophobic-coated AA-PSP and bi-luminophore system. It was found that the polarity of solvents and the surface charge of anodized aluminum determine the optimized luminophore application. As a result, a wide variation of luminophore can be applied on anodized aluminum. To apply both components on anodized aluminum, optimum solvent polarities for each component should match. AA-PSP performances, such as pressure sensitivity, temperature dependency, signal level, and aging were improved by the luminophore <b>application</b> <b>mechanism</b> and two-component application. ^ AA-PSPs demonstrate the capability of measuring surface pressures on unsteady aerodynamic fields. For an application to the Purdue Mach 4 Quiet Flow Ludwieg Tube, surface pressures on the order of a hundred Pascals were measured for approximately 200 ms. The measurement uncertainty of the pressure was on the order of 5 %. The main uncertainty source comes from fitting the adsorption control model to calibration points. The results compared qualitatively well to CFD calculations. A miniature fluidic oscillator was used to demonstrate the capability of measuring oscillating unsteady aerodynamic fields with 6. 4 kHz primary frequency. Flow oscillation images as well as pressure maps of various phases were captured by AA-PSP with PtTFPP as a luminophore (AA-PSPPtTFPP). Main uncertainty source comes from fitting the adsorption control model to calibration points and from the pulse width of illumination. The measurement uncertainty of the pressure was 4. 68 %. AA-PSPPtTFPP was applied to a high-amplified acoustic fielding in a standing wave tube. The maximum pressure change created was 171 dB (1. 04 psi). Sinusoidal pressure wave images inside a standing wave tube were captured at various phases. From these images, the integrated pressure map was obtained. In this case, measurement uncertainty was 3. 64 % and was due mainly to the pulse width and from fitting of the adsorption controlled model. Comparison with theoretical model is necessary to validate the integrated map as a streaming pattern. ...|$|E

QACs have different impacts on the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibacterials depending on the antibacterial compound investigated, the resistance genes involved, the measuring methodology and the interpretative criteria.

40|$|A {{learning}} {{neural network}} (30) implements a random weight change learning algorithm within a weight adjustment mechanism (28) for manipulating the weights applied to inputs {{of the network}} (30) {{in order to achieve}} a desired functionality for the network (30). Weights are changed randomly from an initial state with a small incremental weight change of either +? or -?. If the overall network output decreases by the weight change, the same weight change is iterated until the error increases. If, however, the overall network error increases, the weights are changed randomly again. After iterating the foregoing methodology, the network error gradually decreases and finally reaches approximately zero. Furthermore, a shift mechanism (36) and a multiplier (38) are employed as a weight <b>application</b> <b>mechanism</b> (16).
