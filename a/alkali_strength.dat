40|$|Most of {{the mineral}} matter was {{extracted}} from Illinois No. 6 coal, a representative bituminous coal, by first leaching {{it with a}} hot alkaline solution {{and then with a}} dilute mineral acid. The alkalis employed, in decreasing effectiveness, were: (1) NaOH, (2) Na 2 CO 3, (3) NaHCO 3. The results generally agreed with those obtained in leaching quartz, kaolinite, and iron pyrite individually under similar conditions. The quartz was solubilized by the stronger alkalis. Kaolinite was largely converted to sodium hydroaluminosilicates such as analcime, hydroxycancrinite, and natrodavyne.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} on alkaline pretreatment has mainly focused on optimization {{of the process}} parameters to improve substrate digestibility. To achieve satisfactory sugar yield, extremely high chemical loading and enzyme dosages were typically used. Relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to reduction of chemical consumption and process waste management, which has proven to be an indispensable component of the bio-refineries. To indicate <b>alkali</b> <b>strength,</b> both alkali concentration in pretreatment solution (g alkali/g pretreatment liquor or g alkali/L pretreatment liquor) and alkali loading based on biomass solids (g alkali/g dry biomass) have been widely used. The dual approaches make it difficult to compare the chemical consumption in different process scenarios while evaluating the cost effectiveness of this pretreatment technology. The current work addresses these issues through pretreatment of corn stover at various combinations of pretreatment conditions. Enzymatic hydrolysis with different enzyme blends was subsequently performed to identify the effects of pretreatment parameters on substrate digestibility as well as process operational and capital costs. Results The results showed that sodium hydroxide loading is the most dominant variable for enzymatic digestibility. To reach 70 % glucan conversion while avoiding extensive degradation of hemicellulose, approximately 0. 08 g NaOH/g corn stover was required. It was also concluded that alkali loading based on total solids (g NaOH/g dry biomass) governs the pretreatment efficiency. Supplementing cellulase with accessory enzymes such as α-arabinofuranosidase and β-xylosidase significantly improved the conversion of the hemicellulose by 6 – 17 %. Conclusions The current work presents the impact of alkaline pretreatment parameters on the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover as well as the process operational and capital investment costs. The high chemical consumption for alkaline pretreatment technology indicates that the main challenge for commercialization is chemical recovery. However, repurposing or co-locating a biorefinery with a paper mill would be advantageous from an economic point of view. </p...|$|E

40|$|Tetrahedral iron (III) {{environments in}} alkali–alkaline earth–silica glasses {{have been studied}} as {{functions}} of alkali and alkaline earth cation type and Fe 2 O 3 content using photoluminescence and optical absorption spectroscopies. The luminescence band centered at 13 000 – 15, 500 cm− 1 is attributed to the 4 T 1 (G) → 6 A 1 (S) transition of tetrahedral Fe 3 + ions. This band has Gaussian linewidths of 1500 – 3000 cm− 1 but linewidths exhibit no clear compositional dependency. Ligand field strength, 10 Dq, and the Racah parameters B and C are consistent with tetrahedral Fe 3 + and {{here for the first}} time their linear variation with the alkali/alkaline earth ratio of ionic radii, cation field strengths or individual oxide basicities is demonstrated. This is attributed to the effects of near-neighbor cations on length and covalency of Fe 3 +–O bonds and on host glass structure. Alkali cations stabilize Fe 3 + ions in tetrahedral coordination; stabilization increases linearly with increasing alkali ionic radius and therefore with decreasing <b>alkali</b> field <b>strength.</b> The role of alkaline earth cations in Fe 3 + stabilization in these glasses is not clear, although their effect is the inverse of that of the alkalis. The structural behavior of Fe 3 + is defined as selective, reflecting its strong local ordering effects...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that alkali {{activated}} binders can achieve similar strengths to both ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and blended cements. However, to date little research has been undertaken on their durability properties. This study investigated the influence of activators concentration and <b>alkali</b> modulus on <b>strength,</b> sorptivity and carbonation of alkali activated slag (AAS) and fly ash (FA) based geopolymer concrete. The same tests were also conducted on blended concrete with 30 %, 50 %, and 70 % OPC replacement with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) along with control concrete. Results indicate that the alkali modulus has a major effect on sorptivity of both AAS and geopolymer, however no significant effects of the alkali modulus on carbonation was observed on AAS concrete. The phenolphthalein indicator gave no clear indication between carbonated and non-carbonated area in geopolymer specimens.

Extraction process was carried out with a constant ratio of seaweed weight to solvent volume (1 : 30; g/mL) at 100 oC in water bath equipped by shaker and at different time until the equilibrium was attained (60 minutes). The extract was then precipitated in 3 volume of 90 % ethanol, oven dried at 60 oC until constant weight. Based on experimental data, pure water was the most efficient solvent with regard to yield but certainly not gel <b>strength.</b> <b>Alkali</b> significantly influenced carrageenan yield and properties. Increasing the KOH concentration leads to carrageenan containing less sulfate content. The gel strength was improved as the increasing KOH concentration. Also, the sulfate content decreased with the increasing extraction time.

40|$|Clay aerogels {{are unique}} {{materials}} formed through the sublimation drying of aluminosilicate clay hydrogels. Aerogels {{have been an}} area of increased research interest {{in the past decade}} due to their very low density, high surface area/porosity, and very low thermal conductivity. Significant efforts have been made to increase the mechanical strength and moisture resistance of these materials through the incorporation of both organic polymers and fiber reinforcement. Aluminosilicates can also be alkali activated, producing a highly crosslinked 3 D network polymer with generally excellent mechanical strength and chemical resistance, but with high density. This work presents a preliminary investigation into the combination of aerogel production techniques with alkali activation, with the goal of producing a high <b>strength,</b> <b>alkali</b> activated aerogel. Metakaolin, dehydroxylated montmorillonite and S Type furnace slag were investigated as aluminosilicate sources.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of naphtha changes after its treatment over lnO, FezOa and binary mixtures of lnO-FezOa. An increase in olefinic and aromatic content is observed which is maximum over FezOa and least over lnO. In case of lnO-FezOa binary systems, it {{is proportional to}} FezOa content. This has been ascribed due to cracking and subsequent dehydrocyclisation of feed stock. Acidic surfaces and higher operating temperatures are more favourable for these reactions. Additions of alkali to the systems investigated suppressed cracking, dehydrocyclisation and carbon deposition to a very marked extent. Incorporation of iron oxide, as well as, <b>alkali</b> improved mechanical <b>strength</b> of lnO globules appreciably. Attrition loss of finished globules came down from 40 % for pure lnO to 1. 92 % for sample containing 10 % Fe 20 a. It improved further to 1. 04 % after incor-poration of 5 % alkali in it. However, both the ingredients had an adverse effect on its sulphur absorption capacity. At 1000 /hr space velocity, 1000 ppm H 2 S concentration in feed stream and 400 °C bed temperature, slippage of H 2 S occured after 52 % sulphiding of pure zinc oxide. Under similar conditions, H 2 S was detected in treated gas after 30. 2 and 22. 5 % sulphiding of samples containing 10 % Fe 20 a and 1070 Fe 20 a+ 57 o Na 2 COa respectively...|$|R

Wild collected (field populations) and laboratory cultured (22 °C, 100 μmolm− 2 s− 1, 35 %± 330 μmolN) material were compared. Pre-treatment with alkali reduced agar yields from both species {{but did not}} significantlys influence gel strength, gelling temperature and melting temperature. Yields, gel strengths, gelling temperatures and melting temperatures of agar extracted from wild and cultured material of both species were not significantly different. Agar yields of G. gracilis ranged from 41. 6 – 49. 1 % dry weight, without alkali pre-treatment, which was reduced to 11. 1 – 17. 7 % with <b>alkali</b> pre-treatment. Gel <b>strength</b> was between 427 – 507 gcm− 2, with ranges of agar melting and gelling temperatures of 82 ° – 89. 5 °C and 32 ° – 42. 3 °C respectively.

The plain cement pastes and waste modified pastes (with cements replacement for 10 % of additives), also pastes with the well-known pozzolana additive, microsilica (MS), were investigated. The studies of development of hardening structure by ultrasound wave velocity (UWV) measurement method, of change of mineral composition and physical-mechanical properties were carried out. Impact of additives is subject to both the own properties (chemical, mineral composition and fineness) of additive and of cement. FCC accelerates noticeably the development of initial structure of finer cement (PCR) only. Beyond 24 h development of structure in all FCC modified pastes is going somewhat slower, nevertheless, after 28 days their structure is already more compact than that of plain pastes. The strength properties are changing accordingly. The development of initial structure of CD modified PCR, and especially PCSN, pastes is going faster, PCN - almost does not change. Beyond 24 h compacting of structure of all CD modified pastes was slower. For the early strength of cements, the impact of CD was negligible, after 28 and 90 days the strength of CD modified PCR and PCN pastes was lower than that of plain pastes. In the case of PCSN, the slag is activated by <b>alkali</b> and the <b>strength</b> increased. CD additive, like MS and FCC, decreases the OH" concentration in the liquid phase of hydrating cement suspensions at the initial period (till 3 h), however further in the course of 28 days it was growing and became higher than that of plain cement suspensions.

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the improved performance of sugarcane bagasse fibers-polypropylene (PP) composites {{as a result}} of alkali treatment done on sugarcane bagasse as reinforcing fibers. Alkali solution of 10 NaOH with a temperature of 60 - 70 oC was used to soak the bagasse for 2 to 6 hours. Hot pressed samples were prepared from a mixture of sugarcane bagasse fibers and PP with fibers/PP weight ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75, and 30 / 70. Hot pressed samples using untreated bagasse fibers were also produced for a comparison. Tensile test was performed to all samples and the fracture surface from tensile test samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study how the presence of reinforcement in PP matrix and its alkali treatment influenced the strengthening and failure characteristics of the composites. The alkali treatment carried out resulted in a relevant increase of tensile strength of the composite to 229, 29 MPa at 20 / 80 fibers/PP weight ratio or an increase of 43 comparing to the composite samples which their fibers were untreated with <b>alkali.</b> The tensile <b>strength</b> of the composite with a 25 / 75 fibers/PP weight ratio increased to 290, 30 MPa and decreased to 214, 17 MPa as the fibers/PP weight ratio increased to 30 / 70. Microstructural study using SEM showed a different outlook on the fiber# 65533 s surface after alkali treatment which the treatment caused the elimination of the impurities, waxy materials, lignin as well as hemicellulose, which was responsible for an easy deformation of the cellular networks.

40|$|The Cretaceous Mont Saint-Hilaire complex (Quebec, Canada) {{comprises}} {{three major}} rock units that were emplaced {{in the following}} sequence: (I) gabbros; (II) diorites; (III) diverse partly agpaitic foid syenites. The major element compositions of the rock-forming minerals, age-corrected Nd and oxygen isotope data for mineral separates and trace element data of Fe-Mg silicates from the various lithologies imply a common source for all units. The distribution of the rare earth elements in clinopyroxene from the gabbros indicates an ocean island basalt type composition for the parental magma. Gabbros record temperatures of 1200 to 800 °C, variable silica activities between 0 · 7 and 0 · 3, and fO 2 values between − 0 · 5 and + 0 · 7 (log ΔFMQ, where FMQ is fayalite-magnetite-quartz). The diorites crystallized under uniform aSiO 2 (aSiO 2 [*]=[*] 0 · 4 - 0 · 5) and more reduced fO 2 conditions (log ΔFMQ ~ − 1) between ~ 1100 and ~ 800 °C. Phase equilibria in various foid syenites indicate that silica activities decrease from 0 · 6 - 0 · 3 at ~ 1000 °C to < 0 · 3 at ~ 550 °C. Release of an aqueous fluid during {{the transition to the}} hydrothermal stage caused aSiO 2 to drop to very low values, which results from reduced SiO 2 solubilities in aqueous fluids compared with silicate melts. During the hydrothermal stage, high water activities stabilized zeolite-group minerals. Fluid inclusions record a complex post-magmatic history, which includes trapping of an aqueous fluid that unmixed from the restitic foid syenitic magma. Cogenetic aqueous and carbonic fluid inclusions reflect heterogeneous trapping of coexisting immiscible external fluids in the latest evolutionary stage. The O and C isotope characteristics of fluid-inclusion hosted CO 2 and late-stage carbonates imply that the surrounding limestones were the source of the external fluids. The mineral-rich syenitic rocks at Mont Saint-Hilaire evolved as follows: first, <b>alkalis,</b> high field <b>strength</b> and large ion lithophile elements were pre-enriched in the (late) magmatic and subsequent hydrothermal stages; second, percolation of external fluids in equilibrium with the carbonate host-rocks and mixing processes with internal fluids as well as fluid-rock interaction governed dissolution of pre-existing minerals, element transport and precipitation of mineral assemblages determined by locally variable parameters. It is this hydrothermal interplay between internal and external fluids that is responsible for the mineral wealth found at Mont Saint-Hilair...|$|R
40|$|Membranes must {{be cleaned}} {{regularly}} to remove organic material deposited {{on the surface}} from the food or biological fluids processed. Cleaning is a compulsory step in maintaining the permeability and selectivity of the membrane and is also necessary to return the plant to its original capacity, to avoid bacteriological contamination, and to produce products with a long shelf-life. Without cleaning, the flux of solution through the membrane would decline to uneconomic levels. Caustic, acidic and enzymatic based cleaners {{may be used for}} membrane cleaning. Such cleaners affect the lifetime and performance of a membrane and should thus be surface-active, soluble, rinsable, non-corrosive, safe, effective and easy to use. The primary objective of work carried out was to evaluate a range of cleaning chemicals and cleaning regimes on a pilot-scale. Cleaning regimes employing conventional caustic and acidic cleaners, and enzymatic detergents have been evaluated for a Desal ultrafiltration membrane. The membrane was reproducibly fouled during the processing of skim milk and skim milk concentrate on a pilot-scale plant supplied by Tuchenhagen (N. Z.) Limited and compared favourably with an industrial plant. A spiral wound membrane of polyethersulfone with an active area of 7. 4 m and a 10, 000 molecular weight cut-off was selected. A transmembrane pressure of 2. 5 bar, a retentate flow rate of 60 %, a temperature of 18. 5 °C, and a recirculation flow rate of 7 m was kept constant during filtration. A combination of flux recovery after cleaning and solute resistance removal was used to assess cleaning performance. Higher flux recoveries (87. 3 - 93. 6 %) were achieved with surfactant based formulations compared with enzymatic detergents. This was attributed to the wetting action of surfactants which when used in conjunction with a high <b>strength</b> blended <b>alkali</b> solution, aided the convective cleaning solution flow through the membrane pores. Enzymatic cleaning was found to be milder to the membrane. While the enzyme-sanitiser regime yielded good flux recoveries (68. 4 - 87. 3 %), the enzyme-acid and acid-enzyme regimes were not capable of restoring membrane permeability, resulting in low flux recoveries 64. 2 - 78. 9 %. The acid in these regimes caused the membrane pores to shrink, restricting the ability of the enzymatic detergent or rinse water to penetrate the foulant and remove it. Based on these results, a new formulation (DR 292) with more surfactant action was developed and evaluated. Flux recovery using this new formulation increased by 3. 5 %. Regimes incorporating non-ionic surfactants and high <b>strength</b> <b>alkali</b> solutions were found to successfully restore membrane permeability because a higher level of surfactant was obtained from the mixture. Further experiments using enzyme-acid and acid-enzyme regimes, and the new formulation need to be trialed on new membranes to determine their long-term effect on membrane permeability and selectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} for the civil engineering community {{in the near future}} will be to realize the building of structures in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, through the use of high performance materials which have low environmental impact and can be produced at reasonable cost. Geopolymers are novel binder materials that could provide a route towards this objective. Although research on geopolymer has advanced, most of the previous research conducted on geopolymers has dealt with pastes and concentrated on the material's chemistry and microstructure. There is little information available concerning the engineering and durability properties of geopolymer concrete and none considering the use of natural pozzolans for production of geopolymer concrete. This investigation has studied the potential of using five natural pozzolans from Iran as geopolymer precursors. Most of the raw materials contain zeolites and clay minerals and have a high loss on ignition. Therefore, trials were made where samples were calcined at 700, 800 and 900 °C. The solubility of both the raw and calcined materials in an alkaline solution was used as an indicator for pozzolanic activity. Improvements in pozzolanic properties due to heat treatment and elevated curing temperatures (20, 40, 60, and 80 °C) were studied by using alkali solubility, XRD and compressive strength tests. It has been found that geopolymer binders can be synthesized by activating natural pozzolans and condensing them with sodium silicate in a highly alkaline environment. A new model is presented which allows the prediction of the <b>alkali</b> activated pozzolan <b>strength</b> from information on their crystallinity, chemical compositions and alkali solubility. Two types of Iranian natural pozzolans, namely Taftan which can be activated without calcination and Shahindej which was calcined were selected for further activation to study the effect of the alkaline medium on the strength of the alkali-activated natural pozzolan. The effect of the type, form, and concentration (molarities = 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 M) of the alkaline hydroxide, the modulus of sodium silicate (Si 02 INa 20 ratio = 2. 1, 2. 4, 3. 1) and different curing conditions on the geopolymerisation of the above two natural pozzolans were studied. The optimum range and contributions for each factor is suggested based on their effect on compressive strength. An optimum paste formulation has been developed for concrete mixing together with the procedure of addition of the raw materials to the reaction mixture and suitable curing methods for producing the geopolymer concrete derived from them. The properties of this geopolymer concrete in both the fresh and hardened states have been investigated in terms of setting time, workability, air content, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, static modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and drying shrinkage. Studies related to durability such as gas permeability, chloride ion penetration, and sulphate resistance have been undertaken and compared to these for typical OPC concretes. Some problems were encountered in applying the standard concrete durability tests. In this study {{attempts have been made to}} determine the relationships between the different properties of geopolymer concrete with its compressive strength and compared to results for ope concrete, to help to explain the differences between alkali-activated natural pozzolan concrete and ope concrete. In the countries which have large resources of natural pozzolan, geopolymer concrete based on alkali activation of these resources can help decrease the energy consumption and environmental impacts involved in using traditional cement pastes...|$|R
40|$|The large {{environmental}} footprint caused by conventional synthetic fibre reinforced petrochemical-derived polymer composites along with potential improvement in mechanical properties for natural fibre reinforced bio-derived polymer composites, {{have long been}} a motivation for further research and innovation in natural fibre composites. Harakeke and hemp fibres, amongst other natural fibres, possess respectable mechanical properties along with other advantages such as low cost, low production energy requirements and abundant availability. Polylactic acid (PLA), a sustainable alternative to petrochemical-derived polymers, is produced on a mass scale from 100 % renewable resources and can be degraded at end of life by simple hydrolysis under the appropriate conditions. It has high stiffness, strength, thermal and UV stability, but is low in toughness. Limited applications of natural fibre reinforced PLA composites so far is mainly due to low mechanical properties of discontinuous fibre composites made using injection moulding or compression moulding using randomly oriented fibre mats attributed to poor fibre orientation and fibre-matrix incompatibility. Presented {{in this study are}} experimental investigations of the properties of PLA reinforced aligned discontinuous harakeke and hemp fibre mats produced using a dynamic sheet former (DSF) to provide improved performance of discontinuous fibre composites. Harakeke and hemp fibres were treated using either a solution of 5 wt% or 10 wt% NaOH or combination of 5 wt% NaOH with 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 at elevated temperatures in a small pressure vessel. Treated fibres were assessed using single fibre tensile testing, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that 5 wt% NaOH/ 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 and 5 wt% NaOH effectively removed non-cellulosic materials from harakeke and hemp fibre surfaces, respectively, giving good fibre separation without greatly reducing the tensile strength of the fibres. It was also found that these treatments lead to a higher crystallinity index and improved thermal stability of fibres. Fibre alignment in fibre mats produced using a DSF was observed using light microscopy. Visual observation supported that the fibre alignment had occurred. Fibre orientation factors (Kɵ) determined for harakeke and hemp composites using the Bowyer-Bader model were found higher compared to Kɵ values obtained for other natural composites prepared using injection and compression moulding. Improved fibre orientation resulted in improved reinforcement giving large increases for tensile strengths up to approximately 90 and 60 % for harakeke and hemp composites reinforced with inclusion of 30 and 25 wt% fibre respectively. The effect of silane and peroxide as additional fibre treatments and MA-g-PLA as a coupling agent was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), composite swelling analysis, tensile testing, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron micrographs of fractured composite surfaces revealed that the gaps between fibres and matrix for composites with fibres treated using silane and peroxide and composites coupled with MA-g-PLA were smaller compared to the surfaces for composites with fibres treated using just <b>alkali.</b> Improved interfacial <b>strength</b> was also supported by lower swelling indices, lower peaks on tan δ and higher residual composites weights, compared to those values obtained for composites with fibres treated using just alkali, which was found to lead to higher composite tensile strengths. Harakeke and hemp fibre composites were plasticised using hyper-branched polymer (HBP) and assessed using SEM, tensile and impact testing. SEM micrographs for plasticised composites revealed longer pultruding fibres than un-plasticised composites, with gaps between the fibre and matrix appearing to be slightly larger, indicating a weaker interface between fibres and matrix compared to those composites without plasticiser. Improved composite ductility and impact strength were demonstrated for plasticised composites without dramatic reduction of composite tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|The UK is {{committed}} to reducing {{the environmental impact of}} construction, but due to growing population there is a requirement for new domestic housing. The embodied environmental impact is going to become an increasingly significant proportion of the whole life cycle of a building. There is therefore a requirement for research into low environmental impact construction materials. There has been a resurgence of earthen construction techniques as a response to growing environmental awareness and consideration. This has led to a renewed interest in earth construction and an increased use of earth within contemporary architecture. However, there are many barriers to the mainstream adoption of traditional methods of earthen construction, and only with the widespread adoption can the benefits be fully utilised. Extruded earth bricks that are manufactured using the well established fired brick production methods, without the firing can produce consistent, high quality, low cost bricks. As the bricks are of the same dimensions as current masonry there are fewer barriers to the adoption. This form factor, crucial for contemporary construction, relies on wall thicknesses of only 100 mm. It has been shown that extruded earth bricks have a suitable strength for typical domestic loading. However, there are concerns about structural use due to loss of strength under elevated moisture contents; representing the greatest barrier to adoption. Stabilisation is a method by which the soil properties can be changed to increase strength under saturated condition. This thesis aim is to develop suitable methods of stabilisation for extruded earth bricks, with a lower environmental impact than existing masonry units. The scope is limited to the extrusion process and the soil currently used for fired brick production. To this extent seven brick soils used in the manufacture of commercially fired bricks were investigated into their physiochemical properties and engineering properties with respect to the identified mineralogy. There has been limited literature focusing on extruded earth bricks which is in part due to the difficulties of specimen manufacture. Two methods of laboratory scale specimen production were investigated and compared to full scale unfired bricks. A small scale extruder was used to make one third linear scale bricks and was shown to be suitable representation for unstabilised conditions. This allowed for laboratory scale testing of extruded specimens. Three categories of chemical stabiliser were investigated including cement, lime and <b>alkali</b> hydroxides. Compressive <b>strength</b> development over 7, 14 and 28 days was determined for specimens tested in ambient conditions and following 24 hours fully submerged in water. Varying mass fractions and initial curing regimes were investigated to determine the effect on compressive strength. Only 5 % lime initially cured at 60 ◦C met the required structural criteria of a ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ compressive strength of 2. 9 and 1. 0 MPa respectively. Metakaolin was subsequently added as a secondary stabiliser to improve the strength for all the primary additives. The change in compressive strength was variable, but did enable a total of six specimens to meet the required criteria, all with 5 % lime as the primary stabiliser. A cradle-to-gate LCA was undertaken for the unstabilised and stabilised extruded earth bricks. The analysis only considered embodied energy and global warming potential and compared the results to conventional masonry units. Environmental criteria were developed based on the conventional masonry unit with the minimum impact. Considering this criteria, only two mixes were able to offer an improvement of the global warming potential. The reliance on highly processed commercial metakaolin was investigated by the partial thermal treatment of the brick soil. While the investigated chemical properties of this material were comparable to the metakaolin, the particle size distribution was significantly different. This resulted in a decrease in density, and no strength development when used with 5 % lime. This study has shown the potential for extruded earth masonry to be used structurally and the requirement for stabilisation. A possible stabilisation technique has been proposed which will allow for the reduction of the embodied global warming potential, whilst meeting the structural requirements...|$|R
