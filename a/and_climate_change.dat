40|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>change</b> has {{a number}} of observed, anticipated, or {{possible}} consequences on crop health worldwide. Global change, on the other hand, incorporates a number of drivers of change, including global population increase, natural resource evolution, and supply demand shifts in markets, from local to global. Global <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> interact in their effects on global ecosystems. Identifying and quantifying the impacts of global <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on plant diseases is complex. A number of nonlinear relationships, such as the injury (epidemic) damage (crop loss) relationship, are superimposed on the interplay among the three summits of the disease triangle (host, pathogen, environment). Work on a range of pathosystems involving rice, peanut, wheat, and coffee has shown the direct linkage and feedback between production situations and crop health. Global <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> influence the effects of system components on crop health. The combined effects of global <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on diseases vary from one pathosystem to another within the tetrahedron framework (humans, pathogens, crops, environment) where human beings, from individual farmers to consumers to entire societies, interact with hosts, pathogens, and the environment.

40|$|Water resources, {{which are}} {{considerably}} affected by land use/land cover (LULC) <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> {{are a key}} limiting factor in highly vulnerable ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions. The impacts of LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on water resources must be assessed in these areas. However, conflicting results regarding the effects of LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on runoff {{have been reported in}} relatively large basins, such as the Jinghe River basin (JRB), which is a typical catchment (>  45   000  km 2) located in a semi-humid and arid transition zone on the central Loess Plateau, northwest China. In this study, we focused on quantifying both the combined and isolated impacts of LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on surface runoff. We hypothesized that under climatic warming and drying conditions, LULC changes, which are primarily caused by intensive human activities such as the Grain for Green Program, will considerably alter runoff in the JRB. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was adopted to perform simulations. The simulated results indicated that although runoff increased very little between the 1970 s and the 2000 s due to the combined effects of LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> affected surface runoff differently in each decade, e. g., runoff increased with increased precipitation between the 1970 s and the 1980 s (precipitation contributed to 88  % of the runoff increase). Thereafter, runoff decreased and was increasingly influenced by LULC changes, which contributed to 44  % of the runoff changes between the 1980 s and 1990 s and 71  % of the runoff changes between the 1990 s and 2000 s. Our findings revealed that large-scale LULC under the Grain for Green Program has had an important effect on the hydrological cycle since the late 1990 s. Additionally, the conflicting findings regarding the effects of LULC <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> on runoff in relatively large basins are likely caused by uncertainties in hydrological simulations...|$|R
