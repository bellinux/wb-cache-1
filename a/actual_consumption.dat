25|$|The {{level of}} {{consumption}} {{is limited to}} 1m3 per day by a gauge installed on all residential connections. However, <b>actual</b> <b>consumption</b> is typically lower because of intermittent supply and low water pressure. The price of water per cubic meter obviously depends {{on the level of}} consumption, which varies and is not well known. Assuming an average-size household with 4.5 members that receives 100 liter per capita per day, the price of water is almost US$1/m3 in Beirut and US$0.66/m3 in the Bekaa. Tariffs in Lebanon thus are higher than in Jordan (US$0.65/m3 including sanitation) and much higher than in Syria or in Egypt (US$0.05/m3).|$|E

25|$|Given {{the high}} water {{scarcity}} in Jordan, the average per capita use {{is lower than}} in most other countries. Water production before network losses is about 120 liters per person and day while <b>actual</b> <b>consumption</b> is close to 80 liters per capita and day. A survey of water consumption habits by households in Eastern Amman and in 14 villages in the Northern Governorates showed that total consumption per capita lies between 60 and 80 liters per day. About 20-30% of this water is obtained from sources other than the public piped system, including from bottled water, water bought from tankers, rainwater harvesting and springs. In rural areas, 28% of households surveyed harvested rainwater and stored it in cisterns for drinking, since they considered it to be of better quality than piped water. In Eastern Amman, 12% of households bought water in large bottles and 30% bought water from private tankers. Most households have roof storage tanks with a volume of 1–2 m3. According to the 2009 Population and Family Health Survey, 31% of households use bottled water, 7% use rainwater, 2% tanker water and 60% tap water as their primary source of drinking water. According to the same survey, 22% of households filter tap water and the majority does not apply any type of treatment. A 2007–08 survey by the German-Jordanian water programme in the middle governorates Zarqa, Balqa and Madaba showed that 79% of households use tap water as their main source of drinking water and that 37% of households treat water before drinking it. Treated water bought in 5-gallon canisters and private water vendors that supply water in trucks are {{the main source of}} drinking water for 15% of households.|$|E

Average increase in number of tube wells for irrigation by many folds has raised the agricultural demand on the grid which is not being metered or monitored.

Hence this paper finds its importance while estimating actual electrical energy consumed by agricultural sector.

2500|$|Several {{theories}} {{on the nature}} of heat were developed. [...] In the 17th century, Johann Becher proposed that heat was associated with an undetectable material called phlogiston which was driven out of a substance when it was burnt. [...] This was finally refuted by Lavoisier demonstrating the importance of oxygen in burning in 1783. He proposed instead the caloric theory which saw heat as a type of weightless, invisible fluid that moved when out of equilibrium. This theory was used in 1824 by the French engineer Sadi Carnot when he published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire. [...] He set forth the importance of heat transfer: [...] "production of motive power is due not to an <b>actual</b> <b>consumption</b> of caloric, but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body, i.e. to its re-establishment of equilibrium." [...] According to Carnot, this principle applies to any machine set in motion by heat.|$|E

Results show that significant relations exist between perceived water <b>consumption</b> and <b>actual</b> water <b>consumption.</b> Participants have different perceptions of specific water-use patterns.
