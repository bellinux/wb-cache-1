40|$|ABSTRACT Germany {{is known}} as one of the {{countries}} where the collective representation of interests through associations (‘corporatism’) is particularly strong. However, after the tripartite <b>Alliance</b> <b>for</b> <b>Jobs,</b> Training and Competitiveness failed to agree on solutions for combating high unemployment, an independent commission estab-lished by the government (the ‘Hartz commission’) has currently set the agenda for labour market reform. This article addresses the question of whether these events signal the end of corporatism in labour market policy in Germany. An analysis of temporary agency work, an atypical form of employment addressed by the Hartz reforms, shows that funda-mental reform in Germany must be initiated outside the system of tripartite interest nego-tiation. However, the implementation of such reforms depends on the traditional structures of interest negotiation between the social partners...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{continental}} states have adopted tripartite concertation {{in order to}} reform their welfare and employment regimes. The German welfare state, in contrast, was highly resistant to reform efforts during the 1990 s. The article analyses the emergence of tripartite concertation in Germany. It presents two arguments. First, unlike many European countries, Germany encountered major economic problems only from the mid- 1990 s. Second, the German case illustrates the very complex nature of institutional barriers which restrict government intervention in policy fields. The examples of the <b>Alliances</b> <b>for</b> <b>Jobs</b> in 1995 and 1998 show the interaction between institutional barriers and reform policies...|$|R

50|$|Following his 1994 defeat, Jontz {{subsequently}} {{moved to}} Portland, Oregon, where {{he began working}} as Executive Director for the Western Ancient Forest Campaign. In 1999, Jontz helped organize the <b>Alliance</b> <b>for</b> Sustainable <b>Jobs</b> and the Environment (ASJE). While with WAFC, Jontz built an extremely effective grassroots organizing campaign, which pushed aggressively to protect forests, remove federal subsidies that financed clearcutting, and preserve {{millions of acres of}} previously unprotected roadless areas in National Forests. During his tenure with WAFC, he travelled extensively around the country forming relationships with state and local forest protection groups. As a result, Jontz was revered by forest activists throughout North America. In the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr., Jontz participated in acts of civil disobedience — including blocking a logging road in the Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon — to raise awareness about the plight of ancient forests. Those courageous acts were hailed by forest advocates as further proof that Jontz {{was one of the greatest}} leaders of the modern environmental movement. In 1998, Jontz was elected president of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). He was most recently the ADA president emeritus and served as a project coordinator for ADA's Working Families Win project.|$|R
