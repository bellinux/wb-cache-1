5|$|Clindamycin is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic {{produced by the}} actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents <b>and</b> <b>Chemotherapy</b> (ICAAC) in 1966. It {{has been on the}} market since 1968.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E

5|$|Stansfield was {{diagnosed}} with colorectal cancer in April 2010. He returned to training after surgery <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> but died on 10 August that year.

He has posthumously been featured on a Flybe airliner livery and tourist currency in Exeter.|$|E
5|$|The major {{end uses}} for {{germanium}} in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for fiber-optics, 30% infrared optics, 15% polymerization catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of Blum's pending major junior career, his family was beset with tragedy. A few months prior to his first {{training}} camp in Vancouver and a freshman at Trabuco Hills High School, his house caught fire from a gas leak on April 2, 2004, killing his twin sister, Ashley. Blum has two remaining half-siblings, an older brother and sister. The following year, during his rookie season in the WHL, his mother {{was diagnosed with a}} form of juvenile cancer. She underwent heart surgery <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> to overcome the cancer by May 2006.|$|E

5|$|Urine {{catecholamine}} level can be elevated in pre-clinical neuroblastoma. Screening asymptomatic infants {{at three}} weeks, six months, {{and one year}} has been performed in Japan, Canada, Austria and Germany since the 1980s. Japan began screening six-month-olds for neuroblastoma via analysis of the levels of homovanillic acid and vanilmandelic acid in 1984. Screening was halted in 2004 after studies in Canada and Germany showed no reduction in deaths due to neuroblastoma, but rather caused an increase in diagnoses that would have disappeared without treatment, subjecting those infants to unnecessary surgery <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was close}} to the {{influential}} German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. In 1879 Stokvis was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he served as vice-president of the Academy in 1896. He was awarded received an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Edinburgh in 1884. Stokvis also chaired the 1883 International Colonial Medicine Congress in Amsterdam. He was one of the founders (in 1896) of Janus, an international journal for the history of medicine. He is regarded as an illustrious member of Holland's medical dynasty, and as a pioneer in the fields of chemical physiology <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> Together with Samuel Siegmund Rosenstein, professor of medicine in Leiden, he was a supporter of Aletta Jacobs, the first woman to qualify as a doctor in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
25|$|The {{three basic}} types of {{treatment}} are surgery, radiation therapy, <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment usually {{involves}} surgery <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> and sometimes radiotherapy, {{regardless of the}} subtype of ovarian cancer. Surgical treatment may be sufficient for well-differentiated malignant tumors and confined to the ovary. Addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors confined to the ovary. For patients with advanced disease, a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard. Borderline tumors, even following spread outside of the ovary, are managed well with surgery, <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> is not seen as useful. Second-look surgery and maintenance chemotherapy have not been shown to provide benefit.|$|E

40|$|Improved {{survival}} of pediatric cancer patients {{will lead to}} an increase of late sequellae such as secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN).

Better understanding of these factors could improve patients management and could lead to the development of less toxic future therapies with the hope to decrease the risk of SMN. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{central nervous}} system {{lymphoma}} occurs most often in immunocompromised patients, in particular those with AIDS, but it can occur in the immunocompetent, as well.

25|$|Radiotherapy <b>and</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> {{are more}} {{commonly}} used in the metastatic form of RCC to target the secondary tumors in the bones, liver, brain and other organs.
