500|$|The Second World War saw {{a change}} in fortunes. Initially, {{children}} were evacuated to Eastbourne {{on the assumption that}} they would be safe from German bombs, but soon they had to be evacuated again because after the fall of France in June 1940 it was anticipated that the town would lie in an invasion zone. Part of Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion plan, envisaged landings at Eastbourne. Many people sought safety away from the coast <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> their houses. [...] Restrictions on visitors forced the closure of most hotels, and private boarding schools moved away. Many of these empty buildings were later taken over by the services. [...] The Royal Navy set up an underwater weapons school, and the Royal Air Force operated radar stations at Beachy Head and on the marshes near Pevensey. Thousands of Canadian soldiers were billeted in and around Eastbourne from July 1941 to the run-up to D-Day. The town suffered badly during the war, with many Victorian and Edwardian buildings damaged or destroyed by air raids. Indeed, {{by the end of the}} conflict it was designated by the Home Office to have been ‘the most raided town in the South East region’. The situation was especially bad between May 1942 and June 1943 with hit–and–run raids from fighter–bombers based in northern France.|$|E

2500|$|Cheney had {{met with}} Klein to discuss the American ban on Albertan beef that was in place {{following}} discovery of mad cow disease in a cow in Alberta in 2003. The cow was inspected, found to be substandard and removed {{so that it would}} not be fed to animals or humans. The carcass was processed into oils and the head sent to the United Kingdom where the case of mad cow was confirmed. Klein said, [...] "I guess any self-respecting rancher would have shot, shovelled <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up,</b> but he didn't do that," [...] referring to the farmer in northern Alberta whose animal was found to have the disease when it was taken to a slaughterhouse [...] Exports of Canadian beef cattle had already been stopped at the U.S. border, with other countries already following suit. Japan had been a key stumbling block to getting the U.S. border reopened because it made clear it might rethink taking U.S. beef if it had Canadian beef mixed in with it. Klein called on the federal government of Canada for support, citing the response to the Toronto SARS crisis in previous months.|$|E
