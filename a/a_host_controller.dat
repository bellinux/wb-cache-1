50|$|<b>A</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> {{interface}} (HCI) is a register-level interface {{that enables}} <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> for USB or IEEE 1394 hardware {{to communicate with}} <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> driver in software. The driver software is typically provided with an operating system of a personal computer, but may also be implemented by application-specific devices such as a microcontroller.|$|E
50|$|On the {{expansion}} card or motherboard controller, this involves much custom logic, with digital logic engines in the motherboard's controller chip, plus analog circuitry managing the high-speed differential signals. On the software side, {{it requires a}} device driver (called <b>a</b> <b>Host</b> <b>Controller</b> Driver, or HCD).|$|E
5000|$|... eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) is a {{computer}} interface specification that defines a register-level description of <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> for Universal Serial Bus (USB), which is capable of interfacing with USB 1.x, 2.0, and 3.x compatible devices.

5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, consisting of <b>a</b> <b>host,</b> <b>a</b> multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in}} the tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. <b>A</b> USB <b>host</b> may implement multiple <b>host</b> <b>controllers</b> and each <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to <b>a</b> single <b>host</b> <b>controller.</b> USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, and in {{conjunction}} with the i865 and i875 northbridges, the ICH5 was created. <b>A</b> SATA <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> was integrated. The ICH5R variant additionally supported RAID 0 on SATA ports. Eight USB-2.0 ports were available. The chip had full support for ACPI 2.0. It had 460 pins.|$|R
50|$|The {{control input}} to the device {{may be a}} signal that {{switches}} between {{the positive and negative}} supply voltages, withthe more positive voltage switching the device on and the more negative switching the device off. Other circuitsare designed to communicate through a serial port with <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> in order to set switches on or off.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} hardware, <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller,</b> host adapter, or host {{bus adapter}} (HBA) connects a computer, which {{acts as the}} host system, to other network and storage devices. The terms are primarily {{used to refer to}} devices for connecting SCSI, Fibre Channel and SATA devices. However, devices for connecting to IDE, Ethernet, FireWire, USB and other systems may also be called host adapters.|$|E
5000|$|Besides sensors, the Wiegand {{effect is}} used for {{security}} keycard door locks. [...] The plastic keycard has a series of short lengths of Wiegand wire embedded in it, which encodes the key by {{the presence or absence}} of wires. A second track of wires provides a clock track. The card is read by pulling it through a slot in a reader device, which has a fixed magnetic field and a sensor coil. As each length of wire passes through the magnetic field, its magnetic state flips, which indicates a 1, and this is sensed by the coil. The absence of a wire indicates a 0. The resulting Wiegand protocol digital code is then sent to <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> to determine whether to electrically unlock the door.|$|E
5000|$|Advanced <b>Host</b> <b>Controller</b> Interface (AHCI) is <b>an</b> open <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> {{interface}} {{published and}} used by Intel, {{which has become a}} de facto standard. It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as hotplug and native command queuing (NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in [...] "IDE emulation" [...] mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.|$|R

5000|$|The xHCI {{reduces the}} need for {{periodic}} device polling by allowing a USB 3.0 or later device to notify the <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> when it has data available to read, and moves the management of polling USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices that use interrupt transactions from the CPU-driven USB driver to the USB <b>host</b> <b>controller.</b> EHCI, OHCI, and UHCI <b>host</b> <b>controllers</b> would automatically handle polling for the CPU {{if there are no}} changes that need to be made and if no device has any interrupts to send but they all rely on the CPU to set the schedule up for the controllers. If any USB device using interrupt transactions does have data to send, then <b>an</b> xHCI <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> will send <b>an</b> interrupt to notify the CPU that there is a USB interrupt transaction that needs handling. Since the CPU no longer has to manage the polling of the USB bus, it can spend more time in low power states.|$|R

40|$|Semiconductor {{fabrication}} {{requires an}} increasingly expensive and integrated set of tightly controlled processes, driving {{the need for}} a fabrication facility with fully computerized, networked processing equipment. We describe an integrated, open system architecture enabling distributed experimentation and process control for plasma etching. The system was developed at MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories and employs in-situ CCD interferometry based analysis in the sensor-feedback control of an Applied Materials Precision 5000 Plasma Etcher (AME 5000). Our system supports accelerated, advanced research involving feedback control algorithms, and includes a distributed interface that utilizes the internet to make these fabrication capabilities available to remote users. The system architecture is both distributed and modular: specific implementation of any one task does not restrict the implementation of another. The low level architectural components include <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> that communicates with the AME 5000 equipment via SECS-II, and <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> for the acquisition and analysis of the CCD sensor images. A Cell Controller (CC) manages communications between these equipment and sensor controllers. The CC is also responsible for process control decisions; algorithmic controllers may be integrated locally or via remote communications. Finally, a System Server manages connections from internet/intranet (web) based clients and uses a direct link with the CC to access the system. Each component communicates via a predefined set of TCP/ IP socket based messages. This flexible architecture makes integration easier and more robust, and enables separate software components to run on the same or different computers independent of hardware or software platform...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{aimed to}} present the {{investigation}} of the use of photovoltaic cells based devices for solar light measurements and analysis in order to forecast the pace of growth of plants and to estimate the appropriate timing of harvest culture. It is based on the continuous data measurements by a microcontroller based circuitry of a solar module used for supplying a multi-functional wireless sensor for agriculture. The solar module consists of two monocrystalline solar cells (c-Si) flat design, highly transparent and having UV stable front encapsulation. The data is not only a simple day and night information, but a measurement of the solar radiation. The device is able to measure the environment temperature as well, therefore the data is useful for evaluation of the photoperiodism, but the correlation between solar radiation and temperature is also possible. The data is transmitted to <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> able to store and process higher volume information.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of the servo system {{is dependent on the}} speed or band width of the closed loop control system. To achieve the high speed closed loop operation, hardware oriented control is preferred and it is achieved by means of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip). The servo system is used to drive a two axis robotic arm moving in a plane where two PMSM motor with servo control provides the required motion. Robotic applications require quick and accurate changes in driving torque so that the required motion behaviour is attained. Quick change in operating flux is required for fast and accurate servo control. Conventional scalar control drives cannot achieve quick response time and hence vector control is employed. The IRMCK 201 ASIC used in the application has the Vector Control algorithm hard wired into it for complete servo control of a single PMSM. It takes the position and current feed back by using shaft encoder, hall sensor and IR 2175 Current sensing IC. It can set up communication with <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>controller</b> through either high speed serial, SPI or Parallel protocols.
