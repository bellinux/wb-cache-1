Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair.

25|$|In the end, West's anti-Communism {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of}} her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes {{of the status quo}} in capitalist countries.
