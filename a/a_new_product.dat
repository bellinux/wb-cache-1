The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E

Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.|$|E

25|$|Recyclate is a raw {{material}} that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which {{will be used to}} form new products.

25|$|Both minimum {{recycled}} content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify {{that a certain}} percentage of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.|$|E

In July 2014, MediaTek announced <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> targeting the high-end, with a feature set largely similar to the MT6595, but instead of a heterogeneous multi-processing architecture, the MT6795 features eight symmetrical 64-bit Cortex-A53 cores in a true octa-core configuration.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the car was}} {{designed}} for a Wankel rotary engine. In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankels for cars and Jeep-type vehicles. (The agreement also permitted Curtiss-Wright to sell rotaries elsewhere.) Later, AMC decided instead to purchase the engines from General Motors (GM), who were developing them for use in their own cars. However, GM canceled development in 1974 for reasons that included durability issues, the fuel crisis, tooling costs (for the engines and also for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> line designed {{to take advantage of}} the rotary's ultra-compact dimensions) and the upcoming (late 1970s) U.S. emissions legislation. It was also thought that the high-revving Wankel would not suit Americans accustomed to low revs and high torque.|$|E

25|$|The Coca-Cola Company also {{produces}} {{a number of}} other soft drinks including Fanta (introduced circa 1941) and Sprite. Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> for the German market, made from products only available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta. The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in plastic bottles or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.|$|E
25|$|Procter & Gamble {{acquired}} {{a number of}} other companies that diversified its product line and significantly increased profits. These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, the Iams Company, and Pantene, among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from levered positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks.|$|E
25|$|The system's launch {{represented}} {{not only}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> {{but also a}} reframing of the severely damaged home video game market. The video game market crash of 1983 had occurred in large part {{due to a lack}} of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had been partially due to confusion and misrepresentation in video game marketing. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. In stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined.|$|E
40|$|Does {{the first}} entrant in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> market have <b>a</b> {{difficult}} time surviving or do first-mover advantages provide protection from outright failure? Our empirical study of 264 new industrial product-markets yields insights into this controversial research topic. The key data analysis insights arise by comparing survival risks in markets that were started with <b>a</b> really <b>new</b> <b>product</b> versus <b>an</b> incremental innovation. When the pioneer starts <b>a</b> <b>new</b> market with <b>a</b> really <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> {{it can be}} a major challenge just to survive. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, market pioneer survival risks are much lower. Interestingly, early followers have the same survival risk across both types of markets. Overall, these results indicate that in markets started by <b>a</b> really <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> the first to market is often the first to fail. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, it appears that first-mover advantages protect the pioneer from outright failure. ...|$|R
