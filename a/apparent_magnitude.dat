5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> (m) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of −1.44, {{but it has}} an absolute magnitude of +1.41.|$|E
5|$|The <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means}} {{that it is not}} visible to the naked eye. It is {{slightly}} dimmer than Neptune, which has an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.49. The companion has an <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined <b>apparent</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System.
