40|$|Inorganic fibres {{especially}} asbestos {{have been}} widely used as a raw material in the construction industries. However, asbestos is now recognised as a carcinogenic material. Therefore, asbestos removal is being widely undertaken. But the hazards increase at this stage as the material is disturbed. Dry removal was found to be an <b>exhausting</b> <b>operation</b> producing a high concentration of fibres. The spraying or injection of wetting agent into the material reduces the hazard associated with the removal process by aggregating the fibres together. The airborne concentration of fibres is then considerably reduced. Raman microspectroscopy {{has been shown to be}} a very powerful technique for the identification of micrometer-sized fibres and particles, with little or no sample preparation. Such spectra are sensitive to the composition of the material and can often be used to distinguish between similar species. Raman microscopy also provides important information about surface coverage of such materials with a spatial resolution between 2 and 4 um. Raman spectra were obtained from five asbestos reference standards in comparison with four non-fibrous analogues. The different species such as amosite, anthophyllite, chrysotile, crocidolite and tremolite gave distinct spectra. There were no very distinct differences between the spectra of asbestos fibres and their non-fibrous forms except sometimes in the v(OH) stretching region or band width in the case of tremolite. The reference spectra have been used for identification of known and unknown (industrial samples) fibres on cellulose filters. Moreover, other inorganic particles on cellulose filters have been identified. The discrimination between pure diesel and coal particles on quartz filters and the identification of gunshot residues on paper substrates were also successfully achieved. The coverage of wetting agents on the surface of inorganic fibres connected with asbestos removal operations have been also investigated. Basic laboratory experiments were undertaken. Several inorganic fibres such as man made and asbestos fibres as well as calcium silicate were wetted using different processes: spraying, dipping and capillary adsorption in order to measure the distribution of wetting agents on individual fibres. Insulation materials, usually composed of calcium silicate and asbestos fibres from asbestos removal sites, were collected and also analysed by Raman microspectroscopy.

The first is the increasing depth of cover of coal mining operations due to shallow resources being <b>exhausted.</b> Some <b>operations</b> overseas have been operated at an overburden of more than 1300 meters. The second feature is the intensified production concentration associated with the greatly improved advancing rate of longwall faces； a single face output has reached more than 10 million tonnes per annum. Deep operations are exposed to a high ground stress regime, high gas content, and coal and gas outburst risk. These issues cause changes in mine design, including {{but not limited to}} high demand for stone roadways， which are more stable than coal ones under high ground stress conditions. Stone gate roads are needed to accommodate cross measure drilling to protect coal gate drivage from the risk of high gas emissions and outburst hazards. Increasing longwall face advancing rate shortens the lifespan of panels. Further, it necessitates short longwall development time to achieve smooth panel succession. Improved coal gate development and stone gate development are essential to fulfil this requirement. A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of tunnel construction machinery which integrates the functions of excavation, ground support, mucking, lining， and surveying.

40|$|The {{success of}} a Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process for solid fossil fuel {{combustion}} is critically affected by {{the performance of the}} oxygen carrier and by proper design and operation of the fuel reactor. In this study, a novel configuration of the fuel reactor for chemical looping combustion with oxygen uncoupling of solid fossil fuels is proposed. The configuration is based on a two-stage reactor with the aim of overcoming the main drawbacks of the single-stage design: limited conversion, slip of unburnt volatiles, extensive elutriation of char fines. The two stages of the configuration operate in series and accomplish different tasks. The bottom bed is mainly devoted to conversion of the char, taking advantage of the full oxidative power of the oxygen carrier coming from the air reactor. The top reactor exploits the residual oxidative power of the oxygen carrier to oxidize volatile matter and gasification products as well as the unconverted char issuing from the bottom bed. A mathematical model has been developed with the aim of assessing the performances of the two-stage fuel reactor varying operating conditions in comparison with a benchmark case consisting of a single-stage fuel reactor. Two options were considered in the benchmark, depending on whether the single stage fuel reactor is or is not equipped with a carbon stripper at the <b>exhaust.</b> The <b>operation</b> of the fuel reactor has been simulated by considering chemical looping combustion of a bituminous coal with an oxygen carrier consisting of CuO supported on zirconia...|$|R

40|$|When {{measuring}} {{emissions of}} gases, particulate, and odor from animal buildings, the ventilation data are equally {{important as the}} concentration data, because emission rate of a pollutant {{is the product of}} its concentration and the ventilation rate. However, effectively measuring and monitoring building ventilation remains a technical challenge, especially in barns with numerous fans. Although several measurement and monitoring techniques have been used in livestock barn studies, they are either relatively expensive or unreliable. A new technique was introduced for continuously monitoring <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>operation</b> in real-time by detecting the vibration of its housing or frame member. A low-cost vibration sensor, a 2 -coductor cable, a signal filter, and a digital input channel are used for each fan. A laboratory test was conducted to evaluate the technical viability of using the sensor in continuous vibration conditions. A 4 -month field test in layer barns was conducted to test the accuracy and life of three vibration sensors, which were installed on the fan housings and cones. The fan operation data was logged by a computer every minute. Coupled with simultaneous building static pressure measurement, the continuous ventilation rate can be calculated by using the fan airflow vs. pressure performance curve. The advantages of this technique include low cost (only about 1 % to 10 % of the cost of other tested techniques), simplicity, no interference by wind and dust, and the capability of directly monitoring individual fans to avoid false signals caused by fan failure, fan management changes or other problems.
