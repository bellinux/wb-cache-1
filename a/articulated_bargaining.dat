30|$|In {{discussing}} multi-level bargaining, Visser {{sees the}} key distinguishing characteristic {{to be one}} of articulation, which is defined as the extent to which additional bargaining on pay is under control of the union, and regulated and defined by the sectoral (or central) agreement and subject to a peace clause. So the critical issue here is said to be governance capacity. Two-tier systems are seen as operating within Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. (Single-level multi-employer bargaining models, where as a rule no local bargains are assumed to obtain, include Austria, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.) Again, {{on the basis of a}} ranking exercise, Visser’s conclusion with regard to systems with a systematic second bargaining round—the so-called institutionalized two-tier bargaining—is that while multi-level bargaining has increased over time, fully <b>articulated</b> <b>bargaining</b> is rare. The contemporary poorly articulated counterparts of Britain and Italy in the 1970 s and 1980 s are identified as Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Spain.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the challenge}} of variable pay to collective bargaining, based on a cross-national comparison that takes banking organizations in Austria, Norway, Spain and the UK as representatives of Europe's principal bargaining systems. The hypothesis is that the capacity of collective bargaining to govern variable pay varies with the bargaining system. As the findings show, <b>articulated</b> multi-employer <b>bargaining</b> is more able to govern variable pay than its unarticulated counterpart and single-employer bargaining. Within the case of <b>articulated</b> multi-employer <b>bargaining,</b> single-channel systems of employee workplace representation are superior to dual systems, all the more since the former equip the unions with selective incentives for membership. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between trade unions {{and the environment}} {{is widely regarded as}} tense and difficult, yet in recent years the environment has become an important new campaigning issue for UK trade unions. Historically, union antagonism towards the environment has been exaggerated but the relationship was not close. UK unions have supported environmental initiatives since the 1970 s, although these have been inconsistently implemented. Ideological and class-based differences between the trade union and environmental movements exist, but have been overstated, while the political opportunity structure was not conducive to cooperation between unions and environmental groups until the 1990 s. Union decline followed by modernisation in the 1990 s altered the labour- environmentalist relationship by changing the content and conduct of trade unionism and employee relations alike; creating new spaces within which more diverse union memberships could <b>articulate</b> novel <b>bargaining</b> and organising agendas (within a revised approach to employee relations) and enhancing unions’ porosity to social dialogue in order to facilitate their rehabilitation to the UK’s social, political and economic policymaking arenas. Union environmental policies and activism reveal the influence of both membership interests and ideology and unions’ search for practical applications for a nascent green (bargaining) agenda. Nevertheless, although the TUC has identified the environment as a strategic concern, relatively few of its members are consistently implementing a green agenda, despite evidence that it is popular with both members and activists. Unions’ contemporary environmental activism appears largely unrelated to union size, membership trend or finances and relatively immune to sectoral and employee relations specificities. Union headquarters’ support {{for the development of a}} unionised green function and pro-environmental attitudes are, however, important. Unions remain to be convinced of the agenda’s efficacy as a vehicle for recruiting new members and activists, but more optimistic regarding its ability to enhance their influence with employers. However, case study evidence suggests that a technocentric and conservative workplace greening agenda has limited use either as a recruitment tool or as a vehicle to promote collectivism and its ability to recruit new activists merely reflects extant branch capabilities. Further, although workplace greening is associated with favourable environmental policy and policymaking outcomes and processes it does not appear to generate any pro-union shift in relative bargaining power. ...|$|R
40|$|B. C. Health Services {{represents}} {{a revolution in}} the Supreme Court’s thinking about section 2 (d). The Court has done more than reject the conclusion in its earlier cases that collective bargaining does not enjoy Charter protection. Rather, the jurisprudential underpinning for the Court’s approach to section 2 (d) has been dismantled on the ground that it was too “decontextualized”. This {{represents a}} departure from a “neutral” approach to section 2 (d) that refrains from privileging some associations over others. Contrary to the Court’s assertions in B. C. Health Services, the neutral approach was grounded in the purposes and values underlying the guarantee of freedom of association. The writer submits that the new “contextualized” approach — under which the Court recites a variety of contingent factors that, it claims, favour the constitutional protection of collective bargaining —appears to be no more than a licence to the judiciary, under the rubric of protecting freedom of association, to grant constitutional protection to particular activities or objects pursued in concert by particular groups. The result is an approach to section 2 (d) that looks not to the values underlying the constitutional protection of associating itself, but instead to the judiciary’s value judgments about the particular activities, objects or groups for which Charter protection is sought. Quite apart from raising issues of legitimacy, the substitution of a context-driven analysis in place of a principled the ory of section 2 (d) leads to considerable legal uncertainty. The practical implications of B. C. Health Services are no less troubling. of particular concern is the elevation of actual and potential collective agreements to constitutional status, with the result that privately negotiated deals, and even unexpressed negotiating intentions, can trump the expression of public policy through legislation. Neither the Court’s reliance on a process/substance distinction in <b>articulating</b> the collective <b>bargaining</b> right, nor its approach to section 1, adequately addresses this concern...|$|R
