Their fruit is sent by the eunuchs as presents to the Sultan and the great men of Al-Islam; it is highly valued by the vulgar, but the Olema do not think much of its claims to importance. Among the palms are the venerable remains of a Sidr, or Lote tree,[FN#77] whose produce is sold for inordinate sums. The enclosure is entered by a dwarf gate in the South-Eastern portion of the railing, near the well, {{and one of the}} eunuchs is generally to be seen in it: it is under the charge of the Mudir, or chief treasurer. These gardens are not uncommon in Mosques, as the traveller who passes through Cairo can convince himself. They form a pretty and an <b>appropriate</b> <b>feature</b> in a building erected for the worship of Him [...] "Who spread the Earth with Carpets of Flowers and drew shady Trees from the dead Ground."

Thus far, objects which have good edge features or blob features have been successfully recognized; for example detection algorithms, see Harris affine region detector and SIFT, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a {{difficult}} task. It needs different approaches and tools to get a set of images similar to a complex query image. Finding <b>appropriate</b> <b>features</b> {{is one of the}} important issues in this process. There are several tools to extract the <b>appropriate</b> <b>features</b> from the images. In this paper we explore the usage of 1 -D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as a tool for finding features of the boundary of objects in the query and database images. It is shown that the sensitivity of the DCT to rotation of objects can be reduced and the 1 -D DCT of extended boundary signals can even give better results than the DFT in shape retrieval process.

Image features generated from the vicinity of these points are then clustered using k-means or another appropriate algorithm. In this process of vector quantization, one can think of the centroids of these clusters as being representative of the appearance of distinctive object parts. <b>Appropriate</b> <b>feature</b> detectors are then trained using these clusters, {{which can be used}} to obtain a set of candidate parts from images.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{weighted}} supervised pooling method for visual recognition systems. We combine a standard Spatial Pyramid Representation which is commonly adopted to encode spatial information, with an <b>appropriate</b> <b>Feature</b> Space Representation favoring semantic information in an <b>appropriate</b> <b>feature</b> space. For the latter, we propose a weighted pooling strategy exploiting data supervision to weigh each local descriptor coherently with its likelihood to belong to a given object class. The two representations are then combined adaptively with Multiple Kernel Learning. Experiments on common benchmarks (Caltech- 256 and PASCAL VOC- 2007) show that our image representation improves the current visual recognition pipeline and it is competitive with similar state-of-art pooling methods. We also evaluate our method on a real Human-Robot Interaction setting, where the pure Spatial Pyramid Representation does not provide sufficient discriminative power, obtaining a remarkable improvemen...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{recognition of}} online handwritten text {{has been an}} on-going research problem for nearly four decades. It has been gaining more interest due to the increasing popularity of hand-held computers, digital notebooks and advanced cellular phones. However for these input modalities to be economical and user friendly the recognition rate should be very high for real time use. Also, {{the large number of}} writing styles and the variability between them makes the handwriting recognition problem a very challenging area for researchers. Many researchers have proposed a number of novel techniques for online handwriting recognition.

Although {{there are many}} feature selection algorithms {{have been used in}} identifying <b>appropriate</b> <b>features</b> for dendrite cell signals, there are algorithms that never been investigated and limited work to compare performance among them. In this study, six feature selection algorithms namely Information Gain, Gain Ratio, Symmetrical Uncertainties, Chi Square, Support Vector Machine, and Rough Set with Genetic Algorithm Reduct are examined and their effectiveness to represent dendrite cell signal are evaluated. Eight universal datasets are chosen and assessing their performance according to sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. From the experiment, the Rough Set Genetic Algorithm reduct is found to be the most effect feature selection for dendrite cell algorithm when it generates a consistent result for all evaluation metrics. In single evaluation metrics, the chi square technique has the best competence in term of sensitiveness while the rough set genetic algorithm reduct is good at specificity and accuracy.
