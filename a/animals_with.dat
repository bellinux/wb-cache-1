5|$|Toy <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> wheels {{dating from}} the Pre-Columbian era were {{uncovered}} by archaeologists in Veracruz, Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 <b>animals,</b> <b>with</b> male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{distinguished}} about 500 {{species of}} birds, mammals and fishes in History of Animals and Parts of Animals. His system of classification, {{one of the}} earliest in scientific taxonomy, was influential for over two thousand years.

5|$|Buffon {{attached}} much {{importance to}} the illustrations; Jacques de Sève illustrated the quadrupeds and François-Nicolas Martinet illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> care given both to aesthetics and anatomical accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> long {{hind legs}} and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Cott {{describes}} simple experiments such as {{that fish}} that have changed colour to match a pale background survived better (64% to 42%) on such a background than fish which had not. He also quotes some anecdotal observations on wild <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> similar but not quantified results.|$|E

5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest kosher meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts <b>animals,</b> <b>with</b> verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, {{several hundred}} zoo {{visitors}} {{were forced to}} seek shelter after a family of red river hogs escaped from keepers and ran amok. Those who had taken refuge in the monkey house later described scenes where zoo workers pursued the <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> various equipment including brushes and dart guns. Though the drama lasted over an hour, the adult hogs were recaptured unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Most studies {{consider}} dinosaurs as endothermic (warm-blooded) <b>animals,</b> <b>with</b> {{an elevated}} metabolism {{comparable to that}} of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the aerobic endurance of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would have exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns further enlivened the {{academic}} regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce {{performed by the}} students (including André Messager).

5|$|Small {{groups of}} <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> little {{opportunity}} for exchange between them face {{the risk of}} inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.|$|E

50|$|Up until now, {{scientists}} {{assumed that}} the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates was a shark-like <b>animal,</b> <b>with</b> no distinct jawbones, and that modern jaws evolved in early bony fishes. This discovery shows that modern jaws evolved earlier. It is possible that Chondrichthyes started with distinct jaws and then dispensed with them. This {{has been called the}} earliest known <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> what looks like a face.|$|R
