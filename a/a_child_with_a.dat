After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the addiction is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> condition that would have required the amputation of her left arm and leg.|$|E

5|$|Rumours that Prince Albert Victor {{may have}} committed, or been {{responsible}} for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in , that Albert Victor fathered <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{woman in the}} Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders {{in an effort to}} cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence. For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was over 500miles (over 800km) away at Balmoral, the royal retreat in Scotland, in the presence of Queen Victoria, other family members, visiting German royalty and a large number of staff. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.|$|E

40|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{a serious}} and {{life-threatening}} mental health issue which needs to be given more attention. Qualitative research on parents’ experience in caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder is lacking around the world, and is almost non-existent in New Zealand. Parents of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder have a huge and difficult role in caring for their child. Resources and facilities for treating eating disorders {{around the world are}} limited, and support for carers is minimal, which means the distressing experience of caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder can become more difficult to manage. By giving parents in New Zealand an opportunity to voice their experiences, others may be educated about anorexia nervosa and the experiences of parents. A qualitative approach was employed in this project to explore the experiences of parents in caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder. Twelve parents of nine daughters suffering from anorexia nervosa consented to participate in this research and were interviewed. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using phenomenological approaches. Descriptive, interpretative and hermeneutic phenomenological methods were drawn on to provide a detailed and in-depth explanation of what it is like for a parent to care for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder. Analysis revealed that the parents experienced three stages during the struggle for the salvation of their child, which I have labeled the insidious stage, the tenacious stage and the recovery stage. Across the stages it was apparent that the battle against the eating disorder was never-ending, and full of uncertainty, contradiction and emotion. So coping was essential for the physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted parents. The findings from this research can help raise awareness in society, assist in nationwide education around eating disorders and contribute to improving parents’ experiences of caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder. This research has established a good foundation for understanding the experiences of New Zealand parents, regarding {{what it is like to}} care for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder...|$|R

40|$|Background: This thesis {{explored}} men’s {{experiences of}} becoming <b>a</b> father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability {{in the early}} years. In Ireland, {{it is estimated that}} there are almost 97 % (n= 9, 914) <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities living at home in the care of parents, siblings, relatives or foster parents. While mothers and fathers are the primary caregivers, mothers’ experiences are well documented in comparison to the dearth of reports on fathers’ experiences. This descriptive narrative study aims to redress this gap in knowledge and understanding of men’s experiences of becoming <b>a</b> father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability in the early years. Method: Narrative inquiry was employed for this study as it allows stories told by fathers to be collected as a means of exploring men’s transition to becoming <b>a</b> father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. A sample of 10 fathers of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities aged between thirteen months and five years of age were recruited from a large intellectual disability Health Service Provider (HSP) in the South of Ireland. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews which were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using a narrative thematic approach. Findings: Findings are presented in four themes: i) ‘becoming a father’, ii) ‘something wrong with my child’, iii) ‘entering the world of disability’ and iv) ‘living a different life’. For all 10 fathers the time of being told that their <b>child</b> had <b>an</b> intellectual disability was laden with negative emotional responses irrespective of whether the diagnosis was at birth or more gradual over the child’s early developmental period. When fathers found out that ‘something was wrong’ they spoke of ‘moving on’ and entering the world of disability. In their narratives, becoming the father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability had changed their lives and would inevitably change their futures. Fathers’ positivity was clearly evident with many fathers identifying that the diagnosis of their <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability was not a life ending event but rather a life changing event. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals have a critical role in supporting fathers during the transition to becoming <b>a</b> father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. Factors which require consideration include recognising that each father’s experience is unique; that fathers require support; and that fathers achieve personal growth because of their experiences of their transition to becoming <b>a</b> father of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability in the early years...|$|R

25|$|Chromosomal aberrations are {{disruptions}} in {{the normal}} chromosomal content of a cell and are {{a major cause of}} genetic conditions in humans, such as Down syndrome, although most aberrations have little to no effect. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as translocations, or chromosomal inversions, although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chromosome disorder.

25|$|Just as in adults, most {{headaches}} are benign, {{but when}} head pain is accompanied with other {{symptoms such as}} speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended.

25|$|While folate is most {{well known}} for {{preventing}} neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Both choline and folate (with the help of vitamin B12) can act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can {{then go on to}} form SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary choline deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and choline are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production. Inhibition of choline absorption and use is associated with neural-tube defects in mice, and this may also occur in humans. A retrospective case control study (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily choline intake had a four-fold greater risk of having <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> neural-tube defect than women in the highest quartile of intake.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 Spielrein {{married the}} Russian Jewish {{physician}} Pavel Nahumovitch Sheftel. They moved to Berlin, where Spielrein worked alongside Karl Abraham. Spielrein {{had her first}} daughter Irma-Renata (known as Renata), in 1913. While in Berlin, Spielrein published nine further papers. One of these was an account of children’s beliefs about sex and reproduction, in which she included recollections of her own early fantasies about this. Entitled 'Contribution to the Understanding of a Child's Soul', it shows her in more Freudian mode than her previous papers. In another paper, entitled, ‘The Mother-in-Law’, she gave a sympathetic account {{of the role of}} mothers-in-law and the relationship between them, their daughters-in-law. The Dutch psychoanalyst van Waning has commented on this paper: ”Women’s studies – in the year 1913!”. Another paper from the time recounts her treatment of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> phobia of animals, {{and is one of the}} first known reports of child psychotherapy At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Switzerland, living briefly in Zurich again before relocating to Lausanne, where she and Renate remained for the rest of the war. Her husband joined his regiment in Kiev, and they were not reunited for more than a decade. The war years were times of privation for Spielrein: she did some work as a surgeon and in an eye clinic, but also received contributions from her parents when they could get these to her. She did however manage to publish two more short papers during the war years. She composed music, and considered becoming a composer. She also began to write a novel in French. She recorded observations of her daughter's development in terms of language and play. She continued her correspondence with Freud and Jung, and to evolve her own theoretical ideas, particularly in relation to attachment in children.|$|E

Another motivating factor is the paucity of research in this area. A qualitative research approach was chosen for this study as the researcher believed this was the best method to learn of the personal and unique experiences of families. A purposeful sampling technique was used and ten parents participated in the study, all of whom have <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Intellectual Disability and who avail of respite care services. The sample consisted of nine mothers and one father. A semi-structured interview was conducted with each parent and the data was analysed using thematic analysis. This study found that parents viewed the care of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Intellectual Disability as both demanding and rewarding. The parents experienced stress and felt they were isolated in their caring role. Parents were concerned what the impact of caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Intellectual Disability would have on their other siblings, in terms of care and the responsibilities placed on them. On the other hand, parents described the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> the Intellectual Disability as the life and soul of the family that they would not want this to change. Other findings from the study indicated that parents didn’t receive enough respite care for their child and also that the care they received didn’t occur when most needed but it was offered as it became available from the service provider. Another finding from the study was that parents were totally unaware of what actually occurred during the time their child was in respite care. The parents were also unaware of the qualifications of the staff offering this service. The parents also stressed that they were worried about future care needs for their Intellectually Disabled child. However, despite this worry only one parent was actively researching possible future care facilities. This was a small piece of research that highlights the demands on parents of caring for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Intellectual Disability and the shortfalls in respite service delivery. The research points to the need for more collaboration between service providers and service users. It also highlights supports these parents identified as important to them...|$|R
