500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E
2500|$|Historian of {{religion}} Cameron Wybrow wrote {{a review of}} Edge of Evolution published in The Philadelphia Inquirer, stating that the book [...] "provides some hard numbers, coupled with an ingenious argument". Additionally a review in The Christian Post by minister Chuck Colson recommends it, noting [...] "Even {{if you do not}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> in it, as I do not, you do not need to follow the Darwinist line that everything you disagree with must be squashed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hannity {{promoted}} the falsehood that the Affordable Care Act would create so-called [...] "death panels". According {{to a study}} by Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Hannity's show, along with the Laura Ingraham Show, were the first major conservative media personalities to latch onto the false claim of Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, that the Affordable Care Act contained death panels. When Sarah Palin stirred controversy by promoting the death panels myth, and argued her case in a Facebook post, Hannity defended her and said, [...] "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> that she wrote". Hannity also claimed that he found the specific pages in the Affordable Care Act containing provisions on death panels.|$|E

2500|$|Lowe {{also noted}} that the name of Bishop Younan, the only {{recognized}} church leader on the document drafting team, was silently removed from the list of authors on the kairospalestine website. According to Lowe, Younan “asked to have it removed, {{so as not to be}} compromised by it.” Younan did not want to endanger his relationships “with Jewish religious figures and Israeli officials,” according to Lowe. [...] “Reportedly,” Lowe added, “he now assures anyone who asks that he does not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> in the document and that he is committed only to the statement of the Heads of Churches, where his name occurs near the bottom of the list.” Lowe additionally observed that Michel Sabbah, another signatory, had “retired as Latin Patriarch early in 2008, so he spoke only for himself and not for the Latin Patriarchate.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In Verona, Petruchio {{begins the}} [...] "taming" [...] {{of his new}} wife. She is refused food and {{clothing}} because nothing – according to Petruchio – {{is good enough for}} her; he claims perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything she says, forcing her to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims [...] "if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me" [...] (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman, and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her he is a man.|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I think it means something different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E

50|$|LaForest <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> Dickson found {{except for}} his {{interpretation}} of section 1.

And I thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that. If he {{had been talking about}} another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did.|$|E
60|$|There {{had been}} trouble at the Board Meeting, and, {{now that it}} was almost over, the {{directors}} of the Grenfell Consolidated sat in dejected silence, listening to the animadversions of one of their comrades. They did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> he said, but it scarcely seemed worth while to raise minor objections, for they were willing to admit that the situation was desperate.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{father came}} to see her {{as soon as he}} thought it best after Atherton's letter; and the old man had to endure talk of Bartley to which all her former praises were as {{refreshing}} shadows of defamation. She required him to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> she said, and he could not refuse; she reproached him for being with herself the cause of all Bartley's errors, and he had to bear it without protest. At the end he could say nothing but [...] "Better come home with me, Marcia," [...] and he suffered in meekness the indignation with which she rebuked him: [...] "I will stay in Bartley's house till he comes back to me. If he is dead, I will die here." ...|$|E

60|$|Of {{the value}} of {{beautiful}} costume in creating an artistic temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for beauty's sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to notice how Shakespeare appreciated {{that side of the}} question in the production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic situations and dramatic effects. And I think it is a pity that so many critics should have set themselves to attack {{one of the most important}} movements on the modern stage before that movement has at all reached its proper perfection. That it will do so, however, I feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them, indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty. Pour etre plus difficile, la tache n'en est que plus glorieuse. And if they will not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty for its result. Not that I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> that I have said in this essay. There is much with which I entirely disagree. The essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic criticism attitude is everything. For in art there is no such thing as a universal truth. A Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true. And just as it is only in art- criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can realise Hegel's system of contraries. The truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks.|$|E

Perry stated that she forgave Swift and she was sorry for her own part, and hoped they could put it behind them. Perry said, [...] "Maybe I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> she does and she doesn't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> I do, but I just really, truly want to {{come together in a}} place of love and forgiveness and understanding and compassion." ...|$|E

5000|$|The two (Kambona and Kawawa) became bitter enemies thereafter.

5000|$|Petruchio {{then starts}} {{to try to}} [...] "tame" [...] his wife {{in a variety of}} ways. He frightens Kate by yelling at the servants, and he {{prevents}} her from eating by insisting that the dishes are not good enough for her.

When Bianca and Lucentio are married, Petruchio refuses to let Kate go to the wedding unless she <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> he says, regardless of the validity of his claims.
