5|$|Model's {{decision}} to burn all his personal papers {{at the end}} of World War II means relatively little is known about his early years.

He entered the army officer cadet school (Kriegsschule) in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in 1909, where he was an unexceptional student, and was commissioned a lieutenant (Leutnant) in the 52nd Infantry Regiment von Alvensleben in 1910.

5|$|After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier {{began to}} receive offers of singing engagements. Her first {{appearance}} {{as a professional}} vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed {{by the death of}} her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, <b>a</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.|$|E
5|$|Janáček {{originally}} intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873–76). In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, {{he had to make}} do with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský's performance of the Gregorian mass was published in the March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class. On his return to Brno he earned a living as <b>a</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher,</b> and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček's wife. In 1876 he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brněnská Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.|$|E

25|$|Seah {{began her}} formal music {{training}} on the piano with her mother Lau Biau Chin, when she was five.

At the age of 21 she began her career as <b>a</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> with the Yamaha music school teaching piano and violin to children. She found little fulfilment working as <b>a</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher,</b> as she was well-aware that she is more of a performer than a teacher. When the Singapore Symphony Orchestra was set up in 1979, she applied for a position with the group and came through as a full-time performer – the only full-time staff of the arts group. Two days before the inaugural concert, the Musical Director Choo Hoey approached her to be the concertmaster of the upcoming performance, leading the first violin section and taking charge of the technical aspects of the orchestra's music making for SSO's first concert.|$|E
