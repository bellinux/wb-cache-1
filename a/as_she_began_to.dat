Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E

McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship. She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.|$|E

500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] was {{performed}} by Madonna on five of her world tours. She ended The Virgin Tour (1985) with a self-parodying performance of the song. She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At {{the end of the}} performance she asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> strip off more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The performance was included in the VHS release [...]|$|E
500|$|For a decade, Johnson's {{constant}} {{work on the}} Dictionary disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had {{to employ}} a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy, and kept hundreds of books around. John Hawkins described the scene: [...] "The books he {{used for this purpose}} were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning." [...] Johnson was also distracted by Tetty's poor health <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> show signs of a terminal illness. To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer, William Strahan.|$|E
500|$|<b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{work for}} the album with music {{executive}} Clive Davis, Clarkson was invited by Whitney Houston to record the song [...] "Breakaway", which would be included for the soundtrack of the 2004 Walt Disney Pictures feature film , which Houston had co-produced. The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate, and Avril Lavigne, was initially written for Lavigne's debut album Let Go (2002) but deemed unsuitable for the album's themes at the time. Initially reluctant, Clarkson agreed to record the song. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was first released in July 2004 by Walt Disney Records as a single from the soundtrack, acting as an interim record until her second album's lead single was released. After debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 60, it peaked at number six, {{a week before the}} album's release.|$|E

500|$|In 1991 Jackson {{signed the}} first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar {{contracts}} with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Her subsequent fifth [...] album Janet (1993) saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> explore sexuality in her music. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; she has since continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by Billboard magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade after Mariah Carey. Her seventh album All for You (2001) coincided with a celebration of her impact on popular music as the inaugural MTV Icon. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth album Discipline (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation, and released her eleventh album Unbreakable the same year.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Annie held a monthly DJ night called Pop Till You Drop with friend Frøken Blytt in her {{hometown}} of Bergen, Norway. There she met producer Tore Kroknes, and the two began dating. Annie and Kroknes borrowed a small studio from downtempo duo Röyksopp to record her debut single [...] "The Greatest Hit". The song, which uses a sample of Madonna's 1982 dance-pop single [...] "Everybody", had a limited edition release in 1999. It became an underground hit at clubs in Norway and Britain, resulting in offers for record deals. The two recorded Annie's second single, titled [...] "I Will Get On". She focused on vocals and melodies in music, and Kroknes concentrated on production, influenced by techno, disco and house music. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> work on her debut album, Kroknes became ill due to a heart defect. He died eighteen months later, in April 2001. Because of their plan to make the album together, Annie struggled with the idea of collaborating with anyone else and stopped work on it entirely.|$|E
500|$|After her husband's accession, Louise {{developed}} many ties {{to senior}} ministers {{and became a}} powerful figure within the government <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> command universal respect and affection. The queen went {{out of her way}} to stay informed about political developments at court, and from the very beginning of his reign the new king consulted Louise on matters of state. Frederick William was hesitant and cautious, and hated war, stating in 1798, [...] "I abhor war and... know of nothing greater on earth than the preservation of peace and tranquility as the only system suited to the happiness of human kind". In keeping with the later foreign policy of his father's, Frederick William favored neutrality during the early years of the conflict with the revolutionary French First Republic, which evolved into the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15); he refused the various pressures to pick a side in the War of the Second Coalition. Louise supported this view, warning that if Prussia were to side with the coalition powers of Austria, Great Britain, and Russia, it would lead to dependence on the latter power for military support. She foresaw that because Prussia was by far the weakest of the great powers, and it would not have been able to ensure it benefited from the results of such an alliance. French aggression caused the king to eventually consider entering the wars, but his indecision prevented him from choosing a side, either France or the coalition powers. He consulted the many differing opinions of Queen Louise and his ministers, and was eventually compelled into an alliance with Napoleon, who was recently victorious from the Battle of Austerlitz (1805).|$|E

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

2500|$|Bouvier {{moved back}} to Merrywood and {{was hired as a}} {{part-time}} receptionist at the Washington Times-Herald. A week later, she approached editor Frank Waldrop and requested more challenging work; she was given the position of [...] "Inquiring Camera Girl", despite Waldrop's initial concerns about her competence. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures to be published in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random [...] "man on the street" [...] vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election. During this time, Bouvier was also briefly engaged to a young stockbroker, John G. W. Husted, Jr. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in The New York Times in January 1952. She broke off the engagement after three months, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> find him [...] "immature and boring" [...] once she got to know him better.|$|E

2500|$|Lopez's debut single, [...] "If You Had My Love", was {{released}} in May 1999, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> ready her first album. Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] four months prior. During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract {{on the basis of}} her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." [...] "Waiting for Tonight", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song. Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the [...] "popular actor even more popular". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by [...] "this woman who seemed to have so many different talents". By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star. She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the process}} of {{recording}} her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> develop into a sex symbol. She changed her stage name to J.Lo, a nickname she was given by her fans. She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at {{number one on the}} US Billboard 200. During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States. The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single [...] "Play". In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that [...] "the voluptuous woman [...] almost ignored" [...] in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes. The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews. After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song [...] "I'm Real". This led to the release of [...] "I'm Real (Murder Remix)", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks. J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.|$|E
