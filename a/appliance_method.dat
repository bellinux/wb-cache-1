40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{clinical}} examination is the topic being more a part of physician work from the historical point of view. This state changes {{under the influence of}} the development of manning the crews in the rescue service. This bachelor thesis called Basic clinical examination of the client by the medical rescuer in the pre-hospital urgent care in the South-Bohemian Region summarizes the basic examinations which should be theoretically known as well as practically used by each medical rescuer. The target of the thesis was to find out the knowledge of the present medical rescuers working in the Medical Rescue Service of the South-Bohemian Region and if they observe the procedures of clinical examination. The contents of the theoretical part is the characteristics of rescue service, its last development and trend, also the young specialization of ?medical rescuer? is described, i. e. the possibilities of study, powers and contents of work. In the next part, the thesis treats the clinical examination. At first the contents of clinical examination is described, the access to it and its importance is explained, than the individual parts of the examination are analyzed. In the theoretical part, it is possible to find the information about anamnesis, methods of physical examination of all the body parts and organs. At the end, also the basic <b>appliance</b> <b>method</b> is mentioned, contributing to the clinical examination in the pre-hospital care as well as the good attitude to the patient, who is an important part also in this topic. If follows from the results of the quantitative examination that there are big differences between various degrees of the education. The graduates of secondary medical schools, of the study (after GCE) of anesthesiology-resuscitation care and intensive care and of higher professional schools have a lower knowledge in this field than their colleagues with the university education. In total the rescuers do not observe the procedures of the clinical examination more often. Both hypotheses were confirmed. It follows from the thesis that it is necessary to try to close the gap. During the studies, the clinical examination should be more accentuated, we should not reconcile with the present state. Also after the study of the branch, the topic should be repeated at the workplaces by means of theoretical lectures and practical seminars. In future, the medical rescuer will have to substitute also the physician in clinical examination, but he/she is not prepared for this up to now...|$|E

The aim of the paper is to describe the orthodontist’s approach for transferring and maintaining a therapeutic splint position into permanent occlusion using a fully customized lingual <b>appliance.</b> <b>Methods</b> Fixed acrylic bite planes on lower molars were used to maintain a symptom-free condyle position prior to orthodontic treatment. Silicone impressions of the arches including the fixed bite planes were used for the Incognito laboratory procedure. Two digital setups were made. One setup represents the target occlusion. A second setup including the bite planes was used to fabricate an additional set of lower molar brackets. In the leveling stage all teeth except the lower molars were settled to maintain the therapeutic condyle position. Finally, the fixed bite planes were stepwise removed and molar brackets were replaced to establish the permanent occlusion planned with the first setup. Results and discussion The advantage of an individual lingual appliance consists in the high level of congruence between the fabricated setups and the final clinical result. Both the individual scope for design and the precision of the appliance were vitally important in the treatment of a patient with a functional disorder of the masticatory system. </p...|$|R

The objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TORS of the tongue base with or without epiglottoplasty in patients who had not tolerated or complied with conventional treatment (continuous positive airway pressure or oral <b>appliance).</b> <b>Methods</b> Four-year prospective case series. The primary outcome measure was the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) {{in combination with the}} Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS). Mean oxygen saturation levels (SaO 2) before and after TORS on respective sleep studies were also recorded. Secondary outcome measures included operative time and complications. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessed included voice, swallow and quality of life. Results Fourteen patients underwent TORS for tongue base reduction with ten having additional wedge epiglottoplasty. A 64 % success rate was achieved with a normal post-operative sleep study in 36 % of cases at 6 months. There was a 51 % reduction in the mean AHI (36. 3 [*]±[*] 21. 4 to 21. 2 [*]±[*] 24. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 02) and a sustained reduction in the mean Epworth Sleepiness Score (p[*]=[*] 0. 002).

The authors {{conducted}} {{this study}} to assess {{the quality of the}} information available on the Web about oral hygiene for patients with fixed orthodontic <b>appliances.</b> <b>Methods.</b> The authors entered the search terms "cleaning braces," " brushing braces," and "oral hygiene and braces" into Google, Yahoo, and Bing search engines. They analyzed Web sites satisfying the inclusion criteria from the first 20 hits of each search for accessibility, usability, and reliability by using the LIDA instrument; for readability by using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score; and for the completeness of oral hygiene instructions. Results. Sixty-two Web sites met the inclusion criteria. The mean total LIDA score of 71. 2 indicated the moderate quality of the design of the reviewed Web sites. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) values of LIDA scores for accessibility, usability, and reliability were 85. 9 (7. 0), 63. 4 (16. 1), and 48. 0 (10. 4), respectively. The mean (SD) FRE Score of 68. 6 (9. 7) applied to standard reading skills. The completeness of information (mean [SD] = 67. 1 [27. 8]) presented the highest variability. Conclusions. Overall, the authors found that the standards of online oral hygiene materials for orthodontic patients with fixed appliances exhibited modest scores. Readability appeared to be appropriate for young adolescents, whereas the comprehensiveness of the displayed information was highly variable. Further improvement of the infrastructure of electronic health information (that is, e-health) in orthodontics is necessary to meet patients' needs. Practical Implications. Given the moderate quality of oral hygiene instruction available on the Web for patients with fixed appliances, orthodontic patients and caregivers should be cautious when browsing the Internet for relevant information.

40|$|Introduction. The {{effects of}} {{orthodontic}} treatment {{are considered to}} be successful if the facial harmony is achieved, while the structures of soft tissue profile are in harmony with skeletal structures of neurocranium and viscerocranium. In patients with skeletal distal bite caused by mandibular retrognathism, facial esthetics is disturbed often, in terms of pronounced convexity of the profile and change in the position and relationship of the lips. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent of soft tissue profile changes in patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion treated with three different orthodontic appliances: Fränkel functional regulator type I (FR-I), Balters’ Bionator type I and Hotz <b>appliance.</b> <b>Methods.</b> The study included 60 patients diagnosed with skeletal Class II malocclusion caused by mandibular retrognathism, in the period of early mixed dentition. Each subgroup of 20 patients was treated with a variety of orthodontic appliances. On the lateral cephalogram, before and after treatment, the following parameters were analyzed: T angle, H angle, the height of the upper lip, the position of the upper and lower lip in relation to the esthetic line. Within the statistical analysis the mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures and the factor analysis of variance were calculated using ANOVA, Bonferroni test and Student’s t-test. Results. A significant decrease of angles T and H was noticed in the application of FR-I, from 21. 60 ° to 17. 15 °, and from 16. 45 ° to 13. 40 ° (p< 0. 001). FR-I decreased the height of the upper lip from 26. 15 mm to 25. 85 mm, while Hotz appliance and Balters’ Bionator type I increased the height of the upper lip, thereby deteriorating esthetics of the patient.

However, to be precise and {{for the purposes of}} this discussion, the definition of technology is the body of knowledge available to a civilization that is of use in fashioning implements, practicing manual arts and skills, and extracting or collecting materials. 1 Surgical technologic development after the discovery of anesthesia and the acceptance of antisepsis in the 19 th century essentially involved operative instrumentation. Refinement of clamps, retractors, scalpels, and other devices in use then continued into the 20 th century. Surgical efforts focused on ways to extirpate or correct disease processes, and new innovative procedures were developed. But the technology used to perform those operations remained relatively unchanged for almost 100 years. Surgeons of the 1890 s would not have been unduly uncomfortable with the operating instruments of the 1990 s. Technology, although important, did not drive surgical practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the prospective of piezoelectric sensors in biomedical sciences to measure and analyze multiple human physiological parameters as most of the human vital sign information is non electrical, quasi-periodic and very low in amplitude, thus posing problems in detection and analysis. This paper presents a broad review on the theory and inherent advantages like high modulus of elasticity, very high natural frequency and linearity over a wide amplitude range, stability over temperature and almost negligible deflection on compression etc of the sensor. It also discusses the benefits of using a piezoelectric sensor in acquiring various bio-signals as they are non-invasive, rugged, versatile and cost effective. The electronics and signal processing involved are also presented. Existing <b>appliances</b> and <b>methods</b> where piezoelectric materials are used for bio-signal acquisition are researched and explained along with their block diagrams. It is found that these sensors are not sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, thus making them more suitable in biomedical applications. The paper gives a current, widespread review on the versatility of piezoelectric sensors for man machine interface to be used in biomedical sciences. ...|$|R
