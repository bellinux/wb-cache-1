50|$|Blair {{suggested}} that the scant archaeological evidence for built cultic structures may be because many cultic spaces in early Anglo-Saxon England did not involve buildings. Supporting this, he highlighted ethnographically recorded examples from elsewhere in Northern Europe, such as among the Mansi, in which shrines are located away from the main area of settlement, and are demarcated by logs, ropes, fabrics, and images, none of which would leave an archaeological trace. Arnold {{suggested that}} it may be mistaken to assume that the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons carried out ritual activity at specific sites, instead suggesting that such practices occurred within the domestic area. As evidence, he pointed to certain deposits that have been excavated in Anglo-Saxon settlements, such as the deposition of an <b>adult</b> <b>cow</b> above a pit of clay and cobbles which had been placed at Cowdery's Down.

5000|$|The leading {{ungulate}} prey for brown bears {{is normally}} deer. Up {{to a dozen}} species have been eaten by brown bears but the main prey species are the larger species they encounter: elk (Cervus canadensis), moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Larger deer are preferred {{because they tend to}} be less agile and swift than small or medium-sized deer (although a caribou can handily outpace a grizzly bear in the open), they are found in large quantities in several areas inhabited by brown bears and provide a larger meal per carcass. Moose may be preferred where found in large numbers because of their solitary habits and tendency to dwell in wooded areas, both of which makes them easier to ambush. Despite its diminished reputation as a predator, the brown bear is the most dangerous solitary predator of moose, with only packs of wolves a more regular predator; even Siberian tigers take other prey, primarily (elk and boar), in areas where they co-exist with the giant deer. Brown bears normally avoid the potential risks of hunting large deer, which can potentially fight back but usually escape bears by running, by picking out young calves or sickly adults from deer herds. In northeastern Norway, it was found that moose were the most important single food item (present in up to 45% of scats and locally comprising more than 70% of the bear's dietary energy) for local brown bears and several local bears appear to be specialized moose hunters, most often picking off sickly yearling moose and pregnant but healthy cows. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears who derived much of their food energy from ungulates were studied, and 30% of the ungulates consumed were through predation, the remaining amount from scavenging of carcasses. Elk, bison and moose (the three largest native ungulates in the region) each constituted nearly a quarter of the overall ungulate diet. 13% of the total of ungulates actively hunted and killed per that study in Yellowstone were elk calves, while 8% of the actively and successfully hunted prey there were <b>adult</b> <b>cow</b> elk. Despite their lack of preference for smaller deer, other species including red deer (Cervus elaphus), sika deer (Cervus nippon [...] ), axis deer (Axis axis), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), fallow deer (Dama dama), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have turned up in their diet.|$|E

40|$|Neospora caninum is a {{recently}} recognised parasite that produces infection in dogs and herbivorous. In cows, the disease {{does not produce}} clinical signs of illness, instead it produces losses. Chile has a large dairy industry and pregnancy losses in that system seem to be economically important. However {{a large number of}} abortions remain with unknown aetiology and abortion due to protozoa has not been investigated. We report here, for the first time, that aborted cows belonging to three different farms in the IX Region, Chile had antibodies to N. Caninumis given here. The episode of abortion was "sporadic" and occurred in <b>adult</b> <b>cows.</b> The sera were diluted in 1 : 200 and processed with the Neospora IFA test. Whole tachyzoite surface fluorescent was considered positive. Aantibodies were found in 10 of 21 <b>adult</b> <b>cows,</b> none of 2 heifers and 1 of 6 calves in farm A. In farm B, they were found in 7 of 24 <b>adult</b> <b>cows</b> and in 2 of 2 <b>adult</b> <b>cows</b> of farm C. All the aborted cows (2 on farm A; 3 aborted and 1 mummified on farm B; and 2 on farm C) were positive to the test. Taking into consideration the IFA test results and the negativity of serology to other common infections which cause bovine abortion, the hypothesis that these cows aborted due to Neospora infection is supported. How the disease has spread world wide is unknown, but most probably, international animal trade has contributed to help spread the disease. Before any recommendation can be made more extensive studies should be done in order to establish the prevalence and the economic impact of the disease. At the moment evidence that Neospora infection is already present in this country is presented. Therefore it should be included as a differential diagnosis of bovine abortion.

APs were also detected by western blots with the same antibody in lungs of the calves above, {{as well as in}} calves inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an <b>adult</b> <b>cow.</b> Anionic peptide (AP) immunoreactivity was detected in bands (approximate weights) in the western blots of lung at 28 - 30 (strongest signal), 31, 45, and 52 - 60 kd regardless of inoculum. The <b>adult</b> <b>cow</b> lacked bands at 45 kd, but it had additional bands at 64 (inconsistently) and 35 - 38 kd. All these band sizes are consistent with those of the western blots of human and ovine lung.

In lungs with acute inflammation induced by live bacteria, LPS, or protein, AP distribution and intensity were similar to those in control (PFS-inoculated) lungs and slightly decreased in bronchioles. This work demonstrates that AP is present in lung of cattle and is thereby conserved among two ruminant species and man. Distribution and intensity of AP production are not enhanced by infection or acute inflammation and are decreased in bronchioles, which suggests that AP is not induced like β-defensins such as LAP, but, instead, is produced constitutively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A metastatic multicentric neurofibrosarcoma of the lumbosacral plexus in an <b>adult</b> <b>cow</b> is described. The left lumbosacral plexus was obliterated by a mass which {{extended}} {{through the}} intervertebral foramen into the spinal canal {{and between the}} dorsal arches of the fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrae. A closely associated (possibly contiguous) mass extended into and separated the left sacroiliac joint. Multiple similar masses involved peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles of the pelvis, pelvic limbs, and abdominal wall. Metastatic lesions were scattered throughout the lungs. The lumbosacral lesion and all other masses consisted of interwoven bundles of loosely cohesive, elongated cells separated by variable collagenous matrix. Many neoplastic cells were positive for S- 100 protein. Ultrastructurally, fibroblastic cells were mixed with scattered cells possessing schwannian characteristics.
