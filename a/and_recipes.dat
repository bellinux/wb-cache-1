5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through {{the importation of}} ingredients and ideas from North America, China, and India {{during the time of}} the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.|$|E
5|$|In {{contemporary}} Argentina, where {{consumption of}} steak is very high, steak {{is a significant}} part of the national cuisine and the barbecue asado has the status of a national dish. In Austria, the national dish is Wiener Schnitzel, which is a type of steak made from veal. Advice on butchery <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> for American black bear steak and chops is provided by US governments.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles <b>and</b> <b>recipes.</b> Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles <b>and</b> <b>recipes,</b> proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions <b>and</b> <b>recipes,</b> to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E

25|$|Italian-American cuisine is a {{style of}} Italian cuisine adapted {{throughout}} the United States of America. Italian-American food has been shaped throughout history by various waves of immigrants and their descendants, called Italian Americans. As immigrants from the different regions of Italy settled throughout the various regions of the United States, many brought with them a distinct regional Italian culinary tradition. Many of these foods <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> developed into new favorites for the townspeople and later for Americans nationwide.|$|E
25|$|Following first {{developments}} in the 1950s, various approaches to Integrated Pest Management, Integrated Crop Management, Integrated Production and Integrated Farming were developed worldwide (in Germany, Switzerland, US, Australia, and India, for example). As {{the implementation of the}} general concept of Integrated Farming and its individual components always should be handled according to the given site and situation instead of following strict rules <b>and</b> <b>recipes,</b> the concept is virtually applicable —– and being used to various degrees —– all over the world.|$|E

25|$|The Mediterranean diet {{forms the}} basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and {{vegetables}} and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly {{on the quality of the}} ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Dishes <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to Asia. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.|$|E
25|$|Trespasser is {{the third}} and the last single-player {{downloadable}} content for the game.

New wardrobe options and a Golden Nug statue, which allows players to keep all their acquired schematics <b>and</b> <b>recipes,</b> are also introduced in this downloadable content. It was announced during PAX Prime on August 29, 2015, and was released on September 8, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

25|$|While {{hospitals}} are tax exempt, they {{pay taxes on}} the revenue-producing parts. One estimate was that interns (resident) salaries {{for the first year}} were $48,000, second year $51,000, third year $54,000, for programs affiliated with the AOA. Overlook has residency programs for doctors. As an employer, Overlook offers some employees subsidized housing, child care, meal cards, state-of-the-art libraries, online resources, and a complete benefits package. Overlook runs a cafeteria in conjunction with Baltimore-based Donna's Restaurants, Inc. The hospital pays Donna's for use of its brand name as well as methods of operation <b>and</b> <b>recipes.</b> The neurosciences research center at Overlook cost $15 million.

500|$|Among the {{projects}} of David's later years {{with which she}} worked with her editor, Jill Norman, was a single-volume collection {{of the best of}} her extensive writings. When David's health deteriorated, the project was shelved. In 1996, Norman revived it, and invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite articles <b>and</b> <b>recipes.</b> Cooks and restaurateurs who contributed included Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith and Alice Waters; among the writers were Derek Cooper, Paul Levy, Richard Olney and Katharine Whitehorn. [...] Many of them contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts <b>and</b> <b>recipes</b> are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients – eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread – interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays.|$|E

In June 1946, she suffered severe sinusitis and was told by her doctors that the condition would persist if she remained in the summer heat of Delhi. Instead, she was advised to go back to England.
