25|$|Ingressive sounds {{occur in}} many languages, being {{frequently}} associated with Scandinavian languages despite being a common phenomenon. Most {{words that are}} subject to ingressive speech are feedback words ("yes, no") or very short or primal (<b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> pain or sobbing). It sometimes occurs in rapid counting to maintain a steady air flow throughout {{a long series of}} unbroken sounds. It is also very common in animals, frogs, dogs, and cats (purring).|$|E
25|$|Calypso music grew {{together}} with Carnival. The music drew upon the West African Kaiso and French/European influences, and arose {{as a means}} of communication among the enslaved Africans. Kaiso is still used today as a synonym for calypso in Trindad and some other islands, often by traditionalists, and is also used as <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> encouragement for a performer, similar to bravo or olé. Highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals characterized the music, which was most often sung in a French Creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot (originally a similar traveling musician in West Africa) became known as a chantuelle, and eventually, calypsonian. Calypso was popularized after the abolition of slavery and the ensuing growth of the Carnival festivals in the 1830s.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
500|$|Inside, Delta Squad {{discovers the}} Locust Horde {{is locked in}} a civil war against the [...] "Lambent", a group of Locust who have been exposed to Imulsion. They decide to destroy both the Locust and Lambent forces by detonating a bomb under Jacinto, which will sink the city and flood the Locust tunnels. Marcus and Dom battle their way through the Locust tunnels, while Cole and Baird use a {{helicopter}} to transport a bomb into the cavern. A Lambent Brumak destroys the bomb before it can be detonated. Marcus improvises by using a satellite targeting solution to bombard the Brumak with an orbital laser, which causes it to violently explode. Jacinto begins to sink and sea-water floods into the sinkhole, destroying the remaining Locust forces. As the COG forces and civilians evacuate, a voiceover of the Locust Queen talks about unintended legacies. After the credits, a last voice over of Adam Fenix is heard, a radio transmission of a call for help, and <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> desperation, revealing he is still alive.|$|E
500|$|Just as {{the vanguard}} entered Arsuf {{in the middle}} of the afternoon, the Hospitaller crossbowmen to the rear were having to load and fire walking backwards. [...] Inevitably they lost cohesion, and the enemy was quick to take {{advantage}} of this opportunity, moving into any gap wielding their swords and maces. [...] For the Crusaders, the Battle of Arsuf had now entered a critical stage. [...] Garnier de Nablus repeatedly pleaded with Richard to be allowed to attack. [...] He was refused, the Master was ordered to maintain position and await the signal for a general assault, six clear trumpet blasts. Richard knew that the charge of his knights needed to be reserved until the Ayyubid army was fully committed, closely engaged, and the Saracens' horses had begun to tire. Goaded beyond endurance, the Master and another knight, Baldwin de [...] Carron, thrust their way through their own infantry and charged into the Saracen ranks with <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> “St. George!”; they were then followed by the rest of the Hospitaller knights. Moved by this example, the French knights of the corps immediately preceding the Hospitallers also charged.|$|E

500|$|On 17 June, after escorting the {{battered}} Venus back to Falmouth and collecting fresh supplies, Pellew sailed {{once more in}} search of Cléopâtre.

At 04:00 Pellew closed to investigate, and the stranger was rapidly identified as Cléopâtre, three days out of Saint-Malo. Captain Mullon initially raising all sail to escape the British frigate. By 05:00 {{it was obvious that}} Nymphe was faster than the French ship and Mullon lowered his topsails in anticipation of combat. At 06:00 Nymphe pulled within range and Mullon hailed the British ship, although his words could not be clearly made out. Accounts differ on Pellew's response, which was to elicit <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> either [...] "Hoa, Hoa" [...] or [...] "Long live King George" [...] from his men, followed by three cheers. Mullon's crew responded with either [...] "Vive la nation" [...] or [...] "Vive la république" [...] and cheering of their own, at which one French sailor attached the captain's cap of liberty to the masthead as a symbol of defiance.|$|E

2500|$|Roman Catholic teachings on {{the subject}} of prayer are {{contained}} in the Catechism, where quoting St. John of Damascus, prayer is defined as [...] "...the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God".
