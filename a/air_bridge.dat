5|$|The Future wall is {{designed}} by Chinese American artist Shan-Shan Sheng. She applied glass, a material used frequently in Hsinchu for handcraft, {{to decorate the}} wall. A set of glass bar codes suggests how the future might be. Standing at the <b>air</b> <b>bridge,</b> one can clearly see the walls that connect our past to our future.|$|E
5|$|Either {{entrance}} can be {{the front}} entrance for this symmetric building under the elevated railway. The lobby {{on the ground floor}} greets visitors entering or exiting the building. Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the escalators or stairs to the waiting areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an <b>air</b> <b>bridge.</b> Two escalators and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten emergency exits around the platforms.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1942, the Red Army {{completed}} Operation Uranus, encircling some 300,000 Axis {{personnel in}} and around the city of Stalingrad. German forces within the Stalingrad pocket and directly outside were reorganized under Army Group Don, under the command of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein. Meanwhile, the Red Army continued to allocate as many resources as possible to the eventual launch of the planned Operation Saturn, which aimed to isolate Army Group A {{from the rest of the}} German Army. To remedy the situation, the Luftwaffe attempted to supply German forces in Stalingrad through an <b>air</b> <b>bridge.</b> When the Luftwaffe proved incapable of carrying out its mission and it became obvious that a successful breakout could occur only if launched as early as possible, Manstein decided on a relief effort.|$|E
40|$|The {{techniques}} of fabricating metallic <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> using different resists in a one-step {{electron beam lithography}} are presented. The exposure process employed a single-layer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or photoresists with either different doses in the span and feet areas or with varying acceleration voltage of the electron beam. The process using photoresists with different doses has produced <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> more stable than what the PMMA method using various acceleration voltages would achieve. Using this method, <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> up to 12 mu m long have been fabricated. The length and height of these metallic <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> vary with the photoresist thickness.

5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an <b>air</b> <b>bridge</b> to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union began a {{military}} <b>air</b> <b>bridge</b> into Vientiane in early December; it was characterized {{as the largest}} Soviet airlift since World War II. This <b>air</b> <b>bridge</b> flew in PAVN artillery and gunners to reinforce the Neutralist/Pathet Lao coalition.|$|E

40|$|A general {{technique}} to characterize asymmetric coplanar waveguide (CPW) discontinuities with <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> where both the fundamental coplanar and slotline modes may be excited together is presented. First, the CPW discontinuity without <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> is analyzed using the space-domain integral equation (SDIE) approach. Second, the parameters (phase, amplitude, and wavelength) of the coplanar and slotline modes are extracted from an amplitude modulated-like standing wave existing in the CPW feeding lines. Then a 2 n x 2 n generalized scattering matrix of the n-port discontinuity without <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> is derived {{which includes the}} occurring mode conversion. Finally, this generalized scattering matrix is reduced to an n x n matrix by enforcing suitable conditions at the ports which correspond to the excited slotline mode. For the purpose of illustration, the method is applied to a shielded asymmetric short-end CPW shunt stub, the scattering parameters of which are {{compared with those of}} a symmetric one. Experiments are performed on both discontinuities and the results are in good agreement with theoretical data. The advantages of using <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> in CPW circuits as opposed to bond wires are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The United States {{began its}} own <b>air</b> <b>bridge</b> in April 1961, {{as well as}} {{photographic}} reconnaissance efforts. RLAF transport capacity was augmented to 13 C-47s, and {{were used for the}} RLAF's first significant airlift when they carried three battalions of Royal Lao troops to Sam Neua. The U. S. also supplied ten more AT-6s for ground attack missions to the RLAF via the medium of the Thai air force. During a four plane sortie by AT-6s flown from Luang Prabang's airfield during April 1961, Lieutenant Khampanh of the RLAF downed a Soviet Ilyushin Il-4 of its <b>air</b> <b>bridge</b> fleet, using unguided missiles to do so. This was the RLAF's sole air-to-air victory. However, shortcomings of the aging AT-6s were becoming apparent to the U. S. and T-28s being retired by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force were earmarked for the RLAF, but not delivered because of the truce.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{up until}} 2003, Iberia {{was the leading}} airline at the airport. With the decline of {{conventional}} airlines, in 2004 low-cost EasyJet took the lead. In 2007, Ryanair, the largest European low-cost airline established a base in Alicante. It has become the leading carrier {{at the airport in}} 2009, and by 2011 it has increased its presence further with eleven aircraft based, 62 routes, and more than 3 million passengers. However, from the end of October 2011, Ryanair has cut 31 routes due to disagreement with AENA on the usage of <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> at the new terminal (before, they would always unload on the tarmac because it is cheaper but the owners of the airport want all planes to use the <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> in the new building and not unload on the tarmac).|$|R
40|$|Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) with {{frequency}} domain read-out are intrinsically very suitable {{to use as}} building blocks for very large arrays. KIDs therefore are an attractive detector option for the SAFARI instrument on SPICA, Millimetron and also for large scale ground based imaging arrays. To study the properties of large KID arrays we have fabricated 400 pixels array made from 40 nm thick Al films on high resistivity Si substrates. The array is tested in a dry dilution refrigerator at 100 mK. We present the device design and experimental results. We also present a new design of the array with lithographic <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> over the coplanar waveguide feedline. The <b>air</b> <b>bridges</b> are designed to suppress the slot line mode in the feedline and that will improve the pixel to pixel reproducibility of large arrays...|$|R
2500|$|During the 1980s, major competition, {{especially}} on the Dublin–London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new [...] runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s. Pier A, which {{had been the first}} extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with <b>air</b> <b>bridges,</b> was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by <b>air</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
