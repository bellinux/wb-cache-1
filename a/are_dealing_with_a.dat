Lay people and practitioners consider the stages as tools to help frame and identify what a person who's suffered a loss may be feeling. The theory {{holds that the}} stages are not stops on a linear time line of grief. The theory also states that not everyone goes through all of the stages, nor in a prescribed order. In addition to the five-stages theory, Kübler-Ross has been credited with bringing mainstream awareness to the sensitivity required for better treatment of people who <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fatal disease.|$|E

California Assemblyman Willie Brown and San Francisco sheriff Richard Hongisto campaigned respectively for Miami's black community and law enforcement. Hongisto returned to California saying that Save Our Children made an issue of the existence of San Francisco when Thompson referred to the city as [...] "a cesspool of perversion gone rampant" [...] and Bob Green expressed doubt that saving San Francisco was possible.

500|$|The Church of Scientology {{released}} a statement regarding the February 10, 2008 worldwide protests, which was published February 7, 2008 in the St. Petersburg Times. In the statement, the Church of Scientology called {{the organizers of the}} protests [...] "cyberterrorists", and stated: [...] "We take this seriously {{because of the nature of}} the threats this group has made publicly. We will take every step necessary to protect our parishioners and staff as well as members of the community, in coordination with the local authorities." [...] The statement also referred to the actions of members of Project Chanology as [...] "hate crimes" [...] and [...] "religious bigotry", and in a media release said that the group is guided by Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf; one of the organizers of the protest responded to the latter allegation by stating: [...] "I don't know where they got that from, but I don't think that's true considering that I am a capitalist and a Jew". Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security. Clearwater Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that the off-duty police officers will make sure that protesters do not trespass on Scientology property or violate the law, but will report to police supervisors and not representatives of the Church of Scientology.|$|E

500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{describes}} {{a series of}} conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, [...] "The principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, {{of nature and the}} human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream." [...] Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant [...] "voice" [...] within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This {{is not to say that}} the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] perform this when he says, [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions". However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale.|$|E

As if there even were a Tunisian personality! But we <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mix of Arabs, Muslims, Jews, Maltese, French...". Bourguiba, in response, was opposed to Durel's thinking as he demonstrated by his articles in L'Étendard tunisien. The controversy that followed opposed, for nearly a month, Bourguiba and Durel, who was astonished that Bourguiba ended up with a French woman. Bourguiba then wrote that he was there to raise their son as a proper Tunisian, according to their country's culture and education. In 1973, Bourguiba testified on this controversy that had been his political start: ...|$|E
