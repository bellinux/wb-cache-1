5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

He falls asleep and has a nightmare in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.|$|E

500|$|On a late evening, Allan Gray {{arrives at}} an inn {{close to the}} village of Courtempierre and he rents a room to sleep. Gray is awakened {{suddenly}} by an old man, who enters the room and leaves a square packet on Gray's table; [...] "To be opened upon my death" [...] is written on the wrapping paper. Gray takes the package and walks outside. Shadows guide him to an old castle, where he sees the shadows dancing and wandering on their own. Gray also sees an elderly woman (later identified as Marguerite Chopin) and encounters another old man (later identified as the village doctor). Gray leaves the castle and walks to a manor. Looking through one of the windows, Gray sees the Lord of the manor, the same man who gave him the package earlier. The man is suddenly murdered by gunshot. Gray is let into the house by servants, who rush to the aid of the fallen man but it is too late to save him. The servants ask Gray to stay the night. Gisèle, the youngest daughter of the now deceased Lord of the manor, takes Gray to the library and tells him that her sister, Léone, is gravely ill. Just then they see Léone walking outside. They follow her, and find her unconscious on the ground with fresh bite wounds. They have her carried inside. Gray remembers the parcel <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> Inside is a book about horrific demons called Vampyrs.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{picks up}} Clara and takes {{her back to}} Latimer's mansion, placing her under medical care of Strax. He {{collects}} the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir London Underground biscuit tin. He and Vastra travel to Simeon's lab, where the Doctor notes the Intelligence's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA. Dr Simeon grabs the tin <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> {{only to find the}} memory worm, which latches on to him. The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence, which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon's thoughts, will vanish with the erasure of Simeon's memories. Instead, the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon's body, which it uses to attack Vastra and the Doctor. The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes, and Simeon falls dead. Outside, a salt-water rain has started, and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence: the Latimer family, crying for Clara. Strax informs the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara only has moments left, and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her. At her funeral, the Doctor reads Clara's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] who became a Dalek, whom he refers to as [...] "Soufflé Girl". He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and, bidding farewell to his allies for now, the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara. The episode concludes in contemporary times, where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard, pausing by Clara's tombstone.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Hazard Pay," [...] Walt finds {{the copy of}} Leaves of Grass as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an {{especially}} high point in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, [...] "Song of Myself," [...] is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry. The mid-season finale of season five, [...] "Gliding Over All," [...] is titled after poem 271 of Leaves of Grass. In the episode, Hank finds Leaves of Grass in Walt's bathroom <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: [...] "To my other favorite W.W.

2500|$|In a final [...] "Coda" [...] section, King urges {{the reader}} to close the book at this point, {{consider}} the story finished with a happy ending, and not venture inside the Tower with Roland. For {{those who do not}} heed the warning, the story resumes with Roland stepping into the Dark Tower. He realizes that the Tower is not really made of stone, but a kind of flesh: it is Gan's physical body. As he climbs the steps, Roland encounters various rooms containing siguls or signs of his past life. When he reaches the top of the Tower, he finds a door marked with his own name <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> Roland instantly realizes, to his horror, that he has reached the Tower countless times before. He is forced through the door by the hands of Gan and transported back in time to the Mohaine desert, back to where he was at the beginning of , with no memories of what has just occurred. [...] The only difference is that, this time, Roland possesses the Horn of Eld, which in the previous incarnation he had left lying on the ground after the [...] Roland hears the voice of Gan, whispering that, if he reaches the Tower again, perhaps this time the result will be different; there may yet be rest. [...] The series ends where it began in the first line of book one: [...] "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} album, short animated [...] "idents" [...] have been released for fictional band members Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and the Noodle cyborg.

The track can be found as a bonus track along with [...] "Pirate's Progress" [...] on the iTunes Deluxe edition. Russel's ident has him stomping off of {{the edge of a}} pier and diving into the ocean, presumably headed to Plastic Beach for reasons unknown. The fourth features a zoom in on Cyborg Noodle with its face plate open. A fifth ident was also released, showing a luxury cruise sail being bombarded by torpedoes coming from planes flying above it. A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn a passenger, who is revealed to be Noodle (wearing the oni mask), that the cruise is under attack by pirates and he was told to escort her to the lifeboats. Noodle then grabs her briefcase <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> revealing a gun, and passes the crew member while heading out, presumably to face the pirates.
