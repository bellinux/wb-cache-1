He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Vegas eRace {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} {{in the days}} before the event. The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I think this is going to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know. If <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> race on simulators at home, then maybe they are pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

6000|$|Clodd {{put down}} his hat again with a bang. [...] "Oh! {{confound}} that conscience of yours! Don't it ever think of your creditors? What's the use of my working out my lungs for you, when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to hamper me at every step?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O, it's no trouble--perfectly simple. If {{you want}} to load it up loud and strong, you stand right over it and shout. But if you leave it open and all set, it'll eavesdrop, so to speak--that is to say, it will load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it. Now I'll show you how it works. I had an expert come and load this one up yesterday. Hello, it's been left open--it's too bad--still I reckon it hasn't had much chance to collect {{irrelevant}} stuff. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to press this button in the floor--so." ...|$|E

Do {{you know what}} I call you--you and your {{thousand}} quid? A tuppenny millionaire, that's what I call you. Keep your blooming money. That's all I ask. Keep it. Much good you'll get out of it. I know your sort. You'll never have any pleasure of it. Not you. You're the careful sort. You'll put it into Consols, you will, and draw your three-ha'pence a year. Money wasn't meant for your kind. It don't mean nothing to you. You ain't got the go in you to appreciate it. A vegetable--that's all you are. A blanky little vegetable. A blanky little gor-blimey vegetable.

"Make your admonition either more gentle or more strong, {{according}} as {{you have}} more or less access to them: but always moderate the roughest part of your reproof, with the gaiety of your air, and a smiling countenance; by the civility of well-mannered words, and a sincere protestation that <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> but an effect of the kindness you have for them. It is good also to add respectful submissions to the pleasingness of your discourse, with tender embraces, and all the marks of that consideration and goodwill you have for the person of him whom you thus correct. For, if a rigid countenance, and harsh language, should accompany reproof, which of itself is hard of digestion, and bitter to the taste, {{it is not to}} be doubted but men, accustomed to flatteries, will not endure it; and there is reason to apprehend, that a burst of rage against the censor, will be all the fruit of the reprimand.|$|E

5000|$|He carries on: [...] "It's so comical {{watching}} the feminist postmodernists in particular rattle {{on about the}} absence of gender reality and act out the archtypical devouring mother {{at exactly the same}} time.
