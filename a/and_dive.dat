5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{depending}} {{on the model of}} the roller coaster, the track size can vary. Models such as the Flying, Wing, <b>and</b> <b>Dive</b> Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.|$|E
5|$|The {{decompression}} schedule may {{be derived}} from decompression tables, decompression software, or from dive computers, and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, are designed to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> duration.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based aircraft carriers, and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti-aircraft guns to protect themselves and other ships (principally the US aircraft carriers) from Japanese fighters <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected to mount a considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} {{designed}} to escort the US fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers, the Iowa-class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40mm mounts and 49 single 20mm mounts. In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20mm and 40mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20mm and 40mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier Graf Zeppelin {{was the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two carriers of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only {{aircraft carrier}} launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> bombers.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier II was a proposed conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary {{aircraft carrier}} with a capacity for twenty-three fighters <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and labor, {{and the threat of}} Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in zero gravity, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player {{has the ability to}} run, climb ladders, swim <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> underwater for a limited period of time. Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into a first-person perspective. Playing as Jill, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the game.|$|E

5|$|Coker {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, firing a combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures. Despite adverse weather conditions, Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers <b>and</b> <b>dive</b> bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective.

The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E
