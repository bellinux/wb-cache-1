5|$|Daario Naharis and Jorah Mormont {{continue}} to trace Daenerys Targaryen's location. Jorah takes <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> observe his worsening greyscale. They discover her {{ring in the}} middle of thousands of hoof-prints, deducing that she has been taken by the Dothraki.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare them, {{see that they}} are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton is in love with Nannetta. Finding <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E

5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> {{make eye contact with}} the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|While Picard is {{escorted to}} be executed, he convinces the Son'a Gallatin (Gregg Henry) {{to help him}} stop Ru'afo. Picard masterminds a ruse to {{transport}} Ru'afo and his bridge crew to the holoship and shut down the harvester. Ru'afo discovers the deception and transports to the radiation harvester ship to manually restart the process. Picard follows and sets the harvester to self-destruct, which kills Ru'afo while Picard is rescued by the Enterprise. The remaining Son'a are forgiven and welcomed back by the Ba'ku. Picard arranges a meeting between Gallatin and his Ba'ku mother. The Enterprise crew take <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> enjoy their rejuvenated selves before returning to their previous mission.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E

25|$|The ceia dos criadores is {{a dinner}} {{organized}} {{in honor of}} the farmers who have contributed animals for the meal, or who have contributed gifts to the brotherhood. Much like the briança it serves as <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> raise funds for the events; those invited traditionally include illustrious social figures and local politicians.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 local time, a {{thin white}} plume of smoke seemed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} {{the election was}} over, and the 40,000 people who had spent the afternoon watching the ceremonies on large screens in St. Peter's Square broke into applause and song. But the smoke quickly grew stronger and clearly dark. The crowd quieted and cleared {{in a matter of}} minutes.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that Jung was cast in the English-language 3D remake of John Woo's The Killer. The film was to be shot in Los Angeles, and reunite him with <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>to</b> Remember director John H. Lee and Reign of Assassins director John Woo acting also as producer. The project has been put on hold while John Woo works on another film.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Carl (Chandler Riggs) {{covers for}} his mother Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as they take shelter in a boiler room. Lori has gone into labor, but is {{bleeding}} profusely during her contractions. Lori demands Maggie perform a lethal Caesarean section to deliver the child. The baby is delivered safely, but Lori dies; Carl takes <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> mourn before shooting her in the head to prevent reanimation.|$|E
25|$|Awakening {{can mean}} the end of sleep, or simply <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> survey the {{environment}} and readjust body position before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken soon after the end of a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening {{and the end of the}} sleep episode. Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.|$|E

25|$|Dantzig's {{original}} {{example was}} {{to find the best}} assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe. However, it takes only <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible solutions that must be checked.|$|E

25|$|Jung's next roles {{would be}} in highly romantic roles that played off his {{established}} screen image. In the box office hit <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>to</b> Remember he played an architect whose wife (played by Son Ye-jin) is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and in the Netherlands-set Daisy, he played a hired assassin {{who falls in love}} with a street artist played by Jun Ji-hyun. He portrayed a happily committed fireman in Sad Movie, and rekindled a romance with an old friend in A Good Rain Knows. His big-budget martial arts films The Restless and Reign of Assassins would also have romantic elements.|$|E

25|$|Qigong {{involves}} coordinated movement, breath, {{and awareness}} used for health, meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners consider tàijíquán to be {{a type of}} qigong, the two are commonly distinguished as separate but closely related practices, with qigong playing {{an important role in}} training for tàijíquán, and with many tàijíquán movements performed as part of qigong practice. The focus of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications. Internally the main difference is the flow of qi. In qigong, the flow of qi is held at a gate point for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> aid the opening and cleansing of the channels. In tàijíquán, the flow of qi is continuous, thus allowing the development of power for the use by the practitioner.|$|E
25|$|After the screening, the {{two couples}} stayed outside the theatre {{for a while}} but {{separated}} about 23:15. Olof and Lisbet Palme headed south {{on the west side}} of Sveavägen, towards the northern entrance of the Hötorget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveavägen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> look at something in a shop window, continued past the Dekorima shop which was then located on the corner of Sveavägen and Tunnelgatan, and headed for the metro station entrance on the other side of Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, halfway across the street and only a few metres from the station entrance, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, up the steps to Malmskillnadsgatan and continued down David Bagares gata , where he was last seen.|$|E
25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E
