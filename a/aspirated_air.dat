40|$|Abstract — In {{the context}} of {{increasingly}} stringent pollution standards, engine pollutant emission reduction is a great challenge for spark ignition (SI) engines. The very narrow operating zone of the three-way catalyst necessitates a good control of the air/fuel equivalence ratio and therefore a good estimation of the <b>aspirated</b> <b>air</b> mass. We consider in this study a turbocharged SI engine equipped with variable valve timing actuators (VVT). This device acts as a disturbance by impacting on the air mass flow through the inlet valves. This impact can be estimated from real-time measurement. Two observers of the <b>aspirated</b> <b>air</b> mass are then proposed in this paper. After proving convergence in the two cases, we carry out comparisons based on simulation results. I...|$|E

40|$|In diesel engines, it is {{difficult}} to reduce both smoke and NOx simultaneously. An experimental study was conducted to determine the performance and exhaust emission characteristics of a commercial single cylinder, natural <b>aspirated,</b> <b>air</b> cooled DI diesel engine. The system was modified to work on either dual fuel or diesel alone. The objective of this work is to investigate the possibility of decreasing the exhaust emissions and to determine the performance parameters. At part loads, the dual fuelled operation suffers from higher CO and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. This is mainly due to overall lean mixture and incomplete combustion because of small quantity of pilot fuel. To resolve these problems, the effects of cooled EGR were investigated. The experimental results show that the application of EGR reduces substantially NOx, CO and smoke. Results indicate that performance parameters are comparable with baseline diesel operation...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effects of two factors: the granular material feed rate and the <b>aspirating</b> <b>air</b> flow-rate. The study was conducted with mm-size ABS and HIPS particles, two granular materials originating from genuine information technology wastes. The tribo-charging processes in PVC and Al pipes were modeled using the response surface method of experimental design. An induction type sensor, connected to an electrometer has been employed for the measurement of the charge imparted to a well-defined section of the duct, which is equal to the charge transferred to the particles passing through that section of the pneumatic transport system. The measured data were processed by a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW and then analyzed using a commercial software (MODDE 5. 0, Umetrics, Sweden). Under the specific conditions of the experiments described in this paper, the charge/mass ratio of the processed particles was found to increase with the <b>aspirating</b> <b>air</b> speed, but was less affected by the granular material feed rate.

The addition of premixed fuel enhances the air fuel mixture strength and for that the combustion duration is decreased in dual fuel operation. From this experiment it was observed the 70 % and 67 % reduction in smoke emission from premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel when compared to neat diesel operation. In addition to that, the oxides of nitrogen emissions were reduced to 30 % and 24 % for premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel. In particular, premixed gasohol reduces the smoke and oxides of nitrogen emissions more than the ethanol and also, significant increase in brake thermal efficiency was noted in 20 % premixed gasohol and ethanol in dual fuel mode, when compared to neat diesel operation...|$|E
40|$|Xylem {{vessels in}} grapevines Vitis labrusca L. and Vitis riparia Michx. growing in New England {{contained}} air over winter and yet filled with xylem sap and recovered their maximum hydraulic conductance {{during the month}} before leaf expansion in late May. During this period root pressures between 10 and 100 kilopascals were measured. Although some air in vessels apparently dissolved in ascending xylem sap, results indicated that some is pushed out of vessels and then out of the vine. Air in the vessel network distal to advancing xylem sap was compressed at about 3 kilopascals; independent measurements indicated this was sufficient to push air across vessel ends, and from vessels to the exterior through dead vine tips, inflorescence scars, and points on the bark. Once wetted, vessel ends previously air-permeable at 3 kilopascals remained sealed against air at pressures up to 2 and 3 megapascals. Permeability at 3 kilopascals was restored by dehydrating vines below − 2. 4 megapascals. We suggest that the decrease in permeability with hydration is due to formation of water films across pores in intervascular pit membranes; this water seal can maintain a pressure difference of roughly 2 megapascals, and prevents cavitation by <b>aspirated</b> <b>air</b> at xylem pressures less negative than − 2. 4 megapascals...|$|E

Precise viable bacterial counts of serial stool specimens were examined for the first eight weeks after birth in 10  infants. The colonisation rates of administered bacteria were examined using immunohistochemical staining of stool specimens with a B breve specific monoclonal antibody.  RESULTS—In the preliminary study there were no side effects attributable to the bacteria.

In case of heavy water moderator nuclear reactors, the decay heat of a fuel bundle enclosed in the pressure tube and outer concentric calandria tube can be transferred to the moderator. Radiation heat transfer plays a significant role in removal of decay heat from the fuel rods to the moderator, which is available outside the calandria tube.

There is a need to increase energy supplies to meet basic needs and {{to do it in a}} way that promotes sustainable development. Bio-diesel is an attractive alternative fuel which is renewable, non-toxic, reduces carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission due to higher content of oxygen. Bio-diesel has higher kinematic viscosity, low calorific value, poor fuel atomization, piston ring sticking and has lubricating oil dilution problem but this fuel is can be used as blend with diesel to overcome all these problems. Biodiesel blends has sort out many problems like reducing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Along with this biodiesel has high cetane number which is a measure of fuel’s ignition quality. It replaces the exhaust odour of petroleum diesel with more pleasant smell of popcorn or French fries. Though many advantages biodiesel is not so popular because of high NOx emission. So to take advantage of this alternative fuel one EGR technique has been developed to reduce NOx emission as it enables lower flame temperature and oxygen concentration in combustion chamber. The objective of this study is to investigate the usage of biodiesel blends and EGR simultaneous in order to reduce NOx emission along with other regulated pollutants from diesel engine without any engine modification. For this single cylinder, naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>air</b> cooled direct injection diesel engine is used for experimental work and different blends of biodiesel like B- 20, B- 50 and B- 100 are used to compare the engine performance and parameters such as brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and emission characteristics are calculated from measured data.

The main objective of this scientific paper is to work out the methods of dispersed composition prediction and dust concentration in extracting local exhausts air in the areas of arbitrary geometry taking into account vortical transitional currents which occur as a result of abrupt modification of area configuration. The mentioned method is based on the introduction of finite number of different fractions dust particles into the stream at every design moment of definite time period and on the tracing of their behavior until they are caught or precipitated. The stream of air current is designed {{on the basis of the}} method of discontinuous vortexes. Vortical transitional currents are formed as a result of current isolation from sharp edges of area border, and also from smooth surface on the spot of tangential gear constituent change.
