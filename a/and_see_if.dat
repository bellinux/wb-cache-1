5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention.

25|$|One {{can also}} study {{sufficiently}} simplified models for which computers {{can be used}} to carry out calculations <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> a procedure suggested by perturbation theory may work beyond it. The second concept allows one {{to address the issue of}} defining a relativistic theory ab initio without limiting the definition to perturbative expansions. This option is particularly relevant to the issue of describing bound states in QCD. However, to address this issue one needs to overcome certain difficulties that the renormalization group procedures based on the idea of reduction of cutoffs are not capable of easily resolving. To avoid the difficulties, one can employ the similarity renormalization group procedure. Both the difficulties and similarity are explained in the next section.|$|E
