40|$|The {{observation}} that people already carry lots of personal devices (e. g., a smart phone, an electronic identity card, an <b>access</b> <b>badge,</b> an electronic car key, a laptop, [...] .), serves as {{starting point for}} this thesis. Furthermore, {{with the arrival of}} smart objects, the number of things that think one carries is expected to grow. Sensors will be built into clothing and attached to the body to monitor our health. It is clear that these devices need to be protected. However, due to the vast amount of devices involved, the traditional approach of protecting each device on its own, results in a usability nightmare. We investigate how to tap into the potential that arises from cooperation between these devices. This is done by deploying threshold cryptography on personal devices. Threshold cryptography has the benefit of increased overall security, since an adversary can compromise a number (up to the threshold number) of devices without gaining any advantage towards breaking the overall security. Furthermore, the end-user does not need to carry all his personal devices, any subset of size at least the threshold number is sufficient {{to make use of the}} threshold security system. We propose technical solutions to tackle some of the practical issues related to this approach, paving the road for real world implementations. First, we show how one can include devices that do not have the necessary (secure) storage capabilities needed to store shares (e. g., car keys) in our threshold scheme. Second, we investigate how the end-user can add or remove devices from his set of personal devices used in this threshold scheme. Finally, in order to get user acceptance, the (location) privacy of consumers should not be disregarded. Towards this goal we examine how to achieve private and secure device authentication over an open channel. This is done specifically for RFID tags, which are the least powerful devices that can be included in our threshold system. Hence, the location of the end-user can be kept private, while all communication between his personal devices, that arises from our threshold solution, goes over an open channel. nrpages: 148 + 20 status: publishe...|$|E

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) uses one of these interface designs in its security access booths. Along with the RAP B insert-style reader, the authors tested five prototype RAP variants, each with a different style of swipe badge reader, through which a badge is moved or swiped. The authors asked the untrained test subjects to use each RAP while they described how they thought they should respond so that the system would operate correctly in reading the magnetic strip on a security badge. With each RAP variant, subjects were required to make four successful card reads (swipes) in which the card reader correctly read and logged the transaction. After each trial, a subject completed a 10 -item interface acceptance evaluation before approaching the next RAP. After interacting with the RAP interfaces (for a total of the six RAP trials), each subject completed a 7 -item overview evaluation that compared and ranked the five experimental RAPs, using the original (RAP B) insert style as a standard...|$|R
40|$|No two {{physical}} {{objects are}} exactly the same, even when manufactured with a nominally identical process. For example, two sheets of paper that are indistinguishable with the naked eye, still differ considerably in their nanoscale fiber structures. Although manufacturing variability is usually undesired, the associated ability to uniquely identify a physical object, which is constrained to an integrated circuit (IC) in this thesis, can be leveraged for security purposes. To facilitate the registration of unique features, a so-called physically unclonable function (PUF) can be implemented on the IC. A PUF circuit {{is designed to be}} sensitive to process variations, i. e., challenged with a binary input, it provides a binary, device-unique response. This building block can hence be understood as the silicon equivalent of human biometrics. PUFs can augment the security architecture of an ever-increasing number of electronic devices that access our personal data and/or represent our identities. This includes but is not limited to smartphones, credit cards, <b>access</b> <b>badges,</b> the sensors and actuators of automated home, and medical implants.

Numerous newly revealed flaws and attacks are presented throughout this thesis. On the bright side, the lessons learned can help improve the quality of future PUF-based systems.

40|$|Both {{government}} agencies and private companies are investing significant resources to improve local/remote <b>access</b> security. <b>Badge</b> or password-based procedures {{have proven to be}} too vulnerable, while biometric research has significantly grown, mostly due to technological progresses that allow using increasingly efficient techniques, yet at decreasing costs. Suitable devices capture images of user's face, iris, etc., or other biometric elements such as fingerprints or voice. Each biometry calls for specific procedures. Measures from user's data make up the so called biometric key, which is stored in a database (enrolment) or used for recognition (testing). During recognition, a subject's key is matched against those in the database, producing a similarity score for each match. However, some drawbacks exist. For example, iris scanning is very reliable but presently too intrusive, while fingerprints are more socially accepted but not applicable to non-consentient people. On the other hand, face recognition represents a good solution even under less controlled conditions. In the last decade, many algorithms based on linear/non-linear methods, neural networks, wavelets, etc. have been proposed. Nevertheless, during Face Recognition Vendor Test 2002 most of them encountered problems outdoors. This lowers their reliability compared to other biometries, and underlines the need for more research. This chapter provides a survey of recent outcomes on the topic, addressing both 2 D imagery and 3 D models, to provide a starting reference to potential investigators. Tables containing different collections of parameters (such as input size, recognition rate, number of addressed problems) simplify comparisons.

40|$|Much of today’s {{security}} for financial assets, services, facilities, personal information, immigration, employment and travel {{is provided in}} the form of a variety of ID instruments such as passports, credit cards, ID <b>badges,</b> <b>access</b> cards, and other similar forms of identification.

Each new generation of ID documents and cards becomes more technologically sophisticated and difficult to forge, forcing criminals to resort to increasingly complex and sophisticated forms of attack to circumvent their security mechanisms. Against this backdrop, ID Enrollment systems become particularly enticing targets for theft and unauthorized use, because with their use of authentic security materials, algorithms and production mechanisms, these systems are capable of producing truly undetectable fraudulent ID instruments capable of passing any and all security tests performed by even the most sophisticated ID verification terminals.

40|$|The DOE has {{identified}} the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ARGUS system {{as the standard}} entry control system for the DOE Complex. ARGUS integrates several key functions, specifically, badging, entry control, and verification of clearance status. Not all sites need or can afford an ARGUS system. Such sites are therefore limited to commercial equipment which provide ARGUS like features. In this project an alternative way to integrate commercial equipment into an integrated system to include <b>badging,</b> <b>access</b> control, property control, and automated verification of clearance status has been investigated. Such a system would provide smaller sites the same functionality as is provided by ARGUS. Further, it would allow sites to fully participate in the DOE`s concept of Complex wide access control. This multi-year task is comprised of three phases. Phase 1, system requirements and definitions, and phase 2, software and hardware development, were completed during fiscal year 1994. This report covers these two phases and the demonstration system which resulted. Phase three would employ the demonstration system to evaluate system performance, identify operational limits and to integrate additional features.
