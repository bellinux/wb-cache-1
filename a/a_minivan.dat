500|$|Several of CP+B's {{advertising}} {{programs for}} Burger King, including ones for the Whopper, drew criticism from groups for perceived cultural insensitivity or misogynistic themes within them. In May 2006, in an American {{promotion of the}} Texas Double Whopper, Burger King released a campaign called the [...] "Manthem" [...] which parodies Helen Reddy's [...] "I Am Woman".

Disappointed by the meager portions he is served, the man bursts into song, expressing his desire for a Texas Double Whopper, in place of what he deems [...] "chick food." [...] As he walks out of the restaurant, he is joined by a chorus of men who rebel by not only eating Texas Double Whoppers, but also go commando, lift <b>a</b> <b>minivan</b> over the side of an overpass, and unfurl a banner which says [...] "Eat This Meat."

500|$|The school {{privileges}} {{its financial}} independence and accessibility over sufficient budgeting, {{a result of}} Leue's governance choices. The Free School does not receive government funding and instead subsists on student tuition and supplemental income from rental properties and [...] "extensive fundraising". Student tuition is billed on a sliding scale: parents give what they can afford. In 2012, about 80 percent of the school's families were eligible for free or reduced-price public school meals, and Free School parents paid an average monthly tuition of [...] (substantially below the [...] cost per child). In 2012, one half the school's students lived in Albany's inner-city South End (mostly black and Latino, with a burgeoning immigrant population), one fourth lived in uptown neighborhoods, and one fourth lived in the suburbs. Leue initially struggled to recruit children of upwardly mobile families, who thought the school would limit their children's chances to join a suitable income bracket. She found that low-income, black families were the most skeptical about the school's usefulness. The school also provides inexpensive (or free) preschool and daycare for young children, operates a car collective (wherein a dozen people share <b>a</b> <b>minivan),</b> and provides low-interest loans through a community credit system.|$|E
500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into <b>a</b> <b>minivan,</b> which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E
