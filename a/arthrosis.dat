5000|$|The {{general term}} [...] "degenerative joint disease" [...] refers to {{arthritis}} (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) and <b>arthrosis.</b> The term <b>arthrosis</b> may cause confusion since in the specialized TMD literature {{it means something}} slightly different from in the wider medical literature. In medicine generally, <b>arthrosis</b> can be a nonspecific term for a joint, any disease of a joint (or specifically degenerative joint disease), and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis. In the specialized literature that has evolved around TMD research, <b>arthrosis</b> is differentiated from arthritis {{by the presence of}} low and no inflammation respectively. Both are however equally degenerative. The TMJs are sometimes described {{as one of the most}} used joints in the body. Over time, either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint, wear and degeneration can occur, termed osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune joint disease, can also affect the TMJs.

For those who reached adulthood, the average death age was 40.7 years (males) and 34.1 years (females), and only 4.4%, primarily men, reached the age of 60 years.

Medical research of teeth revealed a healthy diet with sufficient protein and low carbohydrate shares and a two-year breastfeeding period.

Combined with high rates of <b>arthrosis</b> deformans, likewise primarily affecting males, and other skeleton deformations, this points to high physical strain especially of the male population.

Radiographic <b>arthrosis</b> was graded according to the system of Broberg and Morrey. Bivariate and multivariable analyses evaluated risk factors for radiographic <b>arthrosis.</b> Of 139 patients, 75 had radiographic evidence of <b>arthrosis</b> at final evaluation and 32 had moderate or severe radiographic <b>arthrosis.</b> Mechanism of injury, age, gender, follow-up time, occupation, and limb dominance were not associated with radiographic <b>arthrosis.</b> Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the type of injury as the only independent predictor of moderate to severe radiographic <b>arthrosis.</b> Patients with a bicolumnar fracture of the distal humerus, a capitellum/trochlear fracture, or an elbow fracture-dislocation were 8. 0, 7. 3, and 5. 2 times more likely (odds ratio), respectively, to develop radiographic evidence of moderate or severe radiographic <b>arthrosis</b> than the average patient in this cohort.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reviews the}} latest state of knowledge concerning the etiology, determinants and possibilities for prevention by intervention on life-style factors for <b>arthrosis.</b> Both primary, secondary and tertiary prevention are covered. <b>Arthrosis</b> {{is the most}} prevalent disease of the musculoskeletal system. It is most common in the elderly and especially in women. The diagnosis is based on complaints, physical examination, laboratory results and X-ray photos. Symptoms are pain, stiffness and limitation in movement, but not everybody has these symptoms. The etiology of <b>arthrosis</b> is not very well known. There are several hypotheses. The most accepted hypothesis states {{that the process of}} <b>arthrosis</b> begins in the cartilage. Knowledge on the course of <b>arthrosis</b> is also limited. The life-style factors physical activity and smoking are related to the occurrence and/or course of <b>arthrosis.</b> Smoking seems to decrease the risk of the occurrence of <b>arthrosis.</b> The results of the studies are still inconsistent. Studies about the relation between physical activity and <b>arthrosis</b> looked at effects on the occurrence {{as well as on the}} course. It was thought that 'normal' physical activity increases the risk of <b>arthrosis.</b> There becomes more and more evidence that this is not true. Physical activity in the form of physiotherapy is used in the treatment of <b>arthrosis,</b> because it helps to keep the joints flexible. There is not much known about the etiology and course of <b>arthrosis.</b> Research on these subject should be stimulated. Primary prevention through intervention on life style factors is not very promising. At the moment early detection is most important in secondary prevention. Screening is not yet possible.
