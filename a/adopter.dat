5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early <b>adopter.</b> It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} find out whether there are {{systematic}} differences between early <b>adopters</b> and a matched control group of non early <b>adopters</b> of FRS 114 (Segment Reporting) based on the following company characteristics: (1) firm size, (2) board characteristics, (3) leverage, (4) audit firm size, and (5) firm growth rate. Using a sample of 32 early <b>adopters</b> and without differentiating whether they disclose the required segment information in full or partially and a control group of 32 non early <b>adopters,</b> our findings indicate company with higher proportion of non executive directors, particularly non independent non executives, is more likely to adopt FRS 114 before the effective date. When early <b>adopters</b> are further classified into full or partial <b>adopters,</b> the result shows that full early <b>adopters</b> are significantly larger (in terms of total assets) than non early <b>adopters.</b> However, when comparing between partial early <b>adopters</b> and non early <b>adopters,</b> the evidence suggests that partial early <b>adopters</b> are significantly smaller in size than non early <b>adopters.</b> We find no evidence to indicate that there are significant differences between full early <b>adopters,</b> partial early <b>adopters</b> and non early <b>adopters</b> in terms of board size, board leadership, independent directors, audit firm size, leverage and firm growth rate...|$|R

30|$|Our first {{analysis}} {{consists of}} observations for all firms that voluntarily adopted {{the new rules}} and for mandatory <b>adopters.</b> However, these subgroups may differ significantly in their incentives and therefore in their levels of financial reporting properties. It is possible that voluntary <b>adopters</b> welcomed the new rules and adopted them {{as soon as possible}} with the aim of improving the information provided in their consolidated statements. As the number of voluntary <b>adopters</b> in our sample is quite low (78 firms in 2009), {{it is possible that the}} effects of mandatory <b>adopters</b> outweigh the effects of voluntary <b>adopters.</b> To check whether the results for the financial reporting properties differ for voluntary <b>adopters,</b> we run an additional analysis. For the control group, we use mandatory GALMA <b>adopters</b> instead of IFRS companies. As described above, this research design also suffers a potential self-selection bias, as companies do not randomly decide to adopt GALMA voluntarily. Therefore, the results might also be attributable to differences in pre-existing firm characteristics.|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{evidence}} {{to bear on}} the question of the long-term effects of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws on findings from survey data collected in four U. S. towns and cities in fall 2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that early <b>adopters</b> of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities and to have higher levels of community involvement than later <b>adopters.</b> Further, early <b>adopters</b> are more likely to use the Internet to increase their community involvement and political participation. Later <b>adopters</b> in all four sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later <b>adopters</b> are less civic minded and more interested than early <b>adopters</b> in consumer and commercial applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh, 2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other studies of early innovation <b>adopters</b> (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995, among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily to the behavior of early <b>adopters,</b> making such increases a phase, not a trend. As later <b>adopters</b> come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic engagement in geographic communities. Comment: 29 th TPRC Conference, 200...|$|R
