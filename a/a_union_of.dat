5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T.

Cuney established his own business of stevedores and <b>a</b> <b>union</b> <b>of</b> black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we prove the following: The semigroup which is <b>a</b> {{disjoint}} <b>union</b> <b>of</b> {{two or three}} copies of a group is a Clifford semigroup, Rees matrix semigroup or a combination between a Rees matrix semigroup and a group. Furthermore, the semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> finitely many copies of a finitely presented (residually finite) group is finitely presented (residually finite) semigroup. The constructions of the semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> two copies of the free monogenic semigroup are parallel to the constructions of the semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> two copies of a group, i. e. such a semigroup is Clifford (strong semilattice of groups) or Rees matrix semigroup. However, the semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> three copies of the free monogenic semigroup {{is not just a}} strong semillatice of semigroups, Rees matrix semigroup or combination between a Rees matrix semigroup and a semigroup, but there are two more semigroups which do not arise from the constructions of the semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> three copies of a group. We also classify semigroups which are disjoint <b>unions</b> <b>of</b> two or three copies of the free monogenic semigroup. There are three types of semigroups which are <b>unions</b> <b>of</b> two copies of the free monogenic semigroup and nine types of semigroups which are <b>unions</b> <b>of</b> three copies of the free monogenic semigroup. For each type of such semigroups we exhibit a presentation defining semigroups of this type. The semigroup which is <b>a</b> disjoint <b>union</b> <b>of</b> finitely many copies of the free monogenic semigroup is finitely presented, residually finite, hopfian, has soluble word problem and has soluble subsemigroup membership problem...|$|R

5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia.

With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, <b>a</b> <b>union</b> <b>of</b> 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia's domestic politics in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.|$|E

5|$|In 1448 and 1451, {{there was}} {{a change in the}} Byzantine and Ottoman leaderships, respectively. Murad II died and was succeeded by Mehmed the Conqueror whilst Constantine XI Palaiologos succeeded John VIII. Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well; the former's {{successful}} conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter, who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region, and Mehmed had around 40,000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains. Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan regarding the status quo. Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance. The Ottomans already controlled the land around Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453. Despite <b>a</b> <b>union</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the Byzantines received no official aid from the Pope or Western Europe, {{with the exception of a}} few soldiers from Venice and Genoa.|$|E

He was appointed {{a member of the}} Commission des territoires d'outre-mer (Commission of Overseas Territories). During this time, he worked to implement the wishes of the SAA, in particular proposing a bill to abolish forced labor—the single most unpopular feature of French rule. The Assembly adopted this bill, known as Loi Houphouët-Boigny, on 11 April 1946, greatly enhancing the author's prestige not only in his country. On 3 April 1946, Houphouët-Boigny proposed to unify labour regulations in the territories of Africa; this would eventually be completed in 1952. Finally, on 27 September 1946, he filed a report on the public health system of overseas territories, calling for its reformation.
