60|$|The {{financial}} and <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> of the scheme {{has been very}} carefully studied {{by the light of}} all available information. The report of the actuarial authorities whom I have consulted leaves me in no doubt that, even after all allowance has been made for the fact that unemployment may be more rife in the less organised and less highly skilled trades than in the trade unions who pay unemployment benefits--which is by no means certain--there is no doubt whatever that a financially sound scheme can be evolved which, in return for moderate contributions, will yield adequate benefits. I do not at this stage propose to offer any figures of contributions or benefits to the House. I confine myself to stating that we propose to aim at a scale of benefits which would be somewhat lower both in amount and in duration of payments, than that which the best-organised trade unions provide for their own members, but which, at the same time, should afford a substantial weekly payment extending over by far the greater part of the average period of unemployment of all unemployed persons in these trades.|$|E

Salaried workers and employees below the relatively high income threshold of almost 50,000 euros per year are automatically enrolled into one of currently around 130 public non-profit [...] "sickness funds" [...] at common rates for all members, and is paid for with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider payment is negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified self-governed bodies (e.g. physicians' associations) {{at the level of}} federal states (Länder).

5000|$|Germany has a {{universal}} multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: [...] "Law-enforced health insurance" [...] (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) known as sickness funds [...] "Krankenkasse" [...] and [...] "Private" [...] (Privat Krankenversicherung). Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit [...] "sickness funds" [...] at similar rates for all members, and {{is paid for}} with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) {{at the level of}} federal states (Länder). The sickness funds are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis.</b> Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may decide to remain in the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or opt out & take private insurance. Private supplementary insurance to the sickness funds of various sorts is available.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the health insurance}} industry’s response to the welliness movement between 1960 and 1990. Based primarily on insurance and personnel management trade publications, it argues that the health insurance industry cautiously joined the weliness campaigns of the 70 s and 80 s despite its on-going reservations regarding the <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> for rate differentials. The industry’s business-like conservatism was overcome by its recognition of wellness promotion as a cost-control measure, public relations tool, and means {{to stave off the}} threat of further governmental oversight and regulation...|$|E

40|$|Social Insurance {{has been}} defined as "The method of {{organized}} relief by which wage earners, or persons similarly situated, and their dependants and survivors, became entitled to specific pecuniary or other benefits, on the occurence of certain emergencies. " It should be added that to be 'insurance', the method used must be on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> although it need not be contributory. There are four main emergencies which Social Insurance is designed to provide against, namely: industrial accidents, sickness, unemployment and an impecunious old age. I shall in this monograph deal, first, with the theoretical aspect of Social Insurance, and, secondly, with the application of the principles to Canadian conditions. I shall limit the subject matter to a discussion of Workmen's Compensation, National Health Insurance, and Unemployment Insurance. [ [...] . ...|$|E

We also may conclude that it would be advantageous to bring about in the course of time a complete centralization of unemployment compensation in the federal government and terminate all state control over such functions. Other aims should be the establishment of the system on a sound <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> by adjusting the oontributions and benefits in accordance with actual experience and also the examination of the pay roll tax collecting machinery now in operation to see if such work cannot better be handled by an agency other than the Bureau of Internal Revenue...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} acute {{pancreatitis}} occurring over a 20 -year {{period in the}} Bristol clinical area is reported. A total of 590 cases were available for analysis. The yearly incidence was 53 - 8 per million population at risk, with a mortality of 9 - 0 per million. This compares favourably with 11 - 4 deaths per million for England and Wales as a whole {{during the same period}} but the difference is not statistically significant. When the deaths occurring in the Bristol clinical area were expressed in terms of case mortality rate the figure was 17 %. In contrast the mortality for recurrent acute pancreatitis was only 1 - 5 %, and the benign nature of this second condition is confirmed. Aetiological factors and age and sex distribution were also analysed in relation {{to each other and to}} mortality. An increase in acute pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcoholism was confirmed and steroid pancreatitis also emerged as a definite entity in this survey. The pattern of recurrence in patients with idiopathic pancreatitis was studied in detail and is analysed on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis...</b>|$|E
40|$|I thank Merrill Lynch {{for funding}} this {{description}} of America’s demographic transition {{and its implications}} for America and Americans. Certain sections of this study draw very heavily and without quotation on Gokhale and Kotlikoff (2001 a and 2001 b), Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2001), Gokhale, Kotlikoff, and Neuman (2001), and Ferguson and Kotlikoff (2000). 1 Executive Summary This study takes a careful look at our nation’s fiscal finances. It questions the much-heralded short-term federal budget surpluses, scrutinizes Social Security’s and Medicare’s long-term finances, and examines the nation’s overall long-run fiscal balance based on a new generational accounting for the U. S. The study also examines how the economy will respond to population aging and Social Security’s privatization using a state-of-the-art life-cycle dynamic general equilibrium computer simulation model. The study’s final sections a) use a highly detailed micro simulation model to determine, on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> the effects of possible Social Security reforms on different postwar cohorts and income groups within those cohorts, b) use ESPlanner [...] a sophisticated life-cycl...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the public pension system in Japan and traces its {{development}} against the overall background of the socioeconomic developments since 1950 s. The country’s establishment of a public pension system that covers the entire population took place fairly recently. It was only in 1961 that the compulsory pension plan for the selfemployed was introduced. Together with the already existing income-compensation scheme for retired civil servants and various employees ’ pension plans, every Japanese gained access to a public pension plan {{in one form or}} another. Just because the public pension was installed late, however, does not mean that its financial status was sound. On the contrary, the social security reform in the early 1970 s changed the landscape of Japanese public pension virtually overnight. Put simply, benefits overshot prospective contributions. The paper recommends that since the unfounded pension systems such as the one adopted by Japan are at the mercy of demographic changes, developing countries should adopt pension systems with sound <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis.</b> World Bank InstituteCopyright © 200...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} an actuarial {{valuation}} {{is to provide}} a timely best estimate of the ultimate costs of a retirement system. Actuarial valuations of IPERS are prepared annually to determine whether the statutory contribution rate will be sufficient to fund the System on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> i. e. the current assets plus future contributions, along with investment earnings will be sufficient to provide the benefits promised by the System to current members. The valuation requires the use of certain assumptions with respect to the occurrence of future events, such as rates of death, termination of employment, retirement age and salary changes to estimate the obligations of the System. The basic purpose of an experience study is to determine whether the actuarial assumptions currently in use are accurately predicting actual emerging experience. This information, along with the professional judgment of System personnel and advisors, is used to evaluate the appropriateness of continued use of the current actuarial assumptions. When analyzing experience and assumptions, it is important to realize that actual experience is reported short term while assumptions are intended to be long term estimates of experience...|$|E
40|$|A single {{valuation}} basis (using market values) now {{dominates the}} valuation of pension scheme assets and {{has replaced the}} previously dominant actuarial and accounting bases. The same cannot be said for pension scheme liabilities. There are three different valuation bases for liabilities currently in use: a statutory basis (specified in the 1986 Finance Act), an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> (the Minimum Funding Requirement, specified in the 1995 Pensions Act) and an accounting basis (specified in Financial Reporting Standard 17). Since each of these uses different underlying assumptions, the three bases are not consistent {{with each other and}} produce substantially different measures of pension scheme liabilities. None of these measures corresponds to an economic valuation. Moves should be made to develop a single valuation basis for pension liabilities. A key difference relates to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future pension payments. The Accounting Standards Board’s new FRS 17 and the recent MFR Review conducted by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries have both proposed a bond-based discount rate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is pushing pension fund asset allocations towards bonds in an attempt to reduce the short-term volatility mismatch between assets and liabilities. Moves should be made t...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} accident costs and annual miles driven with mileage and claims data representing approximately 3 million individual car years of insurance exposure for private passenger automobiles in Massachusetts in the 2006 policy year. Poisson and linear models relating pure premium to annual mileage estimates demonstrate that mileage is {{a significant predictor of}} insurance risk, that mileage alone cannot replace traditional rating factors such as class and territory, and that mileage gains in explanatory power when used in conjunction with those traditional rating factors. These findings provide a strong <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> for pay-as-you-drive insurance, in which drivers are charged rates per mile that differ depending on the driver’s class and territory. A model of consumer response to pay-as-you-drive insurance based on studies of miles elasticity to gasoline prices suggests that if all drivers in Massachusetts switched to per mile insurance policies, aggregate vehicle miles traveled in the state would drop by 5. 0 % to 9. 5 %. Greenhouse gas emissions from private passenger automobiles would be reduced by a similar amount, and the social equity implications of pay-as-you-drive insurance would be positive. On the basis of sound actuarial justification and positive social benefits, this study finds a strong argument in favor of the regulatory approval of pay-as-you-drive insurance...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} risk of developing multiple sclerosis in optic neuritis in a tropical and sub-tropical area PJ LANDY From the Department ofNeurology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, South Brisbane, Australia SUMMARY 110 cases of optic neuritis were prospectively studied. 62 (56 %) developed multiple sclerosis, 13 were lost to survey. However, eight of these had recurrent episodes of optic neuritis. If recurrent episodes of optic neuritis are accorded the same significance as demyelination else-where in the CNS, then the incidence of multiple sclerosis in the series rose to 71 %, similar to that predicted on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis.</b> Optic nerve demyelination occurs at some stage in the course of multiple sclerosis in almost every patient. ' However, the risk reported in the literature of patients with optic neuritis developing multiple sclerosis varies widely. Kurland et al 2 placed the per-centage at 11 - 5 %, whereas Lynn 3 and McAlpine 4 found that 85 % of optic neuritis cases developed multiple sclerosis. These studies were retrospective. In a {{prospective study}} of sixty-one cases Sandberg Wollheims found 27 % of cases developed multiple sclerosis and Cohen et a 16 followed sixty cases of optic neuritis and found 28 % later developed multi-ple sclerosis. There is a wide variance in the series reported from the United States and those of Euro-pean studies, and the possibility of some geographi-cal basis arises...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhthmia after direct-current cardioversion. Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days. Multivariate {{analysis was used to}} identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome. Cardioversion was achieved in 70 % of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96 % of patients with atrial flutter. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p < 0. 001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p < 0. 02) and age (p < 0. 05) independently influenced conversion rate. On an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> 42 and 36 % of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0. 008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0. 002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0. 03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode. Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0. 03). In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified. This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequential}} use {{of different}} types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> the 2 -year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31 % after stage I to 63 % at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1. 8 +/- 0. 8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events...|$|E
40|$|The Hancock porcine valve was {{the first}} commercially {{available}} biologic heart valve {{and has been in}} continuous use at the Brigham and Women's Hospital since January 1972. Through December 1987 we implanted 1678 valves in 1533 patients (885 male; 648 female; 17 to 95 years of age, with a mean of 60 years). There were 825 aortic valve replacements (AVR), 562 isolated mitral valve replacements (MVR), and 146 aortic mitral replacements (DVR). Ninety-four per cent of the patients were functional class III or IV. Associated coronary bypass was done in 25 % of patients. Four per cent of patients were lost to follow up during a 1 - to 16 -year period with a mean of 6 years. Morbidity and mortality rates on a <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> were calculated 10 and 15 years after operation for AVR, MVR, and DVR. The data indicates that the probability of reoperation for structural valve failure is quite reasonable as of 10 years, but from 10 to 15 years the numbers sharply fall off so that the probable effective life of the valve is 10 years. However in the elderly age group (equal to or greater than 70 years of age) the incidence of structural valve degeneration is markedly diminished, making this an ideal valve substitute for the elderly. It is also an ideal valve substitute in any patient who has a contraindication to long-term anticoagulation because of current medical or surgical problems...|$|E
40|$|Where {{there is}} a {{significant}} <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis</b> for decision making (e. g., the occurrence of fires in single-family dwellings), there is little incentive for formal risk management. Formal risk assessments are most useful in those cases where the value of the structure is high, many people may be affected, the societal perception of risk is high, consequences of a mishap would be severe, and the actuarial uncertainty is large. For these cases, there is little opportunity to obtain the necessary experiential data to make informed decisions, and the consequences in terms of money, lives, and societal confidence are severe enough to warrant a formal risk assessment. Other important factors include the symbolic value of the structure and vulnerability to single point failures. It is unlikely that formal risk management and assessment practices will or should replace the proven institutions of building codes and engineering practices. Nevertheless, formal risk assessment can provide valuable insights into the hazards threatening high-value and high-risk (perceived or actual) buildings and structures, which can in turn be translated into improved public health, safety, and security. The key is to choose and apply the right assessment tool to match the structure in question. Design-for-reliability concepts can be applied to buildings, bridges, transportation sys- tems, dams, and other structures. The use of these concepts could have the dual benefits of lowering life-cycle costs by reducing the necessity for maintenance and repair and of enhancing the saiiety and security of the structure's users...|$|E
40|$|Sentencing is a backward- and forward-looking enterprise. That is, {{sentencing}} {{is informed}} by an individual’s past conduct {{as well as by}} the criminal justice system’s prediction of the individual’s future criminal conduct. Increasingly, the criminal justice system is making these predictions on an <b>actuarial</b> <b>basis,</b> computing the individual’s risk of recidivism according to the rates of recidivism for people possessing the same group characteristics (e. g., race, sex, socio-economic status, education). The sentencing community is drawn to this statistical technique because it purportedly distinguishes with greater accuracy the high-risk from the low-risk, and thereby allows for a more efficient allocation of sentencing resources, reserving incarceration for the truly dangerous and saving the low-risk from needless penal attention. Despite these asserted benefits, risk-assessment tools are exogenous to the theories of punishment, the very foundation for sentencing in Anglo-American jurisprudence. This Article reviews the legality and propriety of actuarial predictive instruments, using these theories and governing constitutional and statutory law as the touchstone for this analysis. This Article then applies these normative and legal principles to seventeen major characteristics that may comprise an offender’s composite risk profile. It argues that risk-assessment instruments are problematic for three reasons: they include characteristics that are prohibited by constitutional and statutory law; subject the individual to punishment for characteristics over which the individual has no meaningful control; and presume that the individual is a static entity predisposed, if not predetermined, to recidivate, thereby undermining individual agency and betting against the individual’s ability to beat the odds...|$|E
