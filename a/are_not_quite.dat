5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks.

25|$|A marine seismic {{reflection}} {{study found}} evidence of faulting {{at the mouth of}} Budd Inlet, just north of the Olympia structure, and aligning with faint lineaments seen in the lidar imagery. These faults <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> aligned with the Olympia structure, striking N75W (285°) rather than N45W (315°). It is uncertain how these faults relate to the structure, and whether they are deep-seated faults, or fractures due to bending of the shallow crust.|$|E
25|$|The {{diamond-shaped}} False Cross {{is composed}} of the four stars Delta and Kappa Velorum (δ and κ Vel) and Epsilon and Iota Carinae (ε and ι Car). Although its component stars <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> as bright {{as those of the}} Southern Cross, it is somewhat larger and better shaped than the Southern Cross, for which it was often mistaken, causing errors in astronavigation. Like the Southern Cross, three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} {{trends in}} cation-π binding energy <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> analogous to trends in aryl reactivity. Indeed, {{the effect of}} resonance participation by a substituent does not contribute substantively to cation-π binding, despite being very important in many chemical reactions with arenes. This was shown by the observation that cation-π interaction strength {{for a variety of}} substituted arenes correlates with the σmeta Hammett parameter. This parameter is meant to illustrate the inductive effects of functional groups on an aryl ring.|$|E

25|$|However, things <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> that simple. The zero-point energy {{cannot be}} {{eliminated}} by dropping its {{energy from the}} Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|DED {{is caused}} by a micro-fungus {{transmitted}} by two species of Scolytus elm-bark beetle which act as vectors. The disease affects all species of elm native to North America and Europe, but many Asiatic species have evolved anti-fungal genes and are resistant. Fungal spores, introduced into wounds in the tree caused by the beetles, invade the xylem or vascular system. The tree responds by producing tyloses, effectively blocking the flow from roots to leaves. Woodland trees in North America <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> as susceptible to the disease because they usually lack the root-grafting of the urban elms and are somewhat more isolated from each other. In France, inoculation with the fungus of over three hundred clones of the European species failed to find a single variety possessed of any significant resistance.|$|E
