2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> {{has been}} the {{shortage}} of cement to sustain the construction boom in the country. However, foreign and native investment, including the recent investment in a US$5 billion cement factory in Misraq Gojjam Zone of the Amhara Region, are an attempt to stabilize the situation. Still the brief severe shortage that occurred in 2005 was blamed on Meles Zenawi's policies that were alleged to ignore urban development. Other recent development in the country included a first car factory in Ethiopia that assembles cars to sell for local- and export-markets, as well as cars that use liquefied petroleum gas, bus manufacturing in Mek'ele and taxi manufacturing in Modjo city, Oromia state. The dramatic development of most sectors in Ethiopia–including textiles, leather, garments, agriculture, beverages, construction, and others–has caused Ethiopia to be labeled the [...] "East African land of opportunity" [...] by the World Investment News.|$|E

Leo Hayes High School places priority on both Arts and Athletics, in addition to Academia. In addition, there are four middle schools, fourteen elementary schools and three private schools in the city. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> with middle schools in {{the city has been}} the location of George Street Middle School and Albert Street Middle School close to the city centre.

[...] "For, {{even if you}} throw out all the {{enormous}} mass of evidence accumulated by spiritistic investigators, {{you still have the}} conversion of Wallace, Lodge, and Lombroso, not to speak of De Vesme, Venzano, and other well-known men of science, to account for. Even Crookes himself admits that nothing but some form of spirit hypothesis is capable of explaining all the phenomena; and in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> of the Annals of Psychic Science Lombroso writes a paper making several very strong points against the biologic theory. One of these is the simultaneous occurrence of phenomena. 'Can the subconscious self act in several places at once?' he asks. A second objection {{lies in the fact that}} movements occur in opposition to the will of the psychic--as, for example, when Eusapia was transported in her chair. 'Can a man lift himself by his boot-straps?' is the question. 'The centre of gravity of a body cannot be altered in space unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, the phenomena of levitation cannot be considered to be produced by energy emanating from the medium.'" ...|$|E

She was born in Prague, in June, 1854, and her early youth was spent on a country estate of her parents. Since her eighteenth year she has travelled extensively, spending her winters in some one of the large cities. Rome, Paris or Brussels, and her work shows the keen observation and cool judgment of a cosmopolitan writer. She is well liked in England." [...] The story under consideration is infinitely sad, beautiful, exalting. At one moment you are rejoicing at the idyllic happiness of the lover, the bright promise of a glorious future. Then the scene changes, and your heart is bleeding with unutterable anguish at the mute grief that follows the irreparable loss of his love, which carries in its train lost ambition, talent, manhood. Just let us quote one passage: [...] "There is a suffering so painful that no hand is tender enough to touch it, and so deep that no heart is brave enough to fathom it. Dumbly we sink the head, as before something sacred. Never could he reproach her lying there before him, clad in the blue dress, of which every fold, so dear to him, cried 'forgive!' Not to our desecrated love do I appeal, but to our sweet caressing friendship,--forgive the sister what the bride has done!' How could he reproach her, with her parting kiss still on his lips?" ...|$|E
