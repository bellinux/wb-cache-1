In March 1868, Cornell’s President-elect Andrew Dickson White sailed to Europe to inspect leading institutions of agricultural and industrial education, recruit faculty, purchase laboratory <b>apparatus,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and books. Cornell Faculty appointees provided White with booklists and the Cornell Board of Trustees allocated $11,000 in February 1868 to make what became [...] "large purchases of books at Paris, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Berlin and London." [...] While visiting the University of Berlin, White obtained the first of several private book collections which formed the beginning of the Cornell Library. The 2,500 volume personal library of University of Berlin philologist Franz Bopp was offered for sale by the scholar's estate. The collection was rich in Near Eastern studies sources. After White returned to Ithaca, the Cornell Board of Trustees authorized the purchase Charles Anton’s 7,000 volume library. The Anton library added materials on classical languages, literatures and ancient history.|$|E

Diwan Bahaddur S K Rodda, {{a member of the}} Bombay Legislative Council on behalf of Southern Division, for three terms, undertook a vigorous campaign to collect two lakh of Rupees for the foundation of Karnatak College. Rao Bahaddur R C Artal, {{one of the founders of}} the Lingayat Education Association, Dharwad, collected one hundred thousand of rupees toward the establishment of the Karnatak College. Sir Siddappa T Kambli, Minister of Education, Government of Bombay, was deeply involved in improving the education facilities in North Karnataka. He was responsible for the transfer of materials, <b>apparatus,</b> <b>equipment</b> and library books from the closed Deccan College, Poona, to the Karnatak College, Dharwad.

40|$|The Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} components of the Integrated Rescue System. Its overall development and modern equipment allows for a very effective way to provide assistance in all types of emergencies. The breathing <b>apparatus</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is one of the}} many parts of the common personal protective equipment that allows firefighters to remain within even a stifling environment. The aim of this thesis was to make a full analysis of the numbers and the range of age in use of these kinds of breathing apparatuses and cylinders, which belong to the units of the equipment in the Fire Rescue Service of the South Bohemia Region. Furthermore, I have made a comparison between the two basic types of air breathing apparatuses that are being used, in terms of the protection period, which have been provided to the users (carriers). The participants of this inquiry were members of the FRS of the South Bohemia Region, which include the separation of chemical and technical services into the various local departments. I have received the data from twenty different fire stations in total. In the questionnaire which was given, I collected the data from the respondents, according to their age and added the number of different types of breathing apparatus and cylinders and period or time of use to this study. The data was collected during February and March 2010. Hypothesis 1 : the number of pieces of the breathing <b>apparatus</b> <b>equipment</b> in the South Bohemia Fire Rescue units is sufficient; this was confirmed. The result has been compared with the numerical data collected from the indicated positions in the current legislation set to 1. 7 times of the number of the members serving in one inning. Hypothesis 2 : that these breathing apparatuses meet the requirements of all of the current legislation; this has not been confirmed. The result shows a comparison of the technical parameters of the instruments and technical conditions, as reported by the Interior Ministry decree No. 255 / 1999 Coll. as amended, regarding the technical conditions kind of fire. The results will be used to establish the financial balance sheet and the planned purchases of the pressurized breathing <b>apparatus</b> <b>equipment</b> and the used variations of the composite cylinders...|$|E

Further, this work occupies itself with switching high voltage equipment, their qualities and distribution, with their electrically driven mechanism, including the method of their control. Moreover, the work is aimed at {{the configuration of the}} logical operation with the aid of the Boole functions for controlling the feeder terminal apparatus within the CAP 505 software, and at its following testing on the REF 543 terminal from the ABB Company. The aim of the work is theoretical analysis of controlling and operational manipulations in a high voltage distribution system, the following creation and registration of the blocking conditions as well as with their use to create a functional configuration of the feeder terminal of the distribution system and its testing on the demonstration panel which is set with the REF 543 terminal and with further <b>apparatus</b> <b>equipment</b> that simulates the complete high voltage distributor. In the factory configuration the simulation is carried out by the LOGO! module from the Siemens Company. Therefore, our further aim is to design and subsequently to connect the feeder terminal so that the controlling and signaling panel elements could be connected directly to inputs and outputs of REF 543 terminal and could so enable its controlling and checking of the operation conditions. The main aim of the work is to elaborate {{a detailed description of the}} functional configuration creation as well as the following REF 543 terminal adjustment for testing the blocking conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the implementation of}} the Advanced level chemistry curriculum in Gweru district secondary schools in Zimbabwe. To guide this study seven research questions were raised and answered. The study employed a descriptive survey design and three instruments were used to collect data from 6 secondary schools selected from 12 schools in the district using the Probability Proportionate to Size (PPS) sampling technique. Six (6) school heads, 10 chemistry teachers and 130 students participated in the study. The instruments used for data collection were a questionnaire, interviews and personal observations. The study established that the important factors that limit the quality of chemistry teaching and learning include overloaded curriculum content and inadequate time for teaching chemistry; inadequate resources, <b>apparatus,</b> <b>equipment</b> and consumables. Insufficient funding of science, lack of support staff and ineffective teaching methodologies further limit the quality of chemistry teaching and learning. The study recommends the in servicing of chemistry teachers to give them a better orientation on what is expected of them and expose them to current methods of teaching and presenting content materials to learners.

Experience with the bacteriological microbiological and marine Biotoxin analyses of shellfish and shellfish growing waters have indicated that minor differences in laboratory procedures or techniques might cause wide variations in the results. Improper handling of the sample may also cause variations in results during collection or transportation to the laboratory.
