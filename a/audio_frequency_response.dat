The most notable attempt at this was in 1951, when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records, which released a series of 78rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves).

50|$|Unlike {{telegraph}} {{and telephone}} systems, which used completely {{different types of}} equipment, most radio receivers were equally suitable for both radiotelegraph and radiotelephone reception. In 1903 and 1904 the electrolytic detector and thermionic diode (Fleming valve) were invented by Reginald Fessenden and John Ambrose Fleming, respectively. Most important, in 1904-1906 the crystal detector, the simplest and cheapest AM detector, was developed by G. W. Pickard. Homemade crystal radios spread rapidly during the next 15 years, providing ready audiences for the first radio broadcasts. One limitation of crystals sets {{was the lack of}} amplifying the signals, so listeners had to use earphones, and it required the development of vacuum-tube receivers before loudspeakers could be used. The dynamic cone loudspeaker, invented in 1924, greatly improved <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. AM radio offered the highest sound quality available in a home audio device prior to the introduction of the high-fidelity, long-playing record in the late 1940s.|$|E

However, because the system relies on light, visual obstruction has the ability to severely disrupt the signal, which can cause problems with sound quality. The <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> spans a wide range of 20-20,000 Hz with a transmission frequency of 2.3 MHz and a max volume of 125 dB. However, it has been noted that infrared systems are known for exhibiting glitches with the quality of their sound, producing low wavelengths of noise, which can be a problem for those with hearing impairments. With their wireless capabilities, TV Ears may be used with many different kinds of plasma and LCD flat screen televisions, cable, or satellite boxes with audio analog port capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} radio {{broadcasting}} increased {{the market for}} radio receivers greatly, and transformed them into a consumer product. At {{the beginning of the}} 1920s the radio receiver was a forbidding high-tech device, with many cryptic knobs and controls requiring technical skill to operate, housed in an unattractive black metal box, with a tinny-sounding horn loudspeaker. [...] By the 1930s, the broadcast receiver had become a piece of furniture, housed in an attractive wooden case, with standardized controls anyone could use, which occupied a respected place in the home living room. In the early radios the multiple tuned circuits required multiple knobs to be adjusted to tune in a new station. One of the most important ease-of-use innovations was [...] "single knob tuning", achieved by linking the tuning capacitors together mechanically. [...] The dynamic cone loudspeaker invented in 1924 greatly improved <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. Convenience features like large lighted dials, tone controls, pushbutton tuning, tuning indicators and automatic gain control (AGC) were added.

50|$|The carbon microphone, {{also known}} as carbon button microphone, button microphone, or carbon transmitter, {{is a type of}} microphone, a {{transducer}} that converts sound to an electrical audio signal. It consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon. One plate is very thin and faces toward the speaking person, acting as a diaphragm. Sound waves striking the diaphragm cause it to vibrate, exerting a varying pressure on the granules, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates. Higher pressure lowers the resistance as the granules are pushed closer together. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules. The varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave. In telephony, this undulating current is directly passed through the telephone wires to the central office. In public address systems or recording devices it is amplified by an <b>audio</b> amplifier. The <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> of the carbon microphone, however, is limited to a narrow range, and the device produces significant electrical noise.|$|R

The off–line test shows that, at low <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> between about 100 Hz and 1 kHz, the spectrum of the sensor output signal is proportional to the base velocity. Moreover at frequencies above the fundamental resonance frequency of the transducer, the output signal shows a - 90 o phase lag with reference to the base velocity.

Today's embedding and detection strategies often rely on digital/ high quality channels, like CD or mp 3. However for numerous applications, watermarks surviving noisy analog environments are better suited or even required. Using such schemes allows to identify, audio signals with monitoring devices which are 'listening' to the incoming signals. In the same way, illegal recordings of concerts can be identified. In this paper we describe a test environment for noisy, acoustic, (analog) channels and present results obtained from a particular watermarking scheme.

Based on the presented test results, we identify the parameters relevant for watermarks to successfully survive noisy acoustic channels and thereby provide valuable hints for audio watermark designers.
