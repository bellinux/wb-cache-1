5000|$|... #Caption: A type of {{transmission}} line called a cage line, used for high power, low frequency applications. It functions similarly {{to a large}} coaxial cable. This example is the <b>antenna</b> <b>feedline</b> for a longwave radio transmitter in Poland, which operates at a frequency of 225 kHz and a power of 1200 kW.|$|E
5000|$|A {{monopole}} antenna is {{a class of}} radio antenna consisting of a straight rod-shaped conductor, often mounted perpendicularly over some type of conductive surface, called a ground plane. The driving signal from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between {{the lower end of}} the monopole and the ground plane. One side of the <b>antenna</b> <b>feedline</b> is attached to {{the lower end of the}} monopole, and the other side is attached to the ground plane, which is often the Earth. This contrasts with a dipole antenna which consists of two identical rod conductors, with the signal from the transmitter applied between the two halves of the antenna.|$|E
50|$|An antenna tuner, a matchbox, transmatch, {{antenna tuning}} unit (ATU), or antenna coupler is a device {{connected}} between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching {{the impedance of}} the radio to the <b>antenna's</b> <b>feedline.</b> Similar matching networks are used in other equipment (such as linear amplifiers) to transform impedance.|$|R

5000|$|The Goubau line itself {{consists}} of a single wire conductor coated with dielectric material. [...] Coupling {{to and from the}} G-line is done with conical metal [...] "launchers" [...] or [...] "catchers", with their narrow ends connected for example to the shield of coaxial feed line, and with the transmission line passing {{through a hole in the}} conical tips. [...] An advantage of the Goubau line is that it can have lower attenuation due to dielectric losses at high frequencies than other types of transmission line. Parallel line (twin lead) and coaxial cable, which are used to carry lower frequency radio signals, have high losses at the upper end of the UHF band, and are almost useless for distances over 100 feet (33 meters). [...] Goubau lines can serve as low loss <b>antenna</b> <b>feedlines</b> at these frequencies, up to microwave frequencies where waveguide must be used." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{the loss}} of power is very low in the line {{carrying}} the transmitter's signal into the antenna, a tuner at the transmitter end can produce a worthwhile degree of matching and tuning for the <b>antenna</b> and <b>feedline</b> network as a whole. With lossy feedlines, maximum power transfer only occurs if matching is done {{at both ends of}} the line.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the keys}} to {{successful}} ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating is antenna performance. In Alcator C-Mod, we have investigated the compatibility of high power ICRF antennas with high performance plasmas and all high-Z plasma facing components, to provide operational information for future devices such as ITER. Boronization appears to be critical to control plasma radiation but it can be quickly eroded particularly in the presence of ICRF. Here we present circumstantial evidence that suggests RF-enhanced sheaths on flux tubes passing near the antennas terminating {{on the top of the}} outer divertor are the most likely erosion mechanism. In addition, antenna operation without a Faraday screen was found to degrade antenna performance through increased impurity production local to the antenna. Analysis suggests that this impurity source might be reduced or mitigated by modifying the antenna strap design. At high neutral pressure, the antenna voltage handling degraded rapidly above a threshold, so-called neutral pressure limit. This degradation was confirmed by benchtop experiments to be related to discharge formation in the vacuum coaxial lines of the <b>antenna</b> <b>feedlines.</b> Reducing the secondary emission coefficient below unity for these regions was shown in tests to substantially raise this limit. Ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating is expected to be an important auxiliar...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} a 4 × 8 array antenna with aperture-coupled patch antenna elements. The antenna {{was designed for}} 60 GHz operation and fabrication on the low-temperature cofired ceramic(LTCC) substrate(εr= 5. 8). The feedline with the stub was designed to enhance the radiating element bandwidth and the transition characteristics between the waveguide (WG) and microstrip line(MSL). Through the optimization of the <b>antenna</b> and <b>feedline</b> geometry, the <b>antenna</b> gain {{and the performance of}} the 10 dB bandwidth were 20. 2 dBi and 13 % up, respectively. The measured results agreed with the simulated ones...|$|R
50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, a desiccator {{may be used}} {{to pressurize}} the feedline of a high-power transmitter. Because it carries a large amount of energy from the transmitter to the <b>antenna,</b> the <b>feedline</b> must have low dielectric losses. Because it must also be lightweight so as not to overload the radio tower, air is often used as the dielectric. Since moisture can condense in these lines, desiccated air or nitrogen gas is pumped in. This pressure also keeps water or other dampness from coming in the line at any point along its length.|$|R
50|$|A {{link budget}} is {{accounting}} {{of all of}} the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a telecommunication system. It accounts for the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the <b>antenna</b> gains, <b>feedline</b> and miscellaneous losses. Randomly varying channel gains such as fading are taken into account by adding some margin depending on the anticipated severity of its effects. The amount of margin required can be reduced by the use of mitigating techniques such as antenna diversity or frequency hopping.|$|R

50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, {{the term}} transmitter plant {{is the part}} of the physical plant associated with the transmitter and its controls and inputs, the studio/transmitter link (if the radio studio is off-site), the radio <b>antenna</b> and radomes, <b>feedline</b> and desiccation/nitrogen system, broadcast tower and building, tower lighting, generator, and air conditioning. These are often monitored by an automatic transmission system, which reports conditions via telemetry (transmitter/studio link).|$|R
5000|$|The {{radio waves}} from an antenna element that reflect off a ground plane appear {{to come from}} a mirror image of the antenna located {{on the other side of}} the ground plane. In a {{monopole}} antenna, the radiation pattern of the monopole plus the virtual [...] "image antenna" [...] make it appear as a two element center-fed dipole antenna. So a monopole mounted over an ideal ground plane has a radiation pattern identical to a dipole <b>antenna.</b> The <b>feedline</b> from the transmitter or receiver is connected between the bottom end of the monopole element and the ground plane. The ground plane must have good conductivity; any resistance in the ground plane is in series with the antenna, and serves to dissipate power from the transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|Without an ATU, the SWR from a {{mismatched}} <b>antenna</b> and <b>feedline</b> can reflect {{power back}} into the transmitter (backlash current [...] ) heating and/or burning parts of the output stage. Modern solid state transmitters will automatically reduce power when high SWR is detected, so some solid-state power stages only produce weak signals if the SWR rises above 1.5 to 1. Were it not for that problem, even the losses from an SWR of 2:1 could be tolerated, since only 11 percent of transmitted power would be reflected and 89 percent sent out through to the antenna. So the main loss of output power with high SWR {{is due to the}} transmitter [...] "backing off" [...] its output when challenged with backlash current.|$|R
50|$|A {{loading coil}} or load coil is an {{inductor}} that is inserted into an electronic circuit {{to increase its}} inductance.

It presents a low profile ultra-wideband tightly coupled phased array <b>antenna</b> with integrated <b>feedlines.</b> The approach consists of applying broadband techniques to an array of capacitively coupled planar element pairs with an octagonal fractal geometry, backed by a ground plane.

Each of the four sides are the same length. The length is not critical, typically from one to two wavelengths (λ). A horizontal rhombic antenna (picture, top right) radiates horizontally polarized radio waves at a low elevation angle off the end of the <b>antenna</b> opposite the <b>feedline.</b> Its principal advantages over other types of antenna are its simplicity, high forward gain and wide bandwidth, the ability to operate over a wide range of frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|Antenna {{matching}} {{methods that}} use transformers tend {{to cover a}} wide range of frequencies. A single, typical, commercially available balun can cover frequencies from 3.5 - 30.0 MHz, or nearly the entire shortwave radio band. Matching to an antenna using a cut segment of transmission line (described below) is perhaps the most efficient of all matching schemes in terms of electrical power, but typically can only cover a range about 3.5 - 3.7 MHz wide [...] - [...] a very small range indeed, compared to a broadband balun. <b>Antenna</b> coupling or <b>feedline</b> matching circuits are also narrowband for any single setting, but can be re-tuned more conveniently. However they are perhaps the least efficient in terms of power-loss (aside from having no impedance matching at all!).|$|R

The third design is to design and develop dual feed Quadri-Polarization States microstrip patch antenna feeding with microstrip line.

50|$|Many Boston area {{residents}} complained about poor reception from WFXT's digital signal {{compared to the}} market's other major television stations. This {{was due to the}} fact that the transmitter previously operated at a reduced power output of 78 kilowatts from an antenna mounted below one of the tines of the Candelabra tower in Needham. WFXT's vice president of engineering Bill Holbrook stated publicly that the digital signal would not reach full power until August 2009, when installation of a new antenna and transmitter was expected to be completed. However, the signal upgrades were completed in April 2009, giving WFXT a signal considered to be on par with the Boston market's other full-power stations. The new <b>antenna</b> and transmission <b>feedline</b> had been replaced two weeks earlier. The license to cover was filed on April 23, 2009.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a low profile}} ultrawideband tightly coupled phased array <b>antenna</b> with integrated <b>feedlines.</b> The aperture array consists of planar element pairs with fractal geometry. In each element these pairs are set orthogonal {{to each other for}} dual polarisation. The design is an array of closely capacitively coupled pairs of fractal octagonal rings. The adjustment of the capacitive load at the tip end of the elements and the strong mutual coupling between the elements, enables a wideband conformal performance. Adding a ground plane below the array partly compensates for the frequency variation of the array impedance, providing further enhancement in the array bandwidth. Additional improvement is achieved by placing another layer of conductive elements at a defined distance above the radiating elements. A Genetic Algorithm was scripted in MATLAB and combined with the HFSS simulator, providing an easy optimisation tool across the operational bandwidth for the array unit cell design parameters. The proposed antenna shows a wide-scanning ability with a low cross-polarisation level over a wide bandwidth. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} the fabrication and operation of reconfigurable microwave devices that incorporate emerging materials such as liquid metals and dielectric fluids, in order to foster a more effective collaboration between the material science and microwave engineering communities. This goal is accomplished by outlining the design, fabrication, and measurement processes of a few prototype devices. The first device is a series stub-based microwave band-stop filter that uses dielectric fluids in a 3 D-printed channel to change the effective length of the filter stubs to enable frequency reconfigurability. A method for using the reconfigurable properties of the filter to determine the dielectric constant of the fluid is also developed and evaluated. The same band-stop filter design is modified by replacing the fixed copper stubs with an acrylic channel filled with eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) to allow the physical length of the stubs to change dynamically as a mechanism for frequency reconfigurability. Another device presented in this work is a stretchable microstrip patch antenna made from silver thermoplastic polyurethane (AgTPU) printed on spandex. Stretching the spandex material changes the physical length of the patch to reconfigure the operating frequency. A simulation of the antenna shows that stretching only the half of the <b>antenna</b> with the <b>feedline</b> results in a better impedance match compared to when stretching the whole antenna. The last device presented is a patch antenna with a flexible, integrated pumping mechanism {{that can be used}} to drive fluid networks that enable frequency reconfigurability...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} and development effort now underway is directed toward satisfying requirements for {{a new type of}} relatively inexpensive, lightweight, microwave antenna array and associated circuitry packaged in a thin, flexible sheet that can readily be mounted on a curved or flat rigid or semi-rigid surface. A representative package of this type consists of microwave antenna circuitry embedded in and/or on a multilayer liquid- crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. The circuitry typically includes an array of printed metal microstrip patch antenna elements and their feedlines on {{one or more of the}} LCP layer(s). The circuitry can also include such components as electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches for connecting and disconnecting <b>antenna</b> elements and <b>feedlines.</b> In addition, the circuitry can include switchable phase shifters described below. LCPs were chosen over other flexible substrate materials because they have properties that are especially attractive for high-performance microwave applications. These properties include low permittivity, low loss tangent, low water-absorption coefficient, and low cost. By means of heat treatments, their coefficients of thermal expansion can be tailored to make them more amenable to integration into packages that include other materials. The nature of the flexibility of LCPs is such that large LCP sheets containing antenna arrays can be rolled up, then later easily unrolled and deployed. Figure 1 depicts a prototype three- LCP-layer package containing two four-element, dual-polarization microstrip-patch arrays: one for a frequency of 14 GHz, the other for a frequency of 35 GHz. The 35 -GHz patches are embedded on top surface of the middle [15 -mil (approx. 0. 13 -mm) -thick] LCP layer; the 14 - GHz patches are placed on the top surface of the upper [9 -mil (approx. 0. 23 -mm) -thick] LCP layer. The particular choice of LCP layer thicknesses was made on the basis of extensive analysis of the effects of the thicknesses on cross-polarization levels, bandwidth, and efficiency at each frequency...|$|R
40|$|The reflectarray {{has been}} {{considered}} as a suitable candidate to replace the conventional parabolic reflectors because of its high-gain, low profile, and beam reconfiguration capability. Beam scanning capability and multi-band operation of the microstrip reflectarray have been main research topics in the reflectarray design. Narrow bandwidth of the reflectarray is the main obstacle for the various uses of the reflectarray. The wideband antenna element with a large phase variation range and a linear phase response {{is one of the}} solutions to increase the narrow bandwidth of the reflectarray. A four beam scanning reflectarray has been developed. It is the offset-fed microstrip reflectarray that has been developed to emulate a cylindrical reflector. Unlike other microstrip reflectarrays which integrates phase tuning devices such as RF MEMS switches and another phase shifters to the reflectarray elements and control the reflected phase, the beam scanning capability of the reflectarray is implemented by a phased array feed antenna. This method can reduce the complexity of the design of the beam switching reflectarray. A simple method has been investigated to develop multi-band elements in this dissertation. In approach to increase the coverage of the operation bands, a six-band reflectarray has been developed with two layers. Each layer covers three frequency bands. A Butler matrix is one of the useful beamforming networks for a phased array antenna. A Double-Sided Parallel-Strip Line (DSPSL) is adapted for the feeding network of eight array elements. The DSPSL operate very well to feed the microstrip antenna array over the bandwidth to reduce the sidelobe level and a high gain. In another topic of a Butler matrix, a dual-band Butler matrix has been proposed for multi-band applications. A modified Butler matrix is used to reduce a size and a sidelobe level. The bandwidth of the microstrip antenna is inherently small. A broadband circularly polarized microstrip <b>antenna</b> with dual-offset <b>feedlines</b> is introduced in this dissertation. Aperture-coupled feed method is used to feed the stacked patch antennas and a slotcoupled directional coupler is used for the circularly polarized operation. The research presented in this dissertation suggests useful techniques for a beam scanning microstrip reflectarray, phased array antenna, and wideband antenna designs in the modern wireless communication systems...|$|R
