5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care,</b> their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E

Lavelli and two teammates, Abe Gibron and George Ratterman, met every Wednesday to discuss the union. They approached Creighton Miller, a Cleveland lawyer and former Notre Dame star who had worked briefly as an assistant coach with the Browns, for help. The union was founded at a meeting before the NFL championship game in 1956. The following year, the players got $50 per exhibition game, a $5,000 minimum salary, injury pay <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> The union is now the primary representative of players in labor negotiations and disputes with the NFL.|$|E
