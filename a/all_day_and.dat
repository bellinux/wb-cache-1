The voting lasted for a long time, and the result was to dismiss the Viceroy by a large majority: 155votes to69.|$|E

Piłsudski drove himself hard, working <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.

5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock {{found himself in a}} {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E

Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Meyer and {{his friend}} Denny Martin Flinn wrote the {{screenplay}} by the nascent means of e-mail; Meyer lived in Europe while Flinn was based in Los Angeles. The pair worked out a system where Flinn would write <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> then send the draft to Meyer, who would read and make revisions. The script constantly changed because of demands made {{not only by the}} core cast, but also the supporting players. Flinn was aware that the film would be the last to feature the cast of the original television series, so he wrote an opening that embraced the passage of time. In the opening, each of the crew was to be rounded up out of unhappy retirement for one final mission.|$|E

Early next day, in misty weather, he took him through the German wire and, leaving him {{in a place of}} {{comparative}} safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other.

5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> his crew returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E

5|$|The assault {{began at}} {{daylight}} on 27 March; the 8th Squadron {{moved across the}} plain to Kusr, where their progress was stopped by heavy Turkish small arms fire. The squadron formed a defensive line, while the 1st Squadron moved past them {{on the right and}} captured a small hill. Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire grew heavier <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> another attempt by the 8th Squadron to move forward at 16:00 also failed. At 19:25 the Turks counter-attacked the 1st Squadron, but were forced to retire. That night patrols were sent to reconnoitre the Turkish positions, so they could be more easily attacked the next day. At dawn on 28 March the entire division tried another attack. The 1st Squadron managed to capture a small trench, but without their artillery support they were unable to move any further forward in the face of heavy Turkish machine-gun fire. All that day and night they managed to hold onto what they had won, waiting for reinforcement to continue the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{unprecedented}} rainfall {{turned the}} Chena River into a torrent. On August 14, it passed flood stage {{and continued to}} rise. Because no hydrological equipment had been installed upstream of Fairbanks, residents were unaware of the flood's scale. <b>All</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night on August 14, the water rose. It inundated the A-67 site and volunteers allowed water to fill the hold of the SS Nenana {{to keep it from}} floating on the rising waters and damaging buildings. In downtown Fairbanks, hundreds of volunteers built a sandbag dike around St. Joseph's Hospital to no avail. As the water crested the emergency dike, doctors, nurses, and patients evacuated to the University of Alaska on College Hill.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the civil}} war was over, Gia Long decided {{to add to the}} two citadels that had been built under the {{supervision}} of French officers. Gia Long was convinced of their effectiveness and during his 18-year reign, a further 11 citadels were built throughout the country. The majority were built in the Vauban style, with pentagonal or hexagonal geometry, while a minority, including the one in Huế, were built in a four-sided traditional Chinese design. The fortresses were built at Vinh, Thanh Hóa, Bắc Ninh, Hà Tĩnh, Thái Nguyên and Hải Dương in the north, Huế, Quảng Ngãi, Khánh Hòa and Bình Định in the centre, and Vĩnh Long in the Mekong Delta. Construction was at its most intense in the early phase of Gia Long's reignonly one of the 11 were built {{in the last six years}} of his rule. De Puymanel and Lebrun left Vietnam before the end of the war, so the forts were designed by Vietnamese engineers who oversaw the construction. The position of Citadel Supervision Officer was created under the Ministry of War and made responsible for the work, underlining the importance that Gia Long placed on fortifications. Gia Long's fortifications program was marred by accusations that the people labored <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> part of the night in all weather conditions, and that as a direct consequence, land went fallow. Complaints of mandarin corruption and oppressive taxation were often levelled at his government. Following his coronation, Gia Long drastically reduced his naval fleet and by the 1810s, only two of the European-style vessels were still in service. The downsizing of the navy was mainly attributed to budgetary constraints caused by heavy spending on fortifications and transport infrastructure such as roads, dykes and canals. However, in 1819, a new phase of shipbuilding was launched, with Gia Long personally supervising the dockyards.|$|E

5|$|At {{daylight}} 4th Parachute Brigade {{started moving}} east towards the division at Oosterbeek, where the KOSB, {{moving through the}} night, had already arrived. Only the parachute battalions and brigade troops remained outside of the village. The order of march was 10 Para followed by brigade troops then 156 Para bringing up the rear. Virtually surrounded, the brigade fought a running hand-to-hand battle with German infantry supported by armour as they attempted to break through. During the fighting commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Des Voeux and the second in command of 156 Para were killed in action. Another high ranking casualty was the commanding officer of 10 Para Lieutenant-Colonel Ken Smyth, who was wounded and became a prisoner of war. With 156 Para leading, {{the remnants of the}} brigade carried out a bayonet charge and cleared the Germans from a large hollow which provided some shelter for the exhausted troops.

5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request {{the assistance of}} the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesars crew worked <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.|$|E
