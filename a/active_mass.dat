For the design of new buildings to include <b>active</b> thermal <b>mass</b> strategies, experience from operational projects and design guidelines are normally used by engineers.

5000|$|<b>Active</b> {{gravitational}} <b>mass</b> is {{a measure}} of the strength of an object's gravitational flux (gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface). Gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small [...] "test object" [...] to fall freely and measuring its free-fall acceleration. For example, an object in free fall near the Moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field, and hence accelerates more slowly, than the same object would if it were in free fall near the Earth. The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less <b>active</b> gravitational <b>mass.</b>|$|R
