50|$|The {{training}} program was again extended to 24 weeks in October 1944, but {{this led to}} problems with {{the availability of the}} M-38A2 practice bombs. At the time, trainees were required to drop 20 practice bombs each per month, and students normally dropped as many as 200. However, due to a shortage of practice bombs, this was reduced to a maximum of 125. Some of the major additional to the course was the extension of flying time from 120 to 150 hours. Academic hours were increased in the ground school to study bomb racks and their in-flight maintenance, fuses, bombs, bombing analysis, radio navigation aids, glide bombing, and other subjects. Also, a 10-hour course was added {{in the use of the}} <b>Astro-Compass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Cologne raid of 1/2 February 1943 nearly brought Mahaddie's RAF {{career to}} an end. After {{releasing}} his target marking flares, the cloud cover {{that had been}} providing some protection that night broke up, and his aircraft was hit with flak. At nearly the same time his aircraft was attacked by a Ju 88 night-fighter, which raked its fuselage with cannon fire. Mahaddie initiated a diving turn to starboard, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft slipping into a steep, violent diving turn. Altitude was being lost at an alarming rate, and he realized he had lost lateral control of the aircraft. As they were diving under full power, Mahaddie made a grab for the throttle controls to pull them back. Fortunately, he only reached the two port throttles, and as he brought back power on them the aircraft leveled off. The instrument panel had been wrecked, the rear turret was put out of action and the Stirling's intercom system was knocked out. The mid-upper gunner, wireless operator and bomb aimer were all injured, most of the compasses and navigational equipment were destroyed and the aileron controls were severed. According to gunner Bob Pointer, [...] "the skipper was fighting with the aircraft. Having had the aileron controls badly mangled by the cannon shells he could only fly the aircraft by varying the power of the engines." [...] He attempted to regain the altitude lost and came up through a cloud bank to realize they were headed east instead of west. By manipulating the power on the four engines he was able to lurch the aircraft back toward home. Flight Sergeant Stewart treated the wounds of the three injured crew members. Meanwhile, using star sightings and the plane's <b>astro-compass,</b> navigator [...] "Tommy" [...] Thompson was able to provide Mahaddie with a bearing back to base, if he could control the aircraft. Reaching the wing root with a flashlight and some wire, the flight engineer was able to jury rig a splice over the airloin wires, giving Mahaddie partial control of [...] "C" [...] Charlie, and he set course for home." [...] However, their troubles were not over. Half way to the coast a second night fighter located the aircraft and closed, but Mahaddie was able to evade and shake him off, though the splicing of the ailerons did not hold up to his maneuvers and for a time he was limited to controlling direction with the throttle controls again. The next morning revealed the aircraft had taken 174 cannon shell hits. Said Mahaddie, [...] "We went out flying C-Charlie, and came back flying C-Colander." [...] Shells had past through through the cockpit either side of Mahaddie's seat, making a mess of the instruments. One round punched through the armour plate below the pilot, but the parachute Mahaddie was using as a seat cushion absorbed the rest of the rounds energy, leaving a mark on the pilot's buttock [...] "no bigger than the size of a sixpence". Lucky to have survived, he said the event may have just proved the ancient Scot axiom [...] "The deil looks after his ain!" ...|$|E
