5|$|The Imperial Order of the Lion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> instituted by Fat’h Ali Shah of the Qajar Dynasty in 1808 to honour foreign {{officials}} (later {{extended to}} Persians) who had rendered distinguished services to Persia.|$|E
5|$|Najmabadi observes a {{parallel}} symbolism on wall hangings produced between the lion/sun and Reza Khan/motherland, after Reza Khan's successful coup. The coy sun {{is protected by}} the lion and Rezakhan is the hero who should protect the motherland. Under Reza Shah the sun's female facial features were removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> portrayed more realistically and merely with rays. In the military contexts the Pahlavi crown {{was added to the}} motif.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E

5|$|The last {{of these}} {{may have been}} in 217 BC. There were {{earthquakes}} in Italy during that year <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> reported as being dimmed by gray haze or dry fog. Plutarch wrote of the sky being on fire near Naples and Silius Italicus mentioned in his epic poem Punica that Vesuvius had thundered and produced flames worthy of Mount Etna in that year, although both authors were writing around 250 years later. Greenland ice core samples of around that period show relatively high acidity, which is assumed to have been caused by atmospheric hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 1590, the German {{astronomer}} Michael Maestlin observed an occultation of Mars by Venus. One of his students, Johannes Kepler, {{quickly became}} an {{adherent to the}} Copernican system. After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, Tycho Brahe. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> located {{at one of the}} foci. His model became the basis for Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which were published in his multi-volume work Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.|$|E
25|$|Early Sunday morning, {{the wind}} and snow {{decreased}} somewhat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> seen at times.

It promoted the FIFA World Cup 2014, and {{was used in the}} American action comedy film Spy (2015) and the dance video game Just Dance 2017. Inna's follow-up single, 2014's [...] "Good Time" [...] in collaboration with Pitbull, was featured on the American sitcom Young & Hungry and the American film Pitch Perfect 2. She released her fourth, eponymous studio album in October 2015. Another version of the album, Body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>was</b> released in Japan in July 2015. Inna was the Best Romanian Act and was nominated for Best European Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards.

500|$|Kepler {{had found}} that the {{distance}} between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun, and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony, and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way. He had written in 1618, [...] "Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres". When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets (with the exception of Mars) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun, this being 28 arc seconds. This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true, and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> about 15,000 times its radius. Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles (97 million km), suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed. His figure was much lower than the 93million miles (150million km) that the Astronomical Unit is known to be today, but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} 1783 was the hottest on {{record and a}} rare {{high-pressure}} zone over Iceland caused the winds to blow to the south-east. The poisonous cloud drifted to Bergen in Denmark–Norway, then spread to Prague in the Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) by 17 June, Berlin by 18 June, Paris by 20 June, Le Havre by 22 June, and Great Britain by 23 June. The fog was so thick that boats stayed in port, unable to navigate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> described as [...] "blood coloured".|$|E

2500|$|Version 0.7.3 was {{the first}} public release of Kerbal Space Program, and was {{released}} on 24 June 2011. It was downloaded over 5,000 times. The version lacked many features present in later versions, such as a stability assist mode. Kerbin did not rotate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> simply a directional light source. There were no fuel flow mechanics, no control surfaces, and no other celestial bodies. Later versions added additional planets and moons, {{as well as the}} ability to load and save collections of parts, known as [...] "subassemblies". Tutorials were also added at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|The present Seven Network {{began as}} a group of {{independent}} stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. HSV-7 Melbourne, licensed to The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd (owners of two local papers at the time, The Herald <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun),</b> <b>was</b> launched on 4 November 1956, the first station in the country to use the VHF7 frequency. ATN-7 Sydney, licensed to Amalgamated Television Services, a subsidiary of Fairfax, was launched on 2 December 1956. The two stations did not immediately share resources, and instead formed content-sharing partnerships with their VHF9 counterparts by 1957: ATN-7 partnered with Melbourne's GTV-9, while HSV-7 paired up with Sydney's TCN-9. TVW-7 Perth, licensed to TVW Limited, a subsidiary of West Australian Newspapers, publisher of The West Australian, began broadcasting almost two years later, on 16 October 1959, as the city's first commercial station. BTQ-7 Brisbane followed on 1 November, signing on as Brisbane's second commercial television station. ADS-7 Adelaide was launched on 24 October 1959 as the final capital city VHF7 station. The station later swapped frequencies with SAS-10, however, with the latter becoming SAS-7 ...|$|E
2500|$|In effect, {{this means}} that the [...] "tropical year" [...] on the moon is only 347 days long. This is called the draconic year or eclipse year. The [...] "seasons" [...] on the moon fit into this period. For about half of this draconic year, the sun is north of the lunar equator (but at most 1.543°), and for the other half it is south of the lunar equator. Obviously the effect of these seasons is very minor {{compared}} to the difference between lunar night and lunar day. At the poles, there are not days and nights of about 15 Earth days, but rather the sun will be [...] "up" [...] for 173 days at a time. [...] "Up" [...] here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon. The sunrise and sunset at the poles each take about 18 days. These polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses (solar or lunar). For example, at the Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016, the moon was near its descending node, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic. When the sun reached that point, the centre of the sun set at the north pole and rose at the south pole.|$|E
