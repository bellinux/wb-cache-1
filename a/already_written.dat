5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are <b>already</b> <b>written</b> as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E

5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had <b>already</b> <b>written</b> a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote ‚Äì Licence to Kill and GoldenEye ‚Äì were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Carey was {{discovered}} by Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records, and was promptly signed to the label.
