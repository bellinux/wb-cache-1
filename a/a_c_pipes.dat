50|$|Some pitch pipes are {{intended}} for tuning string instruments, and only provide reeds for notes appropriate to a particular instrument. Chromatic pitch pipes are favored by a cappella singers and timpanists. Chromatic pipes most often provide thirteen pitches, each a half step above the previous. By providing all of the notes of a single octave, a singer can start in any key called for in Western music. Different pipes are available for bass and treble voices due to the differences in vocal range: male singers most often use F-F pipes, while female singers favor C-C pipes. However, it is particularly notable that the Men's pipe in F is pitched higher than the Women's <b>C</b> <b>pipe.</b> Pipes in other keys are available, but are much more rare.|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{dispersed}} flow of viscous {{oil and water}} is investigated. The experimental work was performed in a 26. 2 -mm-i. d. 12 -m-long horizontal glass pipe using water and oil (viscosity of 100 mPa s and density of 860 kg/m(3)) as test fluids. High-speed video recording and a new wire-mesh sensor based on capacitance (permittivity) measurements were used to characterize the flow. Furthermore, holdup data were obtained using quick-closing-valves technique (QCV). An interesting finding was the oil-water slip ratio greater than one for {{dispersed flow}} at high Reynolds number. Chordal phase fraction distribution diagrams and images of the holdup distribution over the pipe cross-section obtained via wire-mesh sensor indicated {{a significant amount of}} water near to the pipe wall for the three different dispersed flow patterns identified in this study: oil-in-water homogeneous dispersion (o/w H), oil-in-water non-homogeneous dispersion (o/w NH) and Dual continuous (Do/w & Dw/o).

5000|$|In oilsand {{extraction}} plants, the froth {{is formed}} {{to remove the}} bitumen and it is called oilsand froth. Oilsand froth is difficult to pump at very low speeds and at low temperatures. However above a certain speed in a steel pipe, water may separate and form a lubrication layer. The process is called self-lubrication and depending on the temperature (25 C - 45 C), the friction losses are between 10 and 20 times the equivalent friction losses of water. When entering a centrifugal pump, a low pressure forms at {{the eye of the}} impeller. Pre-rotation creates centrifugal forces that push the dense slurry towards the wall of the pipe while leaving a core of air at the center. According to Abulnaga (2004), the froth pump may use-( [...] a) a very large eye diameter - (b) an inducer or having the impeller vanes extend into the suction pipe- (<b>c)</b> <b>a</b> recirculating <b>pipe</b> from the discharge side of the pump with pressurized froth to break up the bubbles at the eye- (d) tandem vanes at the impeller shroud- (e) split or secondary vanes at the shroud- (f) vertical arrangement,thus:The split vanes in a slurry pump must be thick enough to resist continuous wear.thus: ...|$|R

50|$|The pitch {{produced}} by an organ pipe is determined in two fundamentally different ways. For a reed pipe it is determined mainly by the mechanical {{properties of the}} reed {{and the length of}} the protruding part. For the flue pipes it is determined by the shape of the air column inside the pipe and whether the column is open at the end.For those pipes the pitch is a function of its length, the wavelength of the sound {{produced by}} an open pipe being approximately twice its length. A pipe half the length of another will sound one octave higher. If the longest <b>pipe,</b> <b>C,</b> is 8 ft in length, the pipe one octave higher will be 4 ft long, and two octaves above (middle C) will be 2 ft long. A closed (stopped) pipe produces a sound one octave lower than an open pipe. For example, the lowest Gedackt / closed <b>C</b> <b>pipe</b> (2 octaves below middle C) will be 4 ft long.|$|R
