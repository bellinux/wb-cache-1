500|$|The young {{actress who}} {{originally}} played Emily {{was terrified of}} the hospital setting in this episode, {{and as a result}} the producers had to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring her in the previous episode [...] "Christmas Carol". Director Kim Manners recalls, [...] "I called Bob Goodwin and said, 'We're dead in the water here, pal. This little actress is not cooperating at all'. We recast that role <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> again the next day." [...] The show's casters replaced her with Lauren Diewold, who had previously appeared on an episode of Millennium. Due to the show's shooting schedule, the producers were unable to use Gillian Anderson to reshoot the previous episode's scenes, resulting in Anderson's double being used instead, with the footage pieced together in the editing room.|$|E

500|$|A raid on Amman was {{the next}} {{operation}} for the regiment. The ANZAC Mounted Division, 60th (London) Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade would all take part. On 13 March the regiment started back to the Jordan Valley through heavy rain. Orders for the raid were issued; the brigade would advance on mountain tracks, via the village of Ain Es Sir, then to Amman. The rains postponed the raid, {{and it was not}} until 01:30 on 24 March that the brigade crossed the river Jordan, by a pontoon bridge at Hajlah. At 09:30 the regiment, the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade started clearing the area between the river and the foothills. The vanguard, formed by the 1st Squadron and the Auckland Mounted Rifles, had by 16:30 left the Wadi Jeria <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> into the hills. In the wet and cold weather progress was slow. The narrow tracks meant that all wheeled transport, including artillery and supply wagons, had to be left behind. They reached Ain Es Sir at 14:00, two hours behind the vanguard. Out of contact with the division, they remained at the village for the remainder of that day and the next. Patrols checked the area between the village and Amman, which was around [...] away. The remainder of the division, which had travelled by a different route, arrived later that day. They were in no physical condition to attack, so the advance was postponed until the next day.|$|E
