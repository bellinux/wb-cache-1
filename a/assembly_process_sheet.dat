40|$|Ecological theory {{suggests}} that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species' assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> We focus on four <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species' distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) {{a broad range of}} diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different <b>assembly</b> <b>processes,</b> 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Our study supports the inference of <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence...|$|R

The {{aim was to}} study the feasibility of {{the combination of the}} friction stir processing technique with the superplastic forming process.

Thus, much attention has been on the work of the assembly operator. However, little focus has been devoted to how the new requirements from lean production have been transformed into materials supply systems supporting the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Hence, the purpose of this thesis is to contribute to increased knowledge about the relation between <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> and materials supply systems design. A framework is introduced in this thesis, describing how requirements from the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> are transformed by the materials supply system into the actual materials flow. In the results of this thesis, a model structuring requirements in materials supply and <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> is proposed, tested, and subsequently different requirements were identified.

Results show that that the materials exposure has a large impact on assembly workstations performance in terms of space needed, non-value-adding work and ergonomics. Further, an experiment showed that the materials exposure factors with the largest impact on picking time were packaging, angle of packaging and height above floor. Major contributions in this thesis are the identification and structuring of requirements in <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> and materials supply systems, and explaining how the materials exposure affects the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> How this knowledge can be applied in the design of new, or redesign of existing, production systems and materials supply processes in particular, is a managerial contribution...|$|R

We studied the relationships between fragmentation and community <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> in the land-bridge island system of Thousand Island Lake in East China. We focused on the changes in species diversity and phylogenetic diversity that occurred between life stages of woody plants growing on these islands. The observed diversities were compared with the expected diversities from random null models to characterize <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Regression tree analysis was used to illustrate the relationships between island attributes and community <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> We found that different <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> predominate in the seedlings-to-saplings life-stage transition (SS) vs. the saplings-to-trees transition (ST).

The <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> reported created {{a large number of}} voids among solder interconnects in FCIP. The voids formed among solder interconnections can propagate, grow, and produce defects such as solder joint cracking and solder bridging. Moreover, these voids can severely reduce reliability performance. Indeed, many studies were conducted to examine the void formation in FCIP. Based on the studies, flip chip geometric design, process conditions, and material formulation have been considered as the potential causes of void formation. However, the present research won't be able to identify the mechanism of void formation, causing a lot of voids in <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> without consideration of chemical reaction in the <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> with a fine-pitch, high I/O density FCIP. Therefore, this research will present process technology necessary to achieve high yields in FCIP assemblies using no-flow underfills and investigate the underlying problem of underfill void formation in these assemblies. The plausible causes of void formation will be investigated using experimental techniques. The techniques will identify the primary source of the void formation. Besides, theoretical models will be established to predict the number of voids and to explain the growth behavior of voids in the FCIP. The established theoretical models will be verified by experiments. These models will validate with respect to the relationship between process parameters to achieve a high yield and to minimize voids in FCIP assemblies using no-flow underfill materials regarding process as well as material stand points.
