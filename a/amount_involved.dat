25|$|The {{breaches}} of {{the salary}} cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the AFL are: exceeding the TPP; falling below the salary floor; not informing the AFL of payments; late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents; or engaging in draft tampering. Penalties include fines of up to triple the <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> ($10,000 for each document late or incorrect lodged or lost), forfeiture of draft picks and/or deduction of premiership points. The most significant breach of {{the salary cap}} {{was that of the}} Carlton Football Club in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|The cap is {{actively}} policed and penalties for clubs {{found to have}} breached the NRL salary cap regulations include fines of lesser of half the <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> or $500,000 and/or deduction of premiership points. For example, six clubs were fined for minor infractions in 2003. These infractions are usually technical in nature, and can sometimes be affected by third-party factors such as loss of sponsorship revenue affecting an allowance. During the 2007 season the NRL implemented ways of creating a fair and more beneficial cap for players and clubs.|$|E

This feature is fundamental when the <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> in the transactions are large. However, as mentioned in [36, 37], in purchase transactions where it is expected that the <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> will be small or very small (micropayments) as in our payment system, non-repudiation could be considered unnecessary in order to save some computations and perform the transactions more efficiently.|$|R

500|$|If Hurcomb {{persisted in}} {{adhering}} to his {{terms of reference}} and approved the power station, but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent {{on the grounds of}} the objections, NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site. [...] The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of the question that they would be able to afford the large <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves. [...] If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to do just that. [...] Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed. The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times, and Frank Tribe, secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, wrote to Hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring the inquiry to a decision.|$|E

50|$|The {{level of}} evasion {{depends on a}} number of factors, {{including}} the amount of money a person or a corporation possesses. Efforts to evade income tax decline when the <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> are lower. The level of evasion also depends on the efficiency of the tax administration. Corruption by tax officials make it difficult to control evasion. Tax administrations use various means to reduce evasion and increase the level of enforcement: for example, privatization of tax enforcement or tax farming.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of the tax agent as a {{preparer}} of tax returns and provider of professional tax advice under a system based on self-assessment principles. In particular it recognises the competing pressures under which tax agents attempt to discharge their professional responsibilities, and the implications for potentially unethical behaviour. Empirical research into taxpayer attitudes suggests that the risk of audit, the severity of tax law and the materiality of dollar <b>amounts</b> <b>involved,</b> will all impact on the decision making process. This paper extends these principles from taxpayer to tax agent, by seeking their response to alternative client demands as represented in realistic tax return scenarios. The findings suggest that the severity of tax law violation is an important factor in ethical decision making, but that audit risk and the <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> are not. The lack of support for audit risk as an influential variable is an important outcome, because policy makers have traditionally proceeded on the basis that increases in audit probabilities will reduce the likelihood of taxpayers adopting aggressive tax reporting positions. The implications are that alternative enforcement and compliance strategies must be considered by tax administrators. ...|$|R

Thus, according to Chancellor Angela Merkel, German participation in rescue efforts is conditioned on negotiation of Eurozone reforms which have the potential to resolve the underlying imbalances which are driving the crisis.|$|R
