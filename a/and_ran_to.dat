5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State Sanatorium {{was opened}} on September 1, 1907, to treat adult {{patients}} with tuberculosis. Children were later treated there starting in 1915. After 1955 the hospital also handled patients with mental illnesses. In 1961 the sanatorium became the Howell State Hospital, {{and later the}} Hillcrest Center in 1978. The facility operated until September 30, 1982, when it was closed. and the building finally demolished a few years after. M-155 was designated in 1931; it began at the hospital <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> a junction with US Highway16 (modern BL I-96) in Howell. After the hospital was abandoned, the trunkline designation remained on the road, serving a field. The designation last appeared on official state maps in 1991. The highway remains an unsigned trunkline.|$|E
5|$|The seeming {{failure of}} the RAAF <b>and</b> <b>RAN</b> <b>to</b> {{cooperate}} to finish off a damaged submarine led Royle to order an inquiry into the attack. This found that a breakdown in communication between the two services was {{the main cause of}} the failure, with both the aircraft and the naval signal room in Sydney making procedural errors. Rear Admiral Gerard Muirhead-Gould, the naval officer in command of the Sydney region, also noted that communications between the RAN and RAAF were unsatisfactory at higher levels, and that the communication procedures to be used in anti-submarine operations were not well known or understood. In response, he suggested that the RAN establish the position of Commander Escort Vessels Group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 213 was designated to run from the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The route headed west from Ocean City through Berlin and Salisbury (where it intersected its parent route US 13), before it turned northwest to Mardela Springs. Here, US 213 turned to the north <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> Eldorado, where it continued northwest through Hurlock and Preston to Easton. From Easton, the route continued north to Wye Mills and followed the present alignment of MD 213 to Elkton. A new Dover Bridge over the Choptank River east of Easton, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and {{returned}} it to the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo threw his second interception of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart returned to the game for Tennessee's offense. James Stewart took the first play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the five-yard line for a first down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass to tight end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough for a first down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 {{to go in the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-48 {{ran from}} Rexton to Trout Lake and eastward on to Rudyard. The highway {{continued}} to Goetzville <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> DeTour Village {{at the eastern}} tip of the UP. By 1927, the western end was moved to a point north of Newberry. M-48 was extended along US Highway 2 (US2) to Garnet. From there, M-48 ran north to M-28 east of Newberry. It turned west along M-28 into Newberry and then north to Four Mile Corner. In the mid-1930s, M-28's routing through the Newberry area was shifted. As {{a result of this}} shift, the section of M-28/M-48 in downtown was renumbered M-28A/M-48. In the early 1940s, US2 was moved to a new routing along the Lake Michigan shoreline. In the process, the US2/M-48 concurrency was eliminated. By the same time, M-48 was truncated when M-134 was designated east to the DeTour area. By the end of the decade, M-48 was truncated and rerouted on its western end, replacing the contemporary M-117 south of Rexton to US2 in Epoufette. All of M-48 west of US2 was turned over to local jurisdiction and removed from the state highway system, save a section made part of M-123 in late 1960 or early 1961. A few years later, M-48 was extended along a former section of US2 into Rudyard to connect to the newly opened I-75/US2 freeway in 1963. After October 1970, the former M-48 west of the current highway was designated {{as a part of the}} County-Designated Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
