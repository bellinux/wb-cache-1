5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hard liquor.|$|E

25|$|A flood is an {{overflow}} of <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{water that}} reaches land. Floods occur usually when {{the volume of}} water within a body of water, such as a river or lake, exceeds the total capacity of the formation, {{and as a result}} some of the water flows or sits outside of the normal perimeter of the body. However, floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes, if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.|$|E

25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for Parcel Post service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the Parcel Post separate. The twelve Parcel Post stamps had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the Parcel Post denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|E
25|$|In {{each of the}} {{examples}} discussed so far the constituents have been miscible in all proportions with each other. For example, <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ethanol can be mixed with <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water to form a homogeneous solution. There are pairs of solvents for which {{this is not the}} case. For example, if equal volumes of chloroform (water solubility 0.8 g/100 ml at 20°C) and water are shaken together and then left to stand, the liquid will separate into two layers. Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water {{with a small amount of}} chloroform dissolved in it, and the bottom layer is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it. If the two layers are heated together, the system of layers will boil at 53.3°C, which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform (61.2°C) or the boiling point of water (100°C). The vapor will consist of 97.0% chloroform and 3.0% water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present (provided both layers are indeed present). If the vapor is re-condensed, the layers will reform in the condensate, and will do so in a fixed ratio, which in this case is 4.4% of the volume in the top layer and 95.6% in the bottom layer. Such a system of solvents is known as a heteroazeotrope. The diagram illustrates how the various phases of a heteroazeotrope are related.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Congress {{attempted}} {{to enhance the}} president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|After {{purchasing}} the card, the cardholder loads the account with <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money, {{up to the}} predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases {{the same way as}} a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.|$|E

With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E
25|$|Poses {{fall into}} three basic categories: standing, seated and reclining. Within {{each of these}} there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is not always easier than another.

Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical contrapposto are difficult to sustain accurately for <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model can do.

25|$|General Dyer made {{a series}} of three {{conflicting}} sets of statements about his motives and actions. At first, immediately after he carried out the massacre, he {{made a series}} of partial but slightly varying explanations with the aim of exonerating him from any blame. Later, after receiving approval for his actions from all his superiors in India, both civil and military, Dyer stated, that his actions were a deliberate attempt to punish people he believed were rebels and to make an example {{for the rest of the}} Punjab that would stop what he regarded as a rebellion. Finally, on his return to England in disgrace in 1920, Dyer's lawyers argued that his actions though deliberate & premeditated were justified because he was facing an insurrection and that, on those grounds, <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> firing was permissible.|$|E

25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of chance, they have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. Many investors try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests that at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E
25|$|Netflix {{has been}} one of the most {{successful}} dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> their paychecks in stock options.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{processes}} do not necessarily occur in a single environment, {{and do not necessarily}} occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although <b>any</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.|$|E
