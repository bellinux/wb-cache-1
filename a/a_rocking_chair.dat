5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting on the back of <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having him sit in the corner in <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair</b> for timeout, although {{a couple of times}} she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair.</b> Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E

500|$|... "Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and {{replaced}} another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and {{described as being}} [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is {{rocking back and forth}} on his horns, as though the horns are <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair.</b> However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.|$|E
500|$|Potter was {{an admirer}} of American author Joel Chandler Harris and created a series of plates in the 1890s for his Uncle Remus stories, {{possibly}} {{in an attempt to}} find career direction. So deep was her admiration, Lear speculates the scene of Miss Moppet wrapping her head in the duster comes from a similar scene in an Uncle Remus tale in which Br'er Fox [...] "feigns illness in <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> wrapped up with flannel". Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and, wanting not to show cruelty, she wrote of the kitten: [...] "She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant". Children's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories.|$|E

Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: [...] "It was {{important for me to}} meet the people who make baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than I have given them."

The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread.

2500|$|One {{aspect of}} these objects, both family memorabilia and handicrafts, {{is that they}} are for the most part one-of-a-kind.
