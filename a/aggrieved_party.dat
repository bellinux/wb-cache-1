40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on the position of <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties</b> and crime victims. In relation to Act 45 / 2013 Coll., effective from 1 August 2013, On Victims of Crimes, their position has been regulated in a single comprehensive document. The Act substantially amended the Code of Criminal Procedure, modified the previous rights of the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties</b> and introduced into the Code a new institute of interlocutory injunctions. The paper analyzes {{the rights of the}} victims and <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties.</b> Additionally, it endeavors to pinpoint the deficiencies in the current legislation. The first section analyzes the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties</b> as participants in criminal proceedings and their rights in different stages of the proceedings. This section then tries to map the options that the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties</b> have in choosing their attorneys, or a joint attorney, and when they can claim legal assistance free of charge or at a reduced cost. The section is focused on the process of court's decision making in the trial; on the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>party's</b> options of seeking relief through remedies; and on the special position of <b>aggrieved</b> <b>parties</b> as regards the diversion of criminal proceedings. The second section tries to define the victims of crimes, particularly vulnerable victims. The next chapter addresses the rights of crime [...] ...|$|R

500|$|For a {{decision}} by a body to be amenable to judicial review, United Kingdom and Singapore law requires the decision to have some public element, and not to relate exclusively to private law matters. The public element is determined by considering if the body's power stems from a legal source (the [...] "source test"), or if {{the nature of the}} body is that it is carrying out some public function (the [...] "nature test"). If the power exercised by a body has a legislative source, it will ordinarily be amenable to judicial review in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, but this is not an invariable rule and decisions without a sufficient public element will not be amenable to review. The latter is also the result when a body is regarded has having acted pursuant to a contract between it and the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>party,</b> rather than having exercised its statutory powers.|$|E

However, it was held in A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem (1989) that where there are two or more courts with jurisdiction over a matter, and an ouster clause merely limits the jurisdiction to one particular court, the ouster clause is valid as the <b>aggrieved</b> <b>party</b> is still left with an avenue to proceed with his or her claim: ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the industrialized}} world uses land {{registration}} systems for the transfer of land titles or interests in them. Under these systems, the government determines title ownership and encumbrances using its land registration; {{with only a few}} exceptions, the government's determination is conclusive. Governmental errors lead to monetary compensation to the person damaged by the error but that <b>aggrieved</b> <b>party</b> usually cannot recover the property. [...] The Torrens title system is the basis for land registration systems in several common law countries. [...] Nineteen jurisdictions in the United States, such as Minnesota and Massachusetts, adopted a form of this system between 1896 and 1917, however it fell out of favor after single judgement in Imperial County, CA, bankrupted the state's title indemnification fund, {{and the vast majority of}} U.S. states have opted for a system of document recording in which no governmental official makes any determination of who owns the title or whether the instruments transferring it are valid.|$|E
