5|$|Cho {{offered some}} of the {{earliest}} contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{sightings}} and <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> {{large and}} diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths caused by humans result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E

5|$|For random initial conditions, the {{boundaries}} between the trees formed in this way themselves shift in <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> random pattern, and trees frequently die out altogether. But {{by means of the}} theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which the trees all remain alive forever, the pattern of growth repeats periodically, and all of the clearings can be guaranteed to remain bounded in size.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter, <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> {{ordinary}} eleven-year-old boy, {{is actually}} a wizard and survivor of Lord Voldemort's attempted rise to power. Harry is rescued from his unkind Muggle relatives and takes his place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, {{where he and his}} friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone, which is being kept within the school.|$|E

Later, in Lexington, Tennessee, a truck driver named Ranheim shoots {{something}} in the dark as another UFO flies overhead. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the sighting the next day, but Ranheim is quickly let go by the uncooperative local authorities. In <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> inconsequential event, a woman briefly borrows Scully's pen before they leave Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the city's mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks.

Royce's lead begins to fray, however, as his own political machinations turn against him and Carcetti starts to highlight the city's crime problem. Carcetti is propelled to victory in the primary election.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E

5|$|The series {{takes place}} mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new {{locations}} were rarely introduced. The first four seasons {{of the show}} are set during <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> endless summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior {{high school in the}} fall and winter months.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully are called in to {{investigate}} when a team of loggers disappear without a trace. Initially suspecting eco-terrorism, the agents find themselves trapped by <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> ancient menace lurking in the woods.|$|E
5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and {{his sense of humor}} and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E

Ulysses is then approached by Eternity and takes a place at his side as a new cosmic entity. Later, Captain Marvel meets with the President of the United States and is offered unlimited resources to lead the superhero community into the future.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E

The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.|$|E

5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the first}} Test with John Snow and David Brown {{claiming}} 13 wickets between them. A draw followed in Lord's, but England won the final match in a dramatic fashion. The West Indies in <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> strong position of 219/3 required 84 runs for victory. They suffered a late innings collapse however as Butcher, Sobers and Lloyd fell within 16 minutes, which ultimately led to England winning by 30 runs to win the series 2–0. It seemed that England would begin to dominate the West Indies, {{with many of the}} key West Indian players such as Butcher, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith retiring in 1969. Illingworth would be the last England captain to win the Wisden Trophy for 31 years.|$|E
