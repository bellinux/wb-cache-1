500|$|In November 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, which {{clarified}} the earlier 1976 {{amendment to the}} Act authorizing BLM and the Forest Service to use helicopters and motor vehicles to round up and transport feral horses on public lands. The use of helicopters in roundups has been challenged by feral-horse advocates {{on the grounds that}} they are dangerous to the horses. In 2011, a case was brought before the U.S. District Court in Nevada, regarding a roundup in that state, alleging in part that helicopter pilots flew too close to horses. The judge in that case issued a temporary restraining order against the [...] "mistreatment of mustangs during BLM gathers", including inadequate distance between helicopters and animals.

40|$|Handling {{refers to}} how {{agricultural}} animals are touched, moved, and interacted with during husbandry procedures. Transport means when agricultural animals are moved by vehicles or vessel {{from one place}} to another.

40|$|Rats reared under {{isolation}} conditions from weaning {{present a}} number of behavioral changes compared to animals reared under social conditions (group housing). These changes include deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex to a loud sound. PPI refers to {{the reduction of the}} magnitude of the startle reflex when a relatively weak stimulus (the prepulse) precedes by an appropriate time interval the intense startle-elicing stimulus (the pulse). PPI is useful for studying sensorimotor integration. The present study evaluated the effect of handling on the impairment of PPI induced by isolation-rearing. Male Wistar rats (N = 11 - 15 /group) were housed in groups (5 per cage and handled three times a week) or isolated (housed individually) since weaning (21 days) for 10 weeks when they reach approximately 150 g. The isolated rats were divided into "minimally handled" <b>animals</b> (<b>handled</b> once a week for cleaning purposes only) or "handled" <b>animals</b> (<b>handled</b> three times a week). This handling consisted of grasping the rat by the tail and moving it to a clean cage (approximately 5 s). A statistically significant reduction (52 %) in the PPI test was found only in the isolated group with minimal handling while no difference was seen between grouped <b>animals</b> and isolated <b>handled</b> <b>animals.</b> These results indicate that isolation rearing causes disruption in the PPI at adult age, which serves as an index of attention deficit. This change in the sensory processing of information induced by post-weaning isolation can be prevented by handling during the development of the animal...|$|R

2500|$|Temple Grandin—a leading {{designer}} of <b>animal</b> <b>handling</b> systems—gives various research times for {{loss of consciousness}} via Kosher and Halal ritual slaughter and elaborates on what parts of the process she finds {{may or may not}} be cause for concern. Grandin observes that the way animals are handled and restrained prior to slaughter likely has a greater impact on their welfare than whether or not they are stunned. For this reason, [...] "under the leadership of Grandin, research into animal welfare during slaughter has shifted away from examination of different techniques of stunning to a focus on auditing the performance of actual slaughter plants operating under commercial conditions." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{nuisance}} wildlife control {{industry is}} rapidly expanding in New York State. To gain additional insight about this {{industry and the}} number of <b>animals</b> <b>handled,</b> we reviewed the 1989 - 90 annual logs submitted by Nuisance Wildlife Control Orators (NWC 0 s) to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The specific objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the number and species of different wildlife responsible for damage incidents, (2) the cause of damage complaints, (3) the disposition of <b>animals</b> <b>handled,</b> (4) the location of damage events (i. e., urban, suburban, rural), and (5) an estimate of the economic impact of the nuisance wildlife industry in Upstate New York. The Nuisance Wildlife Logs (NWLs) were examined for 7 urban and 7 rural counties (25. 5 % of Upstate counties), and these data were used to estimate total NWCO activity in DEC Regions 3 through 9 (excludes Long Island). Approximately 75 % of NWCOs licensed by DEC were active during 1989 - 90, and nearly 2, 800 complaints were handled in the 14 counties sampled. More than 90 % of complaints came from urban counties, and we estimated that NWC 0 s responded to more than 11, 000 calls in Upstate New York. At a conservative estimate of $ 35 /call, revenue generated by this industry exceeded $ 385, 000 annually. Six wildlife species accounted for 85 % of the nuisance complaints in urban and rural counties. During 1986 to 1993, the number of NWCOs licensed by DEC nearly quadrupled, and {{there is no indication that}} this trend will change in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Facilities {{designed}} for intensively raised animals trained to lead are {{not appropriate for}} <b>handling</b> extensively raised <b>animals</b> unaccustomed to close contact with people. The author provides information on facility design for both intensively and extensively raised livestock. Non-slip flooring in handling facilities is essential for all livestock. Cleats must be spaced on loading ramps for trucks or ships so that the hooves of the animals fit easily between them. Cleats spaced too far apart cause slipping and falling. In developing countries, building stationary ramps for vehicles of differing heights using concrete, wood or steel is recommended. Highly mechanised systems, such as hydraulic tailgate lifts, are not recommended in developing countries due to maintenance difficulties. The holding capacity for livestock shipping and receiving terminals should be designed to hold {{the largest number of}} <b>animals</b> <b>handled</b> on the busiest days.
