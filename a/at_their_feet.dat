5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E
25|$|Farhad-beg-yailaki {{lies on the}} {{southern}} Silk Road in the Kingdom of Khotan. Sir Mark Aurel Stein explored the remains of Buddhist shrines there which he dated from the fourth to sixth century AD. Stein discovered Buddha statues wearing robes with bright floral designs on which had piles of fabrics offered <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> in worship. Stein {{concluded that there was}} evidence of contact with many cultures in Farhad-beg-yailaki. Murals found there depicted two important Buddhist mythological figures, Hariti and Avalokitesvara, draped in cloth with Sassanian designs on.|$|E

50|$|The Austrians built {{impressive}} fortifications in the 1830s, using Carnot's ideas, at Verona in Italy. These {{consisted of}} massive ramparts with a Carnot wall <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b> In {{the same period}} the Russians used the walls in fortifying Warsaw. In Germany examples were built at Coblenz and Ulm.|$|R
50|$|Although quite widely known, the car gwyllt {{remained}} {{limited to}} the single quarry at Craig Ddu. This {{was due to the}} layout of the two main inclines: long enough to make the time-saving worthwhile, but also shallow enough to keep speed manageable and with a shallow run-out area <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
25|$|One classic {{approach}} is to deliver several short balls into the batsman's chest, forcing the batsman onto the back foot to defend with a high bat, and then fire in a fast yorker, aimed {{at the base of}} the stumps. If the batsman is expecting to play a high back foot defensive, the time it takes to shift their weight to play the ball <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> may just be enough for the delivery to surprise the batsman and cause him or her to panic, and thus cause the loss of their wicket.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' arrest. Eight statues {{tell the}} story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope in his hand and to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. Then we see Jesus and Judas and <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> Malchus who has fallen {{backward}} to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. Then we have three other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 56 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, Bragi recounts to Ægir how {{the gods}} killed Þjazi. Þjazi's daughter, Skaði, took a helmet, {{a coat of}} mail, and [...] "all weapons of war" [...] and {{traveled}} to Asgard, {{the home of the}} gods. Upon Skaði's arrival, the gods wished to atone for her loss and offered compensation. Skaði provides them with her terms of settlement, and the gods agree that Skaði may choose a husband from among themselves. However, Skaði must choose this husband by looking solely <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> Skaði saw a pair of feet that she found particularly attractive and said [...] "I choose that one; there can be little that is ugly about Baldr." [...] However, the owner of the feet turned out to be Njörðr.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} of an investigation of thickness variations along coronal loops observed with the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), using observations from ten loops selected from the SXT data. The quantitative results indicate that coronal X-ray loops do not expand. This contradicts the expectation that, if plasma loops coincide with magnetic loops, many loops must be significantly broader <b>at</b> <b>their</b> tops than <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> points. Possible interpretations of the obtained results are proposed...|$|R

500|$|Other {{forms of}} {{alternative}} rock {{developed in the}} UK during the 1980s. The Jesus and Mary Chain's sound combined the Velvet Underground's [...] "melancholy noise" [...] with Beach Boys pop melodies and Phil Spector's [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] production, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with techno and house music. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., C86 and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the formative influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and guitar effects pedals onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive created an overwhelmingly loud [...] "wash of sound" [...] that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press {{at the end of}} the decade along with the Madchester scene. Performing for the most part in The Haçienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as Happy Mondays and The Stone Roses mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.|$|E
2500|$|I {{thought is}} disgraceful that the Australian Rugby Union would not send its best team. But the blame cannot be laid <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> alone. The egotist coaches at Super 12 level {{did not want}} to {{jeopardise}} their Super 12 prospects by releasing any of their star players. So we took a team minus the top players in Australia. The ARU had the view that Australia should target winning a Super 12 title, via the Brumbies, Waratahs or Reds, rather than pooling the best of their resources for a tilt at the World Cup Sevens Crown. Just another example of the professional age.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{individuals}} to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was Albrecht Dürer, a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving [...] "The Four Witches", portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> {{as well as the}} devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world. Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the Canon Episcopi, in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.|$|E

2500|$|Elsie arrives joyfully for {{her wedding}} {{to the man}} she still knows as [...] "Leonard", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. [...] Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught {{over the loss of}} [...] "Leonard", does not turn to see his face. [...] He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute. [...] Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, [...] "Leonard", but he says that his heart is like a [...] "massive rock" [...] and claims her as his bride. [...] Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally {{recognises}} him as her adored one. [...] All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow. [...] Elsie [...] "drops a tear" [...] for Point, but turns back to her love. [...] As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to Haggard, in November 1984, {{when he was}} an {{associate}} pastor of Bethany World Prayer Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his confidant and mentor Danny Ost, a missionary to Mexico City, had a vision of Haggard founding his church in Colorado Springs. Accordingly, Haggard moved to Colorado shortly afterwards, and founded New Life Church. Initially, the 22 people who met in the basement of Haggard's house formed his church, which then grew to rented spaces in strip malls. Haggard was unconventional in his approach to ministering to people. Through random acts of kindness, Haggard would sometimes skip the morning offering and surprise needy people, like returning military personnel and single parents, with financial blessings by asking the congregation to lay money <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> as they {{stood in front of the}} congregation. After 22 years, New Life Church operated from a campus in northern Colorado Springs and had a congregation of 14,000. In 1993, during what Haggard describes as his [...] "first prayer journey," [...] he traveled with a group to Israel. They stood on the Mount of Olives, where Haggard claimed to have felt the Holy Spirit speak to him. [...] "From that time until now," [...] Haggard writes in The Life-Giving Church, [...] "apostolic power has blessed me. My only problems are with me— not with the enemy, not with circumstances, not with people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Stems, {{with new}} drummer David Shaw on board, {{spent most of}} 1986 touring to promote their EP. This {{included}} national tours supporting Flamin' Groovies and the Hoodoo Gurus. They also sought a label deal. Mushroom Records signed the band, and The Stems booked into Platinum Studios with producer Alan Thorne {{at the end of}} 1986. The recording process didn’t go smoothly, and stretched from the planned one month to three, with a new producer brought in to complete the record. At First Sight, Violets Are Blue was released in 1987, their first recording for The White Label. [...] The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian alternative charts and 34 on the mainstream charts. [...] It also received national and international critical acclaim and {{would be one of the}} best selling Australian albums of that year, despite the lack of commercial airplay in the corporate FM dominated '80s. Leaning toward a stronger pop sensibility, the album highlighed the talents of Dom Mariani and Richard Lane as skilled tunesmiths of the guitar pop genre. The album was nominated in the top 100 Australian albums of all time by Rolling Stone magazine and the title track [...] "At First Sight" [...] remains a bona fide Australian classic. 1987 also saw the band embark on another national tour and make appearances on national television, including playing the final episode of Countdown. In the same year, the lead single [...] "At First Sight" [...] also made the Young Einstein soundtrack. The band seemed to have the world <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> an album which went on to become the third top Australian album of 1987. Following the success of the album, there was an increase in interest in the band from overseas, particularly in Europe.|$|E

They shall rejoice, as they do that have a most potent, vexatious, and tormenting enemy lying dead <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> and as those that ride in triumph over them.

2500|$|On May 21, 2014, Smith {{appeared}} {{along with}} other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted {{under the guidance of}} the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
