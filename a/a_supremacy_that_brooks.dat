50|$|The supreme Spanish {{law is the}} Spanish Constitution of 1978, which {{regulates the}} {{functioning}} of public bodies and the fundamental rights of the Spanish people, {{as well as the}} organization and competencies of the different autonomous communities. The Constitution, as well as being directly applicable by the judiciary, enjoys <b>a</b> material <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> determines the rest of the laws in Spain.|$|R
50|$|Under Afonso Henriques (r. 1139-1185), {{the first}} king of Portugal {{and the founder}} of the Portuguese Kingdom, church and state were unified into a lasting and {{mutually}} beneficial partnership. To secure papal recognition of his country, Afonso declared Portugal a vassal state of the Pope, and was as such recognized in 1179 through the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. The King found the Church to be a useful ally as he drove the Moors towards the South. For its support of his policies, Afonso richly rewarded the Church by granting it vast lands and privileges in the conquered territories. The Church became the country's largest landowner, and its power came to be equal to that of the nobility, the military orders, and even, for a time, the Crown. But Afonso also asserted his supremacy over the Church, <b>a</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> — with various ups and downs — was maintained.|$|R
50|$|Put {{in another}} way, a {{business}} cluster is a geographical location where enough resources and competences amass reach a critical threshold, {{giving it a}} key position in a given economic branch of activity, and with a decisive sustainable competitive advantage over other places, or even <b>a</b> world <b>supremacy</b> in <b>that</b> field (e.g. Silicon Valley and Hollywood).|$|R
2500|$|On April 5, 1984, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote [...] "By 'gentlemen's agreement' (the {{statue of}} William Penn atop City Hall) remains highest. It is <b>a</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> must be maintained, for {{philosophical}} and aesthetic and, indeed, economic reasons - density caused by towering skyscrapers {{is one of}} the surest ways to render a downtown ruinously overbuilt while its fringes wither." [...] In 1990, the Inquirer took it all back, noting that Rouse transformed Philadelphia's skyline to near universal acclaim. In 1987, Paul Goldberger called One Liberty Place the best skyscraper Helmut Jahn has ever designed and the best skyscraper built in Philadelphia since the PSFS Building. Goldberger noted that [...] "The skyline of Philadelphia, far from being destroyed by One Liberty Place, is in fact given new life by this building. The skyline has been transformed from one of the flattest of any American city to one of the richest." [...] He praised the shape which he said [...] "strikes a remarkable balance between dignity and verve". He was critical that the building was too busy with too many panels and stripes, but acknowledge it was more restrained than other of Helmut Jahn's buildings.|$|R

50|$|In <b>a</b> {{struggle}} for <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> {{followed in the}} 6th/5th century BCE, the growing state of the Magadhas emerged as the predominant power in ancient India, annexing several of the Janapadas of the Majjhimadesa. A bitter line in the Brahmin Puranas laments that Magadhan emperor Mahapadma Nanda exterminated all Kshatriyas, none {{worthy of the name}} Kshatriya being left thereafter. This obviously refers to the Kasis, Kosalas, Kurus, Panchalas, Vatsyas and other neo-Vedic tribes of the east Panjab of whom nothing was ever heard except in the legend and poetry.|$|R
40|$|Giorgio Agamben {{defines the}} sacred man or Homo Sacer {{as one who}} is not worthy of sacrifice. Having lost all rights, the person is reduced to the non-human. In modern times, {{banishment}} or banning by the law occurs when a state of exception is sanctioned by <b>a</b> totalitarian <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> suspends judicial power. The state of exception does not lie within or outside {{the boundaries of the}} judicial order, but in a zone of indifference. The state of exception in which the norm is annulled represents the inclusion, which in turn captures the space in which law becomes suspended. Here, I discuss how the authorities in José Saramago's Blindness and The Cave function within the law of exception, confining and defining space, and ultimately marking the Homo Sacer.

5000|$|Sánchez Marco's success {{relied on}} {{alliance}} with the Carlists, who in the early 20th century achieved political domination in Navarre. Enjoying position which was to last until the late 1910s, they used to gain most parliamentary mandates available for the province and by means of alliances partially controlled the remaining ones. As venomous hostility between the Integrists and the Carlists gave way to rapprochement, the former were key beneficiaries of the Carlist alliance strategy, especially {{by means of the}} so-called [...] "second vote" [...] in Pamplona. When the party leader Ramón Nocedal died in 1907, his place in the city was offered to Sánchez Marco, the second most important Integrist in Navarre. This mechanism ensured his success in 3 consecutive electoral campaigns of 1907, 1910 and 1914. In case of 1910 the Carlist-Integrist alliance enjoyed such <b>a</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> no counter-candidate dared to challenge Sánchez Marco, who was declared victorious according to the notorious Article 29. Contemporary scholars count him among [...] "grupo de poder de la ciudad" [...] and member of the inter-related family cacique network.Though in the chamber Sánchez Marco remained member of a minuscule, 2-person Integrist opposition minority, he turned a rather restless deputy; he excelled in harassing governments during question sessions, engaging in debates and launching new motions, usually swiftly killed during the legislative process. His activity was mostly about siding with the Church, promoting religious interests and attempting to thwart liberal designs; its climax fell on the 1910 debates related to the so-called Ley del Candado, when he animated local Junta Católica de Defensa. He became known also promoting regional establishments and especially official usage of Basque and Catalan, admitting allegiance to [...] "nuestra lengua vascongada" [...] and protesting exclusivity of castellano in the public realm. Last but not least, a number of times he intervened in local Navarrese cases.|$|R
2500|$|In certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater {{powers to}} the states (or curtailed {{the powers of the}} central {{government}} more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a commerce clause, the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding internal improvements in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's general welfare clause prohibited protective tariffs (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of [...] "carry on the Government of the Confederate States" [...] rather than providing for the [...] "general welfare". State legislatures had the power to impeach officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a Necessary and Proper Clause and <b>a</b> <b>Supremacy</b> Clause <b>that</b> essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.|$|R
5|$|The {{religious}} {{houses were}} dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John's Gate, traditionally {{regarded as the}} boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell. John Houghton (later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton), Prior of Charterhouse, went to Thomas Cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking <b>an</b> oath of <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> would be acceptable to their communities. This resulted in their being flung into the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged — becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve.|$|R
5000|$|The provincial {{councils and}} the House of Representatives were [...] "locked into <b>a</b> battle of <b>supremacy</b> <b>that</b> would last for 20 years." [...] The 1852 {{constitution}} defined thirteen areas where law making {{was reserved for}} the House of Representatives: customs, post-office, shipping dues, lighthouses, weights and measures, currency, bankruptcy, judiciary, marriage, Crown lands and native land (i.e. lands held by Māori), criminal law, and inheritance law. For a variety of reasons, the provincial councils were {{more effective than the}} national Parliament. Initially, this was partially because Parliament was made up of strong personalities with strong and differing regional interests, who had no prior experience of acting for the greater good of the country as a whole. Consequently, the role of a provincial Superintendent was more highly regarded than those of Members of Parliament.|$|R
50|$|The Collectanea satis copiosa (Latin: ‘The Sufficiently Abundant Collections’) was a {{collection}} of scriptural, historical, and patristic texts that was compiled to provide royal propagandists with arguments justifying Henry VIII's personal and England's provincial independence from Rome. Likely compiled around 1530-1531 {{by a group of}} men including Thomas Cranmer and Edward Foxe, the Collectanea supplied the ideology behind the Royal <b>Supremacy.</b> <b>As</b> evidence <b>that</b> Kings of England historically had no superior on Earth—including the Pope—the Collectanea cited scripture, conciliar decrees, Anglo-Saxon laws, and numerous historical works, including texts by Bede, Matthew Paris, William of Malmesbury, and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Henry VIII's numerous annotations in the surviving manuscript show his direct engagement with the text and the arguments contained therein.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to {{challenge}} efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on <b>a</b> white <b>supremacy</b> campaign <b>that</b> returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss {{of the ability to}} vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.|$|R
50|$|In 466, as a {{condition}} of his Isaurian alliance, Leo married his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian Tarasicodissa, who took the name Zeno. When Leo died in 474, Zeno and Ariadne's younger son succeeded to the throne as Leo II, with Zeno as regent. When Leo II died later that year, Zeno became emperor. The end of the Western Empire is sometimes dated to 476, early in Zeno's reign, when the Germanic Roman general Odoacer deposed the titular Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus, but declined to replace him with another puppet.To recover Italy, Zeno could only negotiate with the Ostrogoths of Theodoric, who had settled in Moesia. He sent the gothic king to Italy as magister militum per Italiam ("commander in chief for Italy"). After the fall of Odoacer in 493, Theodoric, who had lived in Constantinople during his youth, ruled Italy on his own. Thus, by suggesting that Theodoric conquer Italy as his Ostrogothic kingdom, Zeno maintained at least <b>a</b> nominal <b>supremacy</b> in <b>that</b> western land while ridding the Eastern Empire of an unruly subordinate.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, there were 75 NOI centers across America. The Nation's {{leadership}} chose Wallace Muhammad, also known as Warith Deen Mohammad, the fifth of Elijah's sons—not Farrakhan—as the new Supreme Minister. At the time, Nation of Islam was founded upon the principles of self-reliance and black <b>supremacy,</b> <b>a</b> belief <b>that</b> mainstream Muslims consider heretical. He shunned his father's theology and black pride views, forging closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities {{in an attempt to}} transition the Nation of Islam into orthodoxy more similar to Sunni Islam. Under W. D. Mohammed's leadership, the Nation of Islam decentralized into many bodies of followers led by many different leaders. This made it hard to track the exact number of NOI members, but it is estimated to have been in the tens of thousands.|$|R
