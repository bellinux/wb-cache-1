40|$|Understanding the {{performance}} of banks is of the u tmost importance due to the impact the sector may have on economic growth and financial stability. Residential mortgage loans constitute {{a large proportion of}} the portfolio of many banks and are one of the key assets in the determination of performance. Using a dynamic panel model, we analyse the impact of res idential mortgage loans on bank profitability and risk, based on a sample of 555 banks in the European Union (EU - 15), over the period from 1995 to 2008. We find that banks with larger weight s in residential mortgage loans display lower credit risk in good market conditions. This result may explain why banks rush to lend on property during b ooms due to the positive effect it has on credit risk. The results also show that credit risk and profitability are lower during the upturn in the residential property cy cle. Furthermore, t he results reveal the existence of a non - linear relationship (U - shaped marginal effect), as a function of bank’s risk, between profitability and residential mortgage exposure. For those banks that have high er credit risk, a large exposur e to residential loans is associated with increased risk - <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability,</b> through a reduction in risk. For banks with a moderate to low credit risk, the impact of higher exposure are also positive on risk - <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability...</b>|$|E
40|$|A bank’s lending {{decision}} {{is affected by}} the amount of information it can access and by its capability to manage this information. The latter aspect implies that the bank has to decide whether borrowers should be managed in a local branch of the bank or in its headquarters. By looking at a sample of Finnish banks, the present research investigates a bank’s capability to extract profitability from both locally and centrally managed firms. We find that banks are able to properly discriminate bet ween firms: those which should be managed by loan managers with expert knowledge in the bank’s headquarters due to their complexity, and those firms which should be managed in the bank’s local branch because they are simpler and need standard products and services. As a result, banks are able to extract risk - <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> (RAP) from both centrally and locally managed customers. Our findings clearly support the argument that the decision to centralise or decentralise the lending decision process is not an either/or decision: banks should implement both approaches and apply according to the type of firm they serve...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate and compare the profitability of three different retail formats, with specific focus on the occupancy cost components. Size was identified as an important determinant of rent and this relationship is also investigated. Data from a large South African retailer, with stores in various formats was obtained. The profitability was calculated - using an <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> model - for three retail formats; large shopping centres, small shopping centres and stand-alone outlets. All data, including size details were obtained for a period of five years. The expectation of a negative relationship between store size and rent was rejected for individual stores as well as format groupings. The profitability analyses delivered mixed results between „rand value‟ and „percentage to sales‟ outcomes, but concluded that large shopping centres were the least profitable of the retail formats under review...|$|E
40|$|Motivation. Capital {{allocation}} {{can have}} substantial ramifications upon measuring risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> {{as well as}} setting risk loads for pricing. Current allocation methods that emphasize the tail allocate too much capital to extreme events; “capital consumption ” methods, which incorporate relative likelihood, tend to allocate insufficient capital to highly unlikely yet extremely severe losses. Method. In this paper I develop a new formulation {{of the meaning of}} holding capital equal to the Value at Risk. The new formulation views the total capital of the firm as the sum of many percentile layers of capital. Thus capital allocation varies continuously by layer and the capital allocated to any particular loss scenario is the sum of allocated capital across many percentile layers. Results. Capital allocation by percentile layer produces capital allocations that differ significantly from other common methods such as VaR, TVaR, and coTVaR. Conclusions. Capital allocation by percentile layer has important advantages over existing methods. It highlights a new formulation of Value at Risk and other capital standards, recognizes the capital usage of losses that do not extend into the tail, and captures the disproportionate capital usage of severe losses...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse success at the {{corporate}} level for 72 Australian mergers between publicly listed firms during the period 1999 - 2004, and to reassess evidence in earlier Australian studies that contrasts findings from other countries which report a decline in post-merger operating performance. Design/methodology/approach – A number of accounting operating performance measures for profitability, cash flow, efficiency, leverage and growth are used to proxy for the success of the merger, which is defined in terms of an improvement in each merged firm's industry-adjusted operating performance between the pre and post-merger period. Both non-parametric and parametric comparisons of these measures are presented. Findings – Some evidence that mergers improve the operating performance of the post-merger firm is found. Industry <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability,</b> cash flows, efficiency and leverage measures were higher in the post-merger period. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study are limited by the small sample size, the focus on listed firms, and the use of only operating financial measures of merger success. Future research could examine more mergers over a longer time period, use alternative methods of performance benchmarking, and use alternative measures of merger success, such as share price performance. Originality/value – Australian mergers led to improved corporate performance during the period 1999 - 2004. This result is consistent with findings in other countries but has not been found in prior Australian research. 13 page(s...|$|E

A propensity score matching (PSM) model was implemented to estimate the average effect of vertical coordination on a representative sample of Italian farms specialized in durum wheat production. To compare outcomes of treated and un-treated farms, we utilized some measures of farming activity, such as gross sales, gross margins, costs, yields, and an index of overall <b>profitability</b> <b>adjusted</b> by farm efficiency (Boone 2008).

40|$|The {{dependency}} {{structure of}} credit risk parameters {{is a key}} driver for capital consumption and receives regulatory and scientific attention. The impact of parameter imperfections {{on the quality of}} expected loss (EL) {{in the sense of a}} fair, unbiased estimate of risk expenses however is barely covered. So far there are no established backtesting procedures for EL, quantifying its impact with regards to pricing or risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> measures. In this paper, a practically oriented, top-down approach to assess the quality of EL by backtesting with a properly defined risk measure is introduced. In a first step, the concept of risk expenses (Cost of Risk) has to be extended beyond the classical provisioning view, towards a more adequate capital consumption approach (Impact of Risk, IoR). On this basis, the difference between parameter-based EL and actually reported Impact of Risk is decomposed into its key components. The proposed method will deepen the understanding of practical properties of EL, reconciles the EL with a clearly defined and observable risk measure and provides a link between upcoming IFRS 9 accounting standards for loan loss provisioning with IRBA regulatory capital requirements. The method is robust irrespective whether parameters are simple, expert based values or highly predictive and perfectly calibrated IRBA compliant methods, as long as parameters and default identification procedures are stable. Comment: 26 pages, new sections added to align with Basel 2 model validation concepts and to highlight possible application within IFRS 9 accounting standards.

The dialectical method of understanding the economic processes is the theoretical and methodological basis of the investigation. Such methods are used for achieving the purpose of the article: analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, abstract and logical method, comparison, modelling, methods of economic statistics, fuzzy sets. Results. On the basis of the present state of the methodology of the strategic financial analysis of company’s capital, it is theoretically grounded methodological approach to the capital structure optimization of the flour-and-cereals industry’s enterprises. As the result of the research, it is established that the level of equity profitability and effectiveness of company’s financial and economic activity are connected with the structure of funding sources. Therefore, to determine the target capital structure, it is proposed to take into account comprehensively such factors as the <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> of capital (assets) before interest and weighted average cost of capital. Since the company’s equity is characterized by a certain value, to determine the criterion of optimal capital structure, it is necessary to take into consideration the amount of expenses to maintain the existing funding structure. So, there is the necessity to use the modified model to assess the effect of financial leverage, considering the average cost of capital. The utilization of this criterion requires establishing additional limits of the optimal capital structure formation: restrictions on the functioning capital adequacy, on the level of financial stability, on the inalienability of differential of financial leverage, on the level of financial risk. The obtained results have the practical value because they contribute to systems integration of the strategic financial analysis of capital and the financial management requirements and create conditions for its implementation in practice of domestic enterprises. Value/originality. The suggested model of capital optimization can be used to determine its structure according to the necessity in loan capital and its limit value, which may involve the company at an acceptable level of financial risk...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{profitability}} of car manufacturers in relation to industry-wide profitability targets such as industry averages. Specifically {{we are interested in}} whether firms <b>adjust</b> their <b>profitability</b> in the direction of these targets, whether it is possible to detect any such change, and, if so, what the precise nature is of these changes. This paper introduces several novel methods to assess the trajectory of profitability over time. In doing so we make two contributions to the current body of knowledge regarding the dynamics of profitability. First, we develop a method to identify multiple profitability targets. We define these targets in addition to the commonly used industry average target. Second, we develop new methods to express movements in the profitability space from t to t + j, and define a notion of agreement between one movement and another. We use empirical data from the car industry to study the extent to which actual movements are in alignment with these targets. Here we calculate the three targets that we have previously identified, and contrast them with the actual profitability movements using our new agreement measure. We find that firms tend to move more towards to the new targets we have identified than to the common industry average. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

To explore and interpret the results the study has taken samples from five Islamic banks {{that have been in}} operation in Bangladesh on or before 2001 to till date. In order to construct the liquidity model it used four liquidity variables namely cash & due from banks to total assets (CDTA), cash & due from banks to total deposits (CDDEP), investment to total assets (INVSTA) and investment to total deposits (INVSDEP). According to <b>adjusted</b> R squares <b>profitability</b> variables return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and return on deposits (ROD) are respectively 17. 1 %, 4. 5 % and 24. 6 % dependent on independent variables. The statistical results suggest that CDTA is found insignificant with all profitability variables, whereas CDDEP is individually significant with all profitability variables except ROE. On the other hand INVSTA and INVSDEP are recognized significant with all three profitability variables. However, when ROE stands for an insignificant relationship with the overall liquidity model, ROA and ROD are identified significantly correlated with the similar model at 1 % significant level. Unsurprisingly the findings do strengthen the specification that the impact of liquidity reflects adequate imposition on profitability that the Islamic banks in Bangladesh must abide by...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates three {{comprehensive}} research {{issues in}} the context of five selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banking markets (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) during the period 1998 - 2010. This study is motivated by the extensive restructuring efforts {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) which has shaped the banking behaviour in ASEAN countries to enable them to sustain their financial systems’ stability. As a result of the crisis, banks adopted several strategies in response to various structural and policy changes and, therefore, there were vast effects on banks’ behaviour following the AFC and pre and post the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. The first empirical study of this thesis investigates the impact of market power on credit risk, revenue diversification and bank stability. The findings suggest that bank market power is positively associated with credit risk and revenue diversification. Nevertheless, these associations diminished during the GFC, implying that banks with greater market power were able to better manage their non-performing loans during the crisis period. Bank stability, however, is not associated with market power. Instead, it is found to be a negative function of state-ownership, asset composition and banking freedom. Overall, even though ASEAN banks with greater market power have higher credit risk, they are more diversified thus leaving their overall bank risk unaffected. The second empirical study examines the association between net interest margin, revenue diversification and risk-adjusted profitability. The findings suggest a two-way association between net interest margin and revenue diversification. The results denote a significant inverse relationship in the period 1998 - 2002, indicating subsidisation between interest and fee-generating business in the aftermath of the crisis. For the latter part of the sample (2003 - 2010), a positive association has been reported for net interest margin and revenue diversification implying that non-interest income does not necessarily increase with the detriment of the net interest margin. The findings reveal that diversification benefits exist for the same sub-sample period i. e. after the Basel II regulations came into force around 2003. The results also suggest that in the aftermath of both crises, risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>profitability</b> declined as banks had limited scope to diversify their sources of revenue. Overall, ASEAN banks have evolved over time, moving from the worsening risk-return trade-off to the beginnings of the benefits of diversification. The third empirical study investigates the influence of the cost of deposits, market power and the business cycle on the bank capital buffer determination. The findings imply that the capital buffer is positively associated with the cost of deposits, bank market power and the business cycle. The findings indicate that the higher the cost of deposits and the greater their market power, banks tend to hold a greater capital buffer. Furthermore, the capital buffer can vary pro-cyclically with the business cycle suggesting that banks can increase their capital buffers by expanding through various lending during economic upturns which will provide opportunities for banks to make use of this excess capital during recessions. Further, the findings suggest that the banking sector can contribute to the performance of the economy if they hold sufficient buffers and retain a healthy flow of credit when the economy is in crisis. This analysis provides some insight into ASEAN banks’ response to Basel III, which indicates that these banks will find it much harder to comply with the new regulations. This study contributes to the literature through providing evidence of the ASEAN banks’ diverse responses in the aftermath of the AFC and pre- and post-GFC with regard to the research issues. In addition, this thesis adds to the limited, but fast growing, literature on bank market power by using an improved version of the Lerner index in the form of a Funding adjusted Lerner index. Regarding the methodology, unlike other studies, this thesis extends the literature by addressing endogeneity by employing the GMM method for estimation. In addition, this thesis is includes a broader set of bank-specific, country-specific and industry-specific determinants together to address the research issues. Apart from the academic contributions, this thesis offers several implications for bankers, shareholders and regulators. The regional focus of the analysis provides useful insights for ASEAN banks for future policy formulation involving bank market power, credit risk, revenue diversification, bank stability, net interest margin, cost of deposits and the business cycle, given the restructured banking system in the region...|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} financial innovation {{that could be}} explained using evolutionary theory is modern risk management (Barlow, 1993). From World War II to the mid- 1960 s, risk management was mainly shaped by the practices and heuristics of business people, investors, and employees. Beginning in the late 1960 s, new risks emerged, and old ones were aggravated. Interest and exchange risks emerged after the termination of Bretton Woods. Other risks became more relevant such as energy prices, inflation, and rising funding costs. In response, the risk management function started to evolve and gain more relevance. In the late 1970 s, the US Bankers Trust developed the concept of {{risk-adjusted return on capital}} for the purpose of obtaining a measure of <b>profitability</b> <b>adjusted</b> for risk. At the same time, regulatory authorities began considering more standardized rules for risk management in banks (Field, 2003). For risk estimation, banks initially used repricing gap analysis, which estimated the effect of interest rates on interest income. Gap analysis evolved further to consider market values with the introduction of duration analysis. Duration {{is a measure of the}} sensitivity of a fixed income asset to interest rates. Another important evolutionary step was the introduction of value at risk measures by JP Morgan. Value at risk is a quantitative measure used to estimate the potential loss that a portfolio can have over a specific time frame. With the increasing use of derivatives and the need for a standard risk language, banks and regulators needed a measure for risk that was both easy to understand and allowed for comparison across banks. Therefore, a paradigm was established called modern risk management for which the value at risk measure was the main risk instrument. Risk management is still evolving and changing, particularly in response to the increasing number and complexity of risks faced by financial institutions.|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} network is a network {{consisting of a}} set of autonomous actors (e. g. enterprises, organizations and people) that collaborate to achieve common or compatible goals. In a {{collaborative network}} each enterprise contributes with its own specific products or services to satisfy the consumer need. Actual collaborative networks are often risky ventures because there is no central coordinator. A collaborative network that emerges gradually is not subject to the same risks as the participants engage in the network slowly. We develop techniques for designing IT-enabled collaborative networks and validating the risk that they entail. Some of the risks threatening a collaborative network designed in advance are: � the risk of non-executability (no feasible coordination) � the risk of fraud or in general untrustworthy partners � the risk of non-profitability � the risk of loss of business-confidential data In this work we address the first three types of risks. Designing collaborative networks calls for modeling the collaboration of enterprises from different perspectives, in particular the value and coordination perspectives, and for mutually aligning these perspectives. The need for these two perspectives stems from the importance of separating the how from the what concerns. The value perspective focuses on what is offered by whom to whom while the coordination perspective focuses on how these offerings are fulfilled operationally. Value modeling and coordination modeling have different goals and use different concepts. Nevertheless, the resulting models should be consistent with each other because they refer to the same system. The model that shows the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods or services of economic value in a collaborative network is called value model. The main goal of value modeling is to build a shared understanding of the business case and reach agreement amongst profit-and-loss responsible business actors regarding the question "Who is offering what of value to whom and expects what of value in return?" It also enables the actors to assess their potential profitability in the collaborative network to develop an insight into the economic viability and sustainability of the whole collaborative network. The study of the relation between value and coordination models is to address the executability of the collaborative network. The participating actors in a collaborative network are assumed to act trustfully in the collaboration and therefore trust is mostly left entirely outside the picture. However the assumption that business actors act trustfully is often not useful in practice (since there are malicious actors). Each partner agrees to act according to the value model, however during the business, actors need to be sure if their partners are acting according to the value model or not. Dropping the trust assumptions in business collaboration is to address the risk of untrustworthy partners. Finally, after taking the trust complications into account, we need to <b>adjust</b> the <b>profitability</b> and sustainability according to the new setting and hence address the risk of reduced profitability or even loss in the collaboration. The contributions of this thesis include: 1. Introducing a stepwise method to produce a consistent coordination model from a value model and vice versa in a multiperspective e-collaborative network design. 2. Analyzing collaborative networks from a trust perspective and introducing an approach to measure the trustworthiness of the actors participating in a collaborative network. 3. Assessing profitability and sustainability of some special collaboration settings using game theory concepts and techniques and refining the initial profitability analysis of the collaborative network by taking trust into account. We evaluate our findings using some real business collaboration cases...|$|R
