The second player is able to drop in or out of the game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> plays as Bunniguru. Bunniguru is faster than Scarygirl and has a different, martial arts inspired, set of moves in combat, but lacks Scarygirl's ability to grapple.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. At the start, {{players can}} select Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join in <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> control Tails separately. Sonic 3 adds {{the ability for}} Tails to fly {{for a short time}} by {{spinning}} his twin tails like a propeller; when he gets too tired, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.|$|E

The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the West Virginia Legislature, to convene the legislature <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and,</b> except when prosecution has been carried out by the House of Delegates, to grant pardons and reprieves.|$|E

5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E

5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, {{the presence of a}} hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|The Germans allowed Gens some {{privileges}} not {{accorded to}} other Vilnius Jews. He {{was not required}} to wear the yellow badge of the Star of David {{on the front and}} back of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave the ghetto <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> his daughter was not required to live in the ghetto, even though other half-Jews were confined within the ghetto. Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{main story}} {{revolves}} around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and {{takes place in the}} fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> run practice laps.|$|E
5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E
5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E

5|$|On February 18, WWE {{announced}} via {{its website}} that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match {{would take place}} at WrestleMania XXIV, a match where {{the objective is to}} retrieve a briefcase suspended in the air using a ladder. The match involved wrestlers from all three WWE brands. The winner would earn a contract to challenge for any of the three WWE World Championships (the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship of ECW) <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> any place over a one-year period. Qualifying matches occurred to determine the participants in the match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's Raw with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of SmackDown. During the next two weeks on Raw, Chris Jericho defeated Jeff Hardy, and Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify. At a non-televised SmackDown/ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble. On the March 11 episode of ECW, CM Punk became the seventh entrant when he defeated Big Daddy V. John Morrison was the final person to qualify when he beat The Miz on the March 14 episode of SmackDown. Jeff Hardy was later removed from the match after a legitimate suspension by WWE for a drug violation of the company's Wellness Policy. WWE decided not to add another superstar in his place, making that year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to have seven participants.|$|E
5|$|Talion is then {{sought out}} by the warrior Lithariel, the {{daughter}} of Queen Marwen (Claudia Black), who claims {{to be able to}} assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of Núrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses her powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics. Talion also gets help from a Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion the ways of the hunt to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron. Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The Tower mockingly taunts Talion that Celebrimbor chose him as a host and can free him <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> offers the elf a place at Sauron's side. Refusing the offer, the two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword. Afterwards, Celebrimbor confesses that the Tower told the truth and promises to let Talion join his family in death if he wishes, once the Black Hand is slain.|$|E
