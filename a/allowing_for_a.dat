As part of the works, tunnels connecting the East Coast Main Line to the Thameslink route were also built in readiness for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{ended their}} refusal of {{corporate}} sponsorship {{prior to the}} commencement of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year, €150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation was on the club's shirt for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013–14 season, the deal <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal. The deal with Qatar Airways was extended for one more year in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Collaborations was {{presented}} in an unusually lavish package, designed by Drew Lorimer and Olivia Harrison. Housed in a hinged box, the four discs sit on cardboard bases inside album covers measuring 8½ by 8½ inches, with the enlargement from CD and DVD dimensions <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> closer replication of the original LP jackets. A limited-edition release, each copy of the box set came with an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, a joint {{application}} {{submitted by}} the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) {{was approved by the}} Scottish Government <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trial reintroduction of the European beaver to the Knapdale Forest in Mid-Argyll. If the trial is successful then the European beaver will be the first mammal to be reintroduced to the United Kingdom. Beavers have been extinct in Scotland since the 16th century, when they were hunted for their pelt, meat and medicinal properties (use of castoreum).|$|E

5|$|Soyuz {{spacecraft}} provided manned {{access to}} and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> relatively quick return to Earth {{in the event of an}} emergency. Two models of Soyuz flew to Mir; Soyuz T-15 was the only Igla-equipped Soyuz-T to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped Soyuz-TM. A total of 31 (30 manned, 1 unmanned) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.|$|E

In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E

5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E

5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Mirror's Edge {{is set in}} a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, {{in which}} a network of 'runners', {{including}} the main character, Faith Connors, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-eight {{people were}} killed while on a relief mission to Leninakan when a Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 crashed on {{approach}} to the airport there. Nine crew and 69 military personnel were on board the plane that struck a helicopter in foggy conditions at the small airport that was overrun with rescue flights. In the days following the earthquake, the normally quiet airstrip was receiving up to 180 flights per day carrying food, medical supplies, and disaster management experts. Those who were killed on the plane were planning to join an estimated 20,000 soldiers and 85,000 civil defence workers in rescue efforts by searching for survivors, supplying food and water, and setting up sanitation facilities in the region. At the Yerevan airport, western pilots reported a breakdown in air traffic control communications, with flight controllers not delivering the necessary flight navigation instructions, <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> critical lack of separation as foreign planes {{made their way into}} the area.|$|E
