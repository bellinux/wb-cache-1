40|$|Users of {{a mobile}} phone are often {{required}} to adapt its <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> to context. While ringing tones may be obtrusive during meetings, a vibration alarm is barely noticeable on a bus. We propose setting the <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> automatically, based on context-information {{obtained from a}} variety of lowcost sensors. Our multi-sensor board captures audio, acceleration, compass readings, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and ambient light. Based on raw sensor data, we build five soft sensors representing context properties that are relevant for setting a suitable <b>alarm</b> <b>type.</b> In particular, we determine if the user keeps the phone close to the body, is involved in a conversation, is exposed to high background noise, is outdoors, or is physically active. Although a decision for the <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> can be made based on the context detected, users generally have different preferences as to what <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> to use in a given context. We therefore propose learning user preferences through reinforcement, by associating reactions like taking or hanging up an incoming call with rewards and punishments. Our experimenta...|$|E

However, determining the appropriate characteristics of decision support tools is difficult, especially when alarms can vary in the manner which diagnostic information is formulated and displayed and when event scenario types are complex and numerous. When first reviewed, the advantages or disadvantages of a particular alarm approach may not be apparent to the designer or analyst. The present research focuses on the review of two particular alarm strategies, binary <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> (BAT) and likelihood <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> (LAT), and reviews their influence upon accuracy, bias, and trust for tasks performed at a computer workstation capable of replicating a series of control-room-like alarms.

40|$|Success of semiconductor/LCD {{industry}} {{depends on}} its yield and quality of product. For the purpose, FDC (Fault Detection and Classification) system is used to diagnose fault state in main manufacturing processes by monitoring time series data collected by equipment sensors which represent various conditions of the equipment. The data set is segmented at the start and end of each product lot processing by a trigger event module. However, in practice, segmented sensor data usually have the features of data asynchronization such as different start points, end points, and data lengths. Due to the asynchronization problem, false <b>alarm</b> (<b>type</b> I error) and missed <b>alarm</b> (<b>type</b> II error) occur frequently. In this paper, we propose a robust process fault detection system by integrating a process event detection method and a similarity measuring method based on dynamic time warping algorithm.

A two-level, fractional factorial design of eight experimental configurations was developed around the five factors: fabric type, foam density, fire location, ventilation, and ignition scenario. A structure, designed to represent a single-story home or apartment, was constructed inside the Large Fire Laboratory at the National Institute for Standards and Technology for the experiments. The fire source was a chair mockup consisting of a seat and back cushion of a specific cover fabric and foam density, weighing between 5. 5 kg and 8. 3 kg. It rested on a metal frame and was subjected to a small propane gas flame, or an electric cartridge heater to initiate smoldering. Each experimental configuration was conducted three times.

It is generally thought that executive system is the main underlying cognitive factor of symptoms of OCD (Olley et al., 2007). Here we present two experiments aimed to investigate event based prospective memory (PM) functions in OCD. In the first experiment we adapted the experimental paradigm developed by Burgess et al. (2001), while in the second experiment we applied a modified dual-task paradigm, which required the altered execution and inhibition of responses to the same secondary task cues. According to our results the OCD group performed significantly slower on these tasks than the matched healthy control group. In the second experiment patients made significantly more false <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> errors {{and there was a}} significant positive correlation between the number of false alarms and the PM subscale scores of the Prospective Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ). These findings suggest that patients experience difficulties during event-based PM task and that these difficulties may originate from over-monitoring stimuli for possible PM cues and the disinhibition of activated out-of-date responses.

40|$|BACKGROUND—It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that endoscopy could be replaced with non-invasive assessment of helicobacter status in the initial work up of young dyspeptic patients without sinister symptoms.  AIMS—To determine the incidence of gastro-oesophageal malignancy in young dyspeptic patients.  METHODS—The Alberta Endoscopy Project captured clinical and demographic data on all endoscopies performed from April 1993  to February 1996  at four major adult hospitals in Alberta. The endoscopic and histological diagnosis in a subgroup of patients under 45  years of age without alarm symptoms that had undergone gastroscopy was reviewed. In addition, a random list of 200  patients was generated and their medical records reviewed in order to assess the proportion with symptoms suitable for a non-invasive management strategy.  RESULTS—Gastroscopy was performed in 7004  patients under 45  years. In 3634  patients (56 % female) <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> symptoms were absent; 78. 9 % of patients had symptoms amenable to a non-invasive initial approach, giving a corrected sample size of 2867  patients (correction factor 0. 789). Three gastric cancers, one case of moderate dysplasia, 10  biopsy proved cases of Barrett's oesophagus, and 19  oesophageal strictures/rings were detected within this sample. The corrected prevalence of gastric cancer in this select population was 1. 05  per thousand patients.  DISCUSSION—Endoscopy yielded three gastric cancers in this sample of under 45  year old dyspeptic patients without sinister symptoms. While initial non-invasive screening with one-week triple therapy for helicobacter positive individuals is unlikely to have a detrimental outcome the physician is advised to consider endoscopy in patients with persisting, recurrent, or sinister symptoms.    Keywords: Helicobacter pylori; dyspepsia; gastric cance...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{examination}} we {{have concluded}} {{that none of the}} alarms indicate the presence of a real threat. A brief history and results from our examination of the NYCT ASP occupancy data sets dated from 2007 - 05 - 14 19 : 11 : 07 to 2007 - 06 - 20 15 : 46 : 15 are presented in this letter report. When the ASP data collection campaign at NYCT was completed, rather than being shut down, the Canberra ASP annunciator box was unplugged leaving the data acquisition system running. By the time it was discovered that the ASP was still acquiring data about 15, 000 occupancies had been recorded. Among these were about 500 alarms (classified by the ASP analysis system as either Threat Alarms or Suspect Alarms). At your request, these alarms have been investigated. Our conclusion is that none of the alarm data sets indicate the presence of a real threat (within statistics). The data sets (ICD 1 and ICD 2 files with concurrent JPEG pictures) were delivered to LLNL on a removable hard drive labeled FOUO. The contents of the data disk amounted to 53. 39 GB of data requiring over two days for the standard LLNL virus checking software to scan before work could really get started. Our first step was to walk through the directory structure of the disk and create a database of occupancies. For each occupancy, the database was populated with the occupancy date and time, occupancy number, file path to the ICD 1 data and the alarm ('No Alarm', 'Suspect Alarm' or 'Threat Alarm') from the ICD 2 file along with some other incidental data. In an attempt to get a global understanding of what was going on, we investigated the occupancy information. The occupancy date/time and <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> were binned into one-hour counts.

User performance for all sound types improved over time, however even with experience a decrement in speed of response remained for the incongruent iconic sounds and in accuracy of performance for the abstract warning sounds when compared to the congruent auditory icons.

40|$|Functionally {{referential}} calls {{refer to}} specific stimuli {{in the external}} environment of the caller and cause receivers to show an adaptive response to them. Here I have addressed {{some of the questions}} about the underlying cognitive mechanisms of functionally referential alarm calls, using as examples meerkats and a few other species. Several social species have evolved alarm call systems with either predator-specific or non-specific alarm calls, or both. Because meerkats emit the same <b>alarm</b> call <b>types</b> in response to different predators, but independent of the location in relation to shelter or the behavior of the caller, these calls are denotative. Whether this is typical of referential calls in other species has still to be tested. In some species, the predator-specific calls appear to refer to a predator species or category, whereas in others they refer to the spatial area from which the predator is approaching or its behavior. The question arises as to whether the sam e cognitive mechanism underlies calls referring to the physical characteristics, the spatial position, or the behavior of the predator or whether different information processes distinguish these calls. When considering the different <b>alarm</b> call <b>types</b> with respect to the expression of the emotional state of the caller, the acoustic structure appears not to relate to the arousal of the caller in a simple linear way in all of the <b>alarm</b> call <b>types.</b> This suggests that the different referential and emotional components conveyed in the acoustic structure in the different species reflect more complicated mechanisms than a pure linear emotional system can explain...|$|R

Results: Database reports mentioned difficulties resolving log file data to the incident report and used log file data to confirm pro-gramming failures. Log file search revealed that, aside from <b>alarm</b> <b>types</b> and times, the devices were unable to adequately satisfy func-tional queries. Different simulated programming scenarios could not be easily differentiated by log file analysis.

40|$|Accurate glucose {{predictions}} {{can be used}} {{to provide}} early warnings of impending abnormal glycemia events. Before taking any action to correct the future violations, a measure of the reliability of the predictions is important and necessary to assess the uncertainty of the predicted values. To address this problem, data-driven empirical models are developed based on continuous glucose measurements for glucose prediction in this paper. An error bound in the form of prediction intervals is calculated to evaluate the prediction errors based on history predictions. Also, it is updated real time based on the most recent predictions. The hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are thus judged using the combination of predictions and the confidence limits. The above method is investigated by a combination of confidence limits and empirical models based on two groups of ambulatory subjects and two groups of in silico subjects using the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator for online short-term (0 - 60 min) glucose prediction. The different online <b>alarming</b> <b>types</b> of abnormal glycemia events are illustrated in Figure 1 where four classes of alarming degrees are defined.

Although multivariate statistical process control is receiving increased attention in the literature, little work has been done to deal with multi-attribute processes. In monitoring {{the quality of a}} product or process in multi-attribute environments in which the attributes are correlated, several issues arise. For example, a high number of false <b>alarms</b> (<b>type</b> I error) occur and the probability of not detecting defects (type II error) increases when the process is monitored by a set of independent uni-attribute control charts.
