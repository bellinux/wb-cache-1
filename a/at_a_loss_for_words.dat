Eminem said, [...] "I believe in... artistic expression." [...] Yankovic countered with, [...] "So you think, for example if somebody wanted to do, oh, I don't know, a parody of somebody else's video, {{they should be able}} to... artistically express themselves and just do it?" [...] Eminem was shown <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words.</b> Eminem later discussed the mock interview in the book The Way I Am, wherein he claimed to have taken the jab in good fun: ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010 Jordison {{was voted}} the best drummer of the {{previous}} 25 years by readers of Rhythm magazine, ahead of drummers such as Mike Portnoy, Neil Peart, Phil Collins, and Dave Grohl.

2500|$|The adult Snape, on {{the other}} hand, is portrayed as very self-assured and {{confident}} of his abilities, {{to a degree that}} Rickman described as [...] "full of himself." [...] Director David Yates said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power. Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words</b> or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused of cowardice. His otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.|$|E

2500|$|On Metacritic, Fantasy Ride {{received}} {{a score of}} 60 out of 100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". BBC Music states: [...] "When listing great pop stars of the 2000s, it's more than likely that Ciara will be unfairly forgotten. It's just as exciting to hear the slow jams as the club tracks, thanks to the detailed and often strange sounding backing tracks. She uses her silky vocals on softer tracks such as the Ne-Yo produced [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] or the delicate [...] "Never Ever" [...] to great effect. Only [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] with its somewhat bizarre sex/hospital metaphors may leave you <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words.</b> Overall it is a record that manages to make you dance as much as retreat to the bedroom, Fantasy Ride is an album which could take Ciara to the much deserved next level. Slant Magazine also gave the album a positive review ending the review by calling the album [...] "Ciara's smoothest ride ever".|$|E
2500|$|A cave then {{opens in}} front of the three, and Moses bids Aaron to enter. [...] Moses wishes now to for Aaron to remove the priestly vestments (as God had suggested), but again is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words.</b> [...] So, one more in an {{elliptical}} manner, Moses requests that Aaron leave the vestments with Eleazar outside the cave because they might otherwise become defiled in the cave (where there may be graves, Moses points out). [...] Aaron thinks it a wise idea, and leaves the vestments with Eleazar outside, but yet remains innocent {{of the nature of the}} circumstances. [...] Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. [...] Aaron now inquires what message Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. [...] Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. [...] Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. [...] However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself. [...] (Aaron is appeased by this argument, being evidently oblivious to the pathos therein.) ...|$|E
