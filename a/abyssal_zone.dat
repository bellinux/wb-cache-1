5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the <b>abyssal</b> <b>zone</b> include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E

25|$|Sea urchins have conquered most sea habitats, on an {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} depths. Some species, such as Cidaris abyssicola, can live down to several thousands of meters deep. Many genera are totally indentured to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>zone,</b> such as many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, or the strange genus Dermechinus. One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live only in the hadal zone and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E

500|$|Molluscs {{have more}} varied forms {{than any other}} animal phylum. They include snails, slugs and other gastropods; clams and other bivalves; squids and other cephalopods; and other lesser-known but {{similarly}} distinctive subgroups. The majority of species {{still live in the}} oceans, from the seashores to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>zone,</b> but some form {{a significant part of the}} freshwater fauna and the terrestrial ecosystems. Molluscs are extremely diverse in tropical and temperate regions, but can be found at all latitudes. About 80% of all known mollusc species are gastropods. Cephalopoda such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses are among the neurologically most advanced of all invertebrates. The giant squid, which until recently had not been observed alive in its adult form, is one of the largest invertebrates, but a recently caught specimen of the colossal squid, [...] long and weighing , may have overtaken it.|$|E

40|$|The {{autonomous}} {{underwater vehicle}} (AUV) capability has great important tasks for navigating into <b>abyssal</b> <b>zones</b> and dangerous underwater mission. Mostly AUV has {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOF) in motion and is classified in an underactuated system. The underactuated system is a system with fewer inputs than DOF. However, stabilizing an underactuated system is difficult tasks because of the nonlinear dynamic and model uncertainties. Thus, our aim is to obtain control algorithms using Integral Backstepping approach in order to stabilize the X 4 -AUV. The key idea of Integral Backstepping is to design a virtual controller by working together with the integration of tracking error.

40|$|Measuring and {{understanding}} patterns of ?-diversity remain major challenges in community ecology. Recently, ?-diversity {{has been shown}} to consist of 2 distinct components: (1) spatial turnover and (2) species loss leading to nestedness. Both components structure deep-sea macrofaunal assemblages but vary in importance among taxa and ocean basins and with energy availability. Here, we present the first evidence for turnover and nestedness along a bathymetric gradient in 2 major megafaunal taxa, holothurians and asteroids. Turnover is the dominant component of ?-diversity throughout bathyal and <b>abyssal</b> <b>zones</b> in both taxa, despite major differences in ?-diversity and trophic composition. High spatial turnover suggests a role for evolutionary adaptation to environmental circumstances within depth bands. This pattern differs fundamentally from those in some macrofaunal groups in low-energy environments where abyssal nestedness is high and diversity low, with diversity maintained partly by source-sink dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The deep-water fauna of the Mediterranean is {{characterized}} by an absence of distinctive characteristics and by a relative impoverishment. Both {{are a result of}} events after the Messinian salinity crisis (Late Miocene). The three main classes of phenomena involved in producing or recording these effects are analysed and discussed:- Historical: Sequential faunal changes during the Pliocene and thereafter in particular those during the Quaternary glaciations and still in progress. - Bathymetric: Changes in the vertical aspects of the Bathyal and <b>Abyssal</b> <b>zones</b> that took place under peculiar conditions, i. e. homothermy, a relative oligotrophy, the barrier of the Gibraltar sill, and water mass movement. The deeper the habitat of a species in the Mediterranean, the more extensive is its distribution elsewhere. - Geographical: There are strong affinities and relationships between Mediterranean and Atlantic faunas. Endemic species remain a biogeographical problem. Species always become smaller in size eastward where they occupy a progressively deeper habitat. Thus, the existing deep Mediterranean Sea appears to be younger than any other deep-sea constituent of the World Ocean...|$|R

The composition of Manganese-bearing minerals is dependent on how the nodules are formed; sedimentary nodules, which have a lower Mn2+ content than diagenetic, are dominated by Fe-vernadite, Mn-feroxyhyte, and asbolane-buserite while diagenetic nodules are dominated by buserite I, birnessite, todorokite, and asbolane-buserite.|$|R

40|$|Operationally {{oriented}} biostratigraphic and paleoecologic {{models are}} developed for Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene foraminifera of the Gulf Coast Basin. This paper is {{a companion to}} Breard et al. (1993), which describes models of significant paleoecologic and biostratigraphic foraminifera of the Miocene through Pleistocene of this region. Key benthic paleoenvironmental markers (Figs. 1 and 2) for particular depth zones of the Paleogene are graphically presented with updated biostratigraphic charts (Figs. 3 and 4). Estimates of environment ranges for optimal stratigraphic utility are listed for all marker species on the biostratigraphic charts. It {{is important to note}} that species depth ranges on the two biostratigraphic charts are for their zones of optimum stratigraphic utility. It is possible to find shallower species reworked or ranging into deeper-than-normal zones, where they have little or no correlative value. It is also possible to find deeper water species ranging into shallower zones. This is especially true in the lower bathyal to <b>abyssal</b> <b>zones</b> of the Eocene and Paleocene, where species considered characteristic of these zones range above those environments (van Morkhoven et al., 1986).

40|$|Benthic foraminiferal biofacies {{may vary}} {{independently}} of water depth and water mass; however, calibration of biofacies and stratigraphic ranges with independent paleodepth estimates allows reconstruction of age-depth patterns applicable throughout the deep Atlantic (Tjalsma and Lohmann, 1983). We {{have attempted to}} test these faunal calibrations in a continental margin setting, reconstructing Eocene benthic foraminiferal distributions along a dip section afforded by the New Jersey Transect (DSDP Sites 612, 108, 613). The following independent estimates of Eocene depths for the transect were obtained by "backtracking," "backstripping," and by assuming increasing depth downdip ("paleoslope") : Site 612, near the middle/lower bathyal boundary (about 1000 m); Site 108, in the middle bathyal zone (about 1600 m); and Site 613, near the lower bathyal/upper abyssal boundary (about 2000 m). Within uncertainties of backtracking (hundreds of meters), these estimates agree with estimates of paleodepth based on comparison of the New Jersey margin biofacies with other backtracked faunas. The stratigraphic ranges of many benthic taxa correspond to those found at other Atlantic DSDP sites. The major biofacies patterns show: (1) a depth dichotomy between an early to middle Eocene Nuttallides truempyidominated biofacies (greater than 2000 m) and a Lenticulina-Osangularia-Alabamina cf. dissonata biofacies (1000 - 2000 m); and (2) a difference between a middle and a late Eocene biofacies at Site 612. The faunal boundary at about 2000 m, between bathyal and <b>abyssal</b> <b>zones,</b> occurs {{not only on the}} margin, but also throughout the deep Atlantic. The faunal change between the middle and late Eocene at Site 612 was due to a decrease of Lenticulina spp., the local disappearance of N. truempyi, and establishment of a Bulimina alazanensis-Gyroidinoides spp. biofacies. Although this change could be attributed to local paleoceanographic or water-depth changes, we argue that it is the bathyal expression of a global deep-sea benthic foraminiferal change which occurred across the middle/late Eocene boundary...|$|R
