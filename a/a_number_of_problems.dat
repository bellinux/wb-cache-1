After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija).

Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability.

Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E
5|$|Iéna {{was laid}} down at Brest on 15 January 1898 after being {{authorized}} on 3 April 1897. She was launched on 1 September 1898, {{but did not}} enter service until 14 April 1902.

5|$|Montgomery's orders raised several issues, {{the first}} with the {{transport}} aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations. When they had arrived in North Africa, it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart, the 51st, with 82nd Airborne Division. A few weeks later this arrangement was switched, with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division; this seemed a logical decision, as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with. However, the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider-based one was problematic; the 51st had practically no glider experience, whilst the 52nd had much more but was already training for a parachute-based mission. To switch both was impractical and would have led to <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> which left 1st Airborne Division, and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade, with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing.|$|E
