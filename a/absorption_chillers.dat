40|$|The {{scheduling}} of both absorption {{cycle and}} vapour compression cycle chillers in trigeneration plants is investigated in this work. Many trigeneration plants use <b>absorption</b> cycle <b>chillers</b> only {{but there are}} potential performance advantages {{to be gained by}} using a combination of <b>absorption</b> and compression <b>chillers</b> especially in situations where the building electrical demand to be met by the combined heat and power (CHP) plant is variable. Simulation models of both types of chillers are developed together with a simple model of a variable-capacity CHP engine developed by curve-fitting to supplier’s data. The models are linked to form an optimisation problem in which the contribution of both chiller types is determined at a maximum value of operating cost (or carbon emission) saving. Results show that an optimum operating condition arises at moderately high air conditioning demands and moderately low power demand when the air conditioning demand is shared between both chillers, all recovered heat is utilised, and the contribution arising from the compression chiller results in an increase in CHP power generation and, hence, engine efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A {{microporous}} membrane is used {{in combination}} with rectangular microchannels in the absorber of an absorption chiller {{with the aim of}} reducing the size of this cooling technology. The simulation of the heat and mass transfer between the solution and the vapour phase in a H 2 O&-LiBr absorber using porous fibres is considered. Heat and mass transfer processes are modelled by means of selected correlations and data gathered from the open literature. This new model is applied for the simulation of the absorber under typical operating conditions of <b>absorption</b> cooling <b>chillers.</b> <b>Absorption</b> rate, heat and mass transfer coefficients, solution concentration, temperatures of the working fluids and pressure potential along the absorption channels are calculated. For the case considered in this study, the absorber channels are of 5 cm length, offering a maximum ratio between cooling capacity of the chiller and absorber volume of 1090 kW/m 3. This ratio is higher than twice the usual values found in falling film absorbers using conventional circular tubes. The mean absolute error between the model results and the experimental data gathered from the open literature is 8. 5 %, showing the capability of the model to predict the performance of membrane-based absorbers.

These compressors can account for a significant portion of a manufacturing facility?s electric consumption and any increase in efficiency can lead to economic benefits. Air compressors are sensitive to ambient conditions, as evidenced by the fact that compressing cooler and drier air decreases the amount of work required to compress the air. A thermodynamic model of an air compressor system was developed and several cases were run by using both vapor compression and <b>absorption</b> cycle <b>chillers</b> to cool and dehumidify the inlet air.

40|$|Optimal {{design of}} {{combined}} cooling, heating and power (CCHP) generation systems {{is presented in}} this paper. The goal {{of this study is}} comparison of a new operational strategy named variable electric cooling ratio (VER) with constant electric cooling ratio (CER) for different climates including hot, cold and moderate. In VER strategy, the share of <b>absorption</b> and electrical <b>chillers</b> supply load could vary during a year while in CER strategy it is constant. The gas engine is selected as prime mover and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to select the optimum CCHP equipments by maximizing the Relative Annual Benefit (RAB) as a new objective function. Optimization Results show that VER strategy, provides more benefit in comparison with CER strategy in all the studied climates. VER strategy shows 12. 71 %, 5. 84 % and 10. 92 % growth in optimum value of RAB in comparison with CER in the case of hot, cold and moderate climates, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum results demonstrate that a gas engine with higher nominal capacity is needed in VER compared with CER strategy. Results show that the VER strategy is a good alternative for following the cooling load in the CCHP operational strategy since it gives a good increment in RAB.

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{an important}} part in building services world-wide in both commercial and residential buildings. With the general attempt to reduce the usage of fossil fuels and increase the usage of green solutions, the market for solar air conditioning is growing rapidly. Solar air conditioning combines solar thermal absorbers to transfer solar radiation into heat with heat-driven cooling technologies. Common heat-driven cooling technologies are <b>absorption</b> and adsorption <b>chillers</b> using heat to produce cold by a thermodynamic cycle. However, solar thermal collectors are currently limited to roof applications, as their black surface with its tubing is not aesthetic. This limits the potential amount of possible heat gain, which could be used for solar air cooling or heating. By using the Klymaa ™ opaque coloured solar thermal collectors of SwissINSO, the solar coverage for air cooling and/or heating can be significantly increased, as they are aesthetically integrated into the façade. SwissINSO’s coloured collectors use a cover glass with a thin coating developed by the Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The coating is a multilayer system deposited by magnetron sputtering on solar float glass. The solar transmittance e of these coatings is high to assure a maximum efficiency of heat absorption by the black absorber behind the coloured cover glass. The absorber can be flat-plate or vacuum tubes, depending on the needs for the air conditioning, as the cover glass is opaque...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycles are {{energy systems}} mainly {{composed}} of a gasifier and a combined cycle power plant. Since the gasification process usually requires oxygen as an oxidant, an air separation unit {{is also part of}} the plant. Moreover, a producer gas cleaner unit is always present between the gasifier and the gas turbine. With respect to Natural Gas Combined Cycles, IGCCs are characterized by a consistent loss in the overall plant efficiency due to the conversion of the raw fuel in the gasifier and the electrical power parasitized for fuel production which considerably reduce the plant net electric power. Moreover, since these plants are based on gas-steam combined cycle power plants they suffer from a reduction in performance (a further net power decrease) when ambient temperature increases. Regarding this latter topic, different systems are currently used in gas turbine and combined cycle power plants in order to reduce gas turbine inlet air temperature, and, therefore, the impact of ambient conditions on performances. In this paper, a review of these systems is presented. Both systems based on water evaporative cooling and on refrigeration by means of <b>absorption</b> or mechanical/electrical <b>chillers</b> are described. Thermodynamic models of the systems are built within the framework of a commercial code for the simulation of energy conversion systems. A sensitivity analysis on the main parameters is presented.

40|$|Chillers are a {{significant}} component of large facility energy use. The focus {{of much of the}} development of chilled water systems {{in recent years has been}} on optimization of set point and staging controls, improvements in chiller design to increase efficiency and accommodate chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant replacements. Other improvements have been made by upgrading controls to the latest digital technologies, improving access and monitoring via communications and sophisticated liquid crystal displays (LCD), more robust fault diagnostics and operating and maintenance information logging. Advances have also been made in how chiller plant systems are designed and operated, and in the diversity of chiller products that are available to support innovative approaches. As in many industries, these improvements have been facilitated by advances in, and lower costs for, enabling technologies, such as refrigerants, compressor design, electronics for controls and variable frequency drives (VFD). Along with the improvements in electronics one would expect that advances have also been made in the functionality of unit controls included with chillers. Originally, the primary purpose of this project was to investigate the state of practice of chiller unit controllers in terms of their energy saving capabilities. However, early in the study it was discovered that advances in this area did not include incorporation of significantly different capabilities than had existed 10 - 15 years ago. Thus the scope has been modified to provide an overview of some of the basic controls-related energy saving strategies that are currently available along with guideline estimates of their potential and applicability. We have minimized consideration of strategies that could be primarily implemented via design practices such as chiller selection and plant design, and those that can only be implemented by a building management system (BMS). Also, since most of the floor space of federal buildings occurs in large buildings, we have focused on water-cooled screw and centrifugal chillers of 100 ton capacity and greater. However, the role of reciprocating and gas <b>chillers</b> (<b>absorption</b> and engine driven) is discussed briefly. Understanding the demographics of chiller deployment in the federal sector, state of practice of energy savings strategies and control features availability will help federal energy managers and program implementers to make informed decisions in support of energy saving performance contracting (ESPC) and other programs...|$|R
50|$|The {{thermodynamic}} cycle of an absorption chiller {{is driven by}} a heat source; this heat is usually delivered to the chiller via steam, hot water, or combustion. Compared to electrically powered chillers, an absorption chiller has very low electrical power requirements - very rarely above 15 kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump. However, its heat input requirements are large, and its COP is often 0.5 (single-effect) to 1.0 (double-effect). For the same tonnage capacity, an absorption chiller requires a much larger cooling tower than a vapor-compression chiller. However, <b>absorption</b> <b>chillers,</b> from an energy-efficiency point of view, excel where cheap, high-grade heat or waste heat is readily available.

40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{reduction}} of primary energy demand for heating and cooling the development of thermally driven <b>absorption</b> or adsorption <b>chillers</b> is pursued for several years. These machines use water as working fluid which evaporates {{in accordance with the}} operating conditions in a system pressure range between 7. 6 and 20. 7 mbar. As the development work show, the evaporator in ad-dition to the absorber or ad-sorber represents one of the key components for the cost-effective production, the reduction in the volume of construction and the optimization of the overall effi-ciency of these technologies. In this regard it is especially im-portant to improve the outer heat transfer between the evaporator wall and the working fluid due to the present low driving tempera-ture differences. Since evaporator concepts are as-pired that do not require a cir-culation pump for the working fluid, the present study focuses on possibilities to improve the heat transfer as they are present in pool boiling. The range of wall superheat that needs to be improved is given in accordance with the operating process of the machine up to a maximum of 7 K. Object of investigation is the efficient heat transfer by means of evaporation from metallic short fiber structures. High heat transfer rates are expected as these structures can utilize ca-pillary action in combination with micro-zone evaporation. Fur-thermore, the regime of nucleate boiling is expected to be reached at the given wall superheats due to their porous structure. The potential of these short fiber structures is analyzed using three different boiling cases. Firstly, the case of completely flooding of the fiber structure, secondly, the capillary-feeding and thirdly, the partial flooding of the fiber structure. A test rig was adapted to the present system pressures and a suitable boiling vessel concept has been developed. Water as working fluid is considered in a system pres-sure range between 9 and 15 mbar. Analyzing the influence of the various fiber structure parame-ters and the filling levels re-veals, that the range of nucleate boiling can be reached at the de-sired wall superheats with metal fiber structures. In doing so the initiation of nucleate boiling is significantly influenced both by the system pressure and the fill-ing level. In order to achieve maximum heat fluxes and the uti-lization of the optimal material it turns out that an evaporation process should be aimed for that exploits the capillary effect. The best results are achieved during the boiling case of capil-lary-feeding. Here, a considera-bly higher amount of heat is transferred in comparison to the complete flooding of the fiber structures especially at lower wall superheats. At the same time its potential is far from being exhausted. Comparing the measuring results with known correlations to pre-dict the initiation of nucleate boiling and for the range of nu-cleate boiling, they do not show any agreement for almost any of the considered boiling cases. For the boiling case of capillary-feeding a good agreement is achieved in some cases in the boiling regime without any bubble formation. However, substantial variations occur if the formation of micro-zone areas changes. In this case the achievable heat transfer rate is highly underes-timated and reveals the signifi-cant influence of the micro-zone evaporation to the overall heat transfer. The investigations further show that the appearance of nucleation hysteresis is not expected in the case of their potential use. Moreover, the results show only a slight change of the measurement result considering different de-grees of oxidation of the applied fiber structure material. Accord-ingly, for their potential use in the evaporator no change in heat transfer is expected even over a longer operation period...|$|R
