For the different simulated ozone column thicknesses, biologically effective irradiances were experimentally determined from the biofilm data and compared with calculated data using a radiative transfer model and the known biofilm action spectrum. The data show a strong increase in biologically effective solar UV irradiance with decreasing (simulated) ozone concentrations.

Using solar 10 - 7 -cm flux data and 30 -mbar Singapore wind data (QBO), a time series has been constructed that reproduces the long-term behavior of the globally averaged ozone. Removal of the apparent solar cycle effect from the global average reduces the net ozone loss to 2. 66 + or - 1. 4 percent per decade.

40|$|We {{have adopted}} the {{transport}} scenarios used in Part 1 to examine the sensitivity of stratospheric aircraft perturbations to transport changes in our 2 -D model. Changes {{to the strength of}} the residual circulation in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and changes to the lower stratospheric K(sub zz) had similar effects in that increasing the transport rates decreased the overall stratospheric residence time and reduced the magnitude of the negative perturbation response in <b>total</b> <b>ozone.</b> Increasing the stratospheric K(sub yy) increased the residence time and enhanced the global scale negative <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> response. However, increasing K(sub yy) along with self-consistent increases in the corresponding planetary wave drive, which leads to a stronger residual circulation, more than compensates for the K(sub yy) -effect, and results in a significantly weaker perturbation response, relative to the base case, throughout the stratosphere. We found a relatively minor model perturbation response sensitivity to the magnitude of K(sub yy) in the tropical stratosphere, and only a very small sensitivity to the magnitude of the horizontal mixing across the tropopause and to the strength of the mesospheric gravity wave drag and diffusion. These transport simulations also revealed a generally strong correlation between passive NO(sub y) accumulation and age of air throughout the stratosphere, such that faster transport rates resulted in a younger mean age and a smaller NO(y) mass accumulation. However, specific variations in K(sub yy) and mesospheric gravity wave strength exhibited very little NO(sub y) -age correlation in the lower stratosphere, similar to 3 -D model simulations performed in the recent NASA "Models and Measurements" II analysis. The base model transport, which gives the most favorable overall comparison with inert tracer observations, simulated a global/annual mean <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> response of - 0. 59 %, with only a slightly larger response in the northern compared to the southern hemisphere.

Here we present the technical specifications {{and the performance of}} a spectroradiometer for the highly accurate determination of actual UV levels. The sensitivity, the spectral resolution and the wavelength accuracy of the instrument, as well as results from a series of intercomparisons, justify use of the term "highaccuracy". Spectroradiometric measurements made with our instrument in Germany and New Zealand show that the decreasing stratospheric ozone levels in both hemispheres, and the increasing tropospheric ozone levels in Germany, have led to significant differences in UV-B radiation between Germany and New Zealand. The ratios of the weighted irradiances range from 1, 5 to 2, depending on the biological weighting function, in clear-sky summer conditions. A comparison of spectral UV measurements in Germany between 1992 and 1993 showed enhanced levels of UV-B radiation in the late spring and early summer of 1993 caused by reduced <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> columns. The monthly <b>averaged</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> columns in 1993 were the lowest since ozone levels were systematically recorded in Germany.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the total ozone distribution in our two-dimensional photochemical model to dynamical inputs has been explored. The residual circulation has been computed from three sets of heating rates but using the same temperature distributions. These heating rates result in advection fields that are appropriately linked with the magnitude of their vertical winds in the lower stratosphere and are called: (1) the strong circulation, (2) the weak circulation, and (3) the combined circulation. Three different formulations of horizontal eddy diffusion have also been investigated, including (1) a small constant diffusion, (2) a computed diffusion from potential vorticity using measured tempera-tures, and (3) a self-consistent diffusion determined from the meridional velocity. Finally, we studied two different formulations of vertical eddy diffusion: (1) a small constant diffusion and (2) an altitude-dependent larger diffusion. Our modeled global <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> varies by up to 10 %. depending on the various dynamical inputs, and the seasonal and latitudinal variabilities are even more substantial. The calculations indicate that total ozone in the middle to high latitudes is very sensitive to the advection field below 100 mbar, the region where the heating rates (which are used in computing the advection field) are most uncertain.

40|$|The {{currently}} archived (1989) {{total ozone}} mapping spectrometer (TOMS) and {{solar backscattered ultraviolet}} (SBUV) total ozone data (version 5) show a global average decrease of about 9. 0 percent from November 1978 to November 1988. This large decrease disagrees with an approximate 3. 5 -percent decrease estimated from the ground-based Dobson network. The primary source of disagreement was found to arise from an overestimate of reflectivity change and its incorrect wavelengths dependence for the diffuse plate used when measuring solar irradiance. Both of these factors have led to an overestimate of the rate of atmospheric ozone depletion by SBUV and TOMS. For total ozone measured by TOMS, a means has been found to use the measured radiance-irradiance ratio from several wavelengths pairs to construct an internally self-consistent calibration. The method uses the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity to calibration errors and the requirement that albedo ratios for each wavelength pair yield the same total ozone amounts. Smaller errors in determining spacecraft attitude, synchronization problems with the photon counting electronics, and sea-glint contamination of boundary reflectivity data have been corrected or minimized. New climatological low-ozone profiles have been incorporated into the TOMS algorithm that are appropriate for Antarctic ozone hole conditions and other low ozone cases. The combined corrections have led to a new determination of the global <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> trend (version 6) as a 2. 9 + or - 1. 3 percent decrease over 11 years (October 1978 to November 1989) ...|$|E

The situation is discussed in relation to the relative location of Eureka with respect to the polar vortex boundary and the chemical ozone loss inside the polar vortex. In 1997 / 98,Eureka was inside the polar vortex in the lower stratosphere (475 K potential temperature level) only in the middle of December, early to mid-February and early to mid-March. The period was shorter than in the former 3 years. Moreover, daily T_ values when the lower stratosphere over Eureka was inside the polar vortex were not so low compared with those in the former 3 years, and PSCs were not observed over Eureka. The year to year variation of the temperatures in the lower stratosphere (T_) over Eureka inside the polar vortex was generally consistent with the variation of the one within the entire polar vortex. A positive correlation between intravortex potential vorticity (PV) and ozone mixing ratio is expected in the lower stratosphere in the absence of strong chemical ozone loss. In 1997 / 98,this relation seems to have held during the winter to early spring over Eureka. Also, the total ozone in 1997 / 98 over Eureka when Eureka was inside the polar vortex in the lower stratosphere was higher than in the former 3 years. These suggest that the chemical ozone loss in 1997 / 98 inside the polar vortex was small in contrast to the former 3 years...|$|E
40|$|Indicators {{evaluated}} {{from the}} long-term hourly averages of ozone volume fractions at air monitoring sites are proposed as {{measures of the}} photochemical pollution exposure at those sites. These indicators {{are based on the}} average of the daily maximum-to-minimum ratio during the period of maximum ozone production and are corrected a), for the average maximum to <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> ratio (indicator P 1) and b), for the number of hours the limit ozone volume ratio limit of 80 ppb was exceeded (indicator P 2). These indicators are then combined into P 3 as their geometrical mean. The rationale for the introduction of a new set of indicators is based on the suspicion that ozone volume fractions do not provide information either on the total daily ozone that is produced or on the fraction of it that has produced other photochemical pollution components despite that ozone correlates quite well with some of them. Unlike the European stations, where every case in excess of the 80 ppb limit occurs within the April to September "growth period", stations in the subtropics have longer periods (e. g. at Greater Baton Rouge (GBR), USA, for 2001 to 2008) are shifted towards later months June to November (e. g. the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China for 2006). While GBR and the rural PRD stations exhibit indicators close to those of polluted stations in northern Italy (Po Valley), the (sub) urban PRD stations have high photochemical pollution indicators. However, a surprisingly low indicator level occurs for the coastal Hong Kong stations for reasons possibly attributable to the prevailing easterly winds which bring fresh air and airborne sea-salt particulates.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which quantities that are based on total column ozone are applicable as measures of ozone loss in the polar vortices. Such quantities have been used frequently in ozone assessments by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and also to assess the performance of chemistry-climate models. The most commonly considered quantities are March and October mean column ozone poleward of geometric latitude 63 &deg; and the spring minimum of daily total ozone minima poleward of a given latitude. Particularly in the Arctic, the former measure is affected by vortex variability and vortex break-up in spring. The minimum of daily total ozone minima poleward of a particular latitude is debatable, insofar as it relies on one single measurement or model grid point. We find that, for Arctic conditions, this minimum value often occurs in air outside the polar vortex, both in the observations and in a chemistry-climate model. Neither of the two measures shows a good correlation with chemical ozone loss in the vortex deduced from observations. We recommend that the minimum of daily minima should no longer be used when comparing polar ozone loss in observations and models. As an alternative to the March and October mean column polar ozone we suggest considering the minimum of daily <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> poleward of 63 &deg; equivalent latitude in spring (except for winters with an early vortex break-up). Such a definition both obviates relying on one single data point and reduces the impact of year-to-year variability in the Arctic vortex break-up on ozone loss measures. Further, this measure shows a reasonable correlation (r=&ndash; 0. 75) with observed chemical ozone loss. Nonetheless, simple measures of polar ozone loss must be used with caution; if possible, it is preferable to use more sophisticated measures that include additional information to disentangle the impact of transport and chemistry on ozone...|$|E

40|$|The <b>total</b> {{amount of}} <b>ozone</b> in a {{vertical}} column has been measured spectroscopically at near ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, using ground- and satellite-based instruments. The vertical distribution of ozone {{from the surface}} up to approximately 100 km has been measured {{by a variety of}} techniques - chemical and optical - and from a number of observing platforms, including balloon, rocket, and satellite platforms. The various methods presently used for determining the atmospheric ozone distribution are reviewed, along with a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. The observed <b>average</b> distribution of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> for the period 1958 - 1975 shows the expected geographic and seasonal variations. The variations of <b>total</b> <b>ozone,</b> including hemispheric differences, are clearly associated with large-scale circulation processes in the lower stratosphere. Approximately ten years of observations of the vertical ozone distribution, up through the ozone maximum, also show geographic and seasonal variations strongly related to the lower stratosphere circulation. The distribution above the maximum, however, results from the interaction of photochemistry and stratospheric motions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which commonly considered quantities, based on total column ozone observations and simulations, are applicable as measures of ozone loss in the polar vortices. Such quantities have been used frequently in ozone assessments by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and to assess the performance of chemistry-climate models. The most commonly considered quantity is monthly mean column ozone poleward of a latitude of 63 &deg; in spring. For the Arctic, these monthly means were found to be insensitive to the exact choice of the latitude threshold, unlike the Antarctic where greater sensitivity was found. Choosing a threshold based on the location of the transport barrier at the vortex boundary instead of geometric latitude led to a roughly similar year-to-year variability of the monthly means, but in particular years deviations of several tens of Dobson units occurred. Moreover, the minimum of daily total ozone minima poleward of a particular latitude, another popular measure, is debatable, insofar as it relies on one single measurement or model grid point. For Arctic conditions, this minimum value occurred often in air outside polar vortex, both in the observations and in a chemistry-climate model. As a result, we recommend that the minimum of daily minima no longer be used when comparing polar ozone loss in observations and models. As a possible alternative, we suggest considering the minimum of daily <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> poleward of a particular equivalent latitude (or in the vortex) in spring. This definition both obviates relying on one single data point and reduces the impact of year-to-year variability in the Arctic vortex breakup on ozone loss measures. However, compact relations of such simple measures with meteorological quantities that describe the potential for polar heterogeneous chlorine activation and thus ozone loss were not found. Therefore, we argue that where possible, more sophisticated measures of chemical polar ozone loss that include additional information to disentangle the impact of transport and chemistry on ozone, should be employed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Maps of {{the solar}} {{erythemal}} ultraviolet (UV) radiation daily doses were created for every month with horizontal resolution of 500 m at geographical domain 47. 15 N – 49. 86 N x 16. 94 E – 22. 81 E covering the territory of Slovakia. Cloud modification factor (cmf) for the UV radiation was modeled utilizing relation between the cmf of total and UV radiation for 6 solar zenith angle (SZA) categories. Clear-sky UV and total radiation daily doses were calculated using radiative-transfer models. Measurements of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> performed by Brewer spectrophotometer at Poprad-Ganovce (inside the investigated domain) were considered representative for selected geographical area. Information on snow cover presence was the only meteorological parameter used in the model. Verification of the model was performed at 5 observatories equipped with broadband solar UV radiometers. The maps of the cmf factor for the UV radiation were created utilizing measurements of total solar radiation performed at 7 observatories and the model of monthly cmf dependence on altitude. Maps of clear-sky UV radiation daily dose and UV radiation daily dose affected by average cloudiness were created for <b>average</b> monthly <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> value, its upper and lower monthly limits and for 1 day representing typical values of every month...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Submitted study {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of enhanced daily values of UV-B radiation (280 - 320 nm) in July 2005 in the Czech Republic {{as a consequence}} of low amount of stratospheric ozone in this period. The 30 th July of 2005 was chosen as a representative day for case study, because the amount of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> dropped 12. 5 % below the long-term mean at Hradec Králové observatory. The statistical model for estimating daily values of UV-B radiation (developed at Institute of Agrosystems and Bioclimatology at Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno) was used for 88 stations from the Czech Republic. This model requires (as an input data) values of daily sum of Global radiation (RG), daily sum of extraterrestrial radiation (RA), amount of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and altitude. Firstly, daily sums of UV-B for each station based on measured <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> content were derived. Subsequently these values were compared with results of model which corresponds to <b>average</b> amount of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> content. The UV-B increment during 30 th July 2005 (as effect of stratospheric ozone decrease) reached 323. 6 J·m- 2 ·day- 1 at the average in the Czech Republic. For detailed assessing of UV-B increase the spatial analysis with using of Geographical Information System (ArcInfo GIS software) was conducted...|$|R

40|$|As {{the most}} {{prominent}} feature of the polar stratosphere, polar vortex results in widespread changes in the climate system, especially in the ozone variation. In this study, the linkage between polar vortex and ozone depletion in Antarctic stratosphere during the period 1979 – 2016 is investigated; we calculated the <b>averaged</b> <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> within the polar vortex based on the vortex edge (− 28. 8 [*]PVU PV contour) instead of the geographical region defined by latitude and longitude. Results from the spatial patterns of ozone and polar vortex suggest that the morphological changes of polar vortex can impact the {{horizontal distribution of ozone}} and the ozone within the polar vortex experiences a severe depletion in spring. The negative relationship between ozone and polar vortex in terms of vortex area, strength, and breakup time is significant with the correlation coefficients of − 0. 57, − 0. 68, and − 0. 76, respectively. The breakup time of polar vortex {{plays an important role in}} the relation between polar vortex and ozone depletion with the highest-value correlation coefficient among three polar vortex parameters. Furthermore, the possible mechanism for this relationship is also discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For the 27 -year period 1933 - 1959 inclusive, highly {{significant}} negative correlation is {{found between the}} relative sunspot number and the worldwide <b>average</b> of <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>ozone.</b> Peak correlation {{with respect to the}} present-day 10 -year sunspot cycle is found at a lag of 1 •/ • to 2 years of the sunspots relative to ozone. The peak correlation of <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> with the mean latitudinal distance from the solar equator of the total area of sunspots is almost identical in magnitude to that with sunspot number. Itowever, the peak correlation with sunspot latitude is found at a lag of less than 6 months of the ozone relative to sunspot latitude, in the opposite direction to that with sunspot number. This phase difference of the negative correlation suggests that atmospheric ozone is much more sensitive to sunspot latitude than to sunspot number. INTRODUCTORY P•EMARKS The author's longtime interest in atmospheric ozone as a possible link between solar activity and climate was increased by the implications of a recent paper by Kraus [1961].
