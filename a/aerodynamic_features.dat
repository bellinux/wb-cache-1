5|$|While demonstrating {{excellent}} results, {{this campaign}} showed {{the need to}} change some of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> of the weapon. To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered dual-mode (laser- and GPS/INS-guided) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and Rafale fighter-bombers. The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9, 2008 after three firings at the DGA's missile test range in Biscarosse. This 250kg IR version performed a night launch from a Rafale fighter-bomber at DGA's Biscarosse test range in December 2010.|$|E
25|$|Using certain {{aesthetic}} and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> of the 250 GT and 250 GTO, Pininfarina led {{the design of}} the 250 GT Lusso, regarded by many {{as one of the most}} beautiful Ferraris ever made; it attracted notable personalities of that time, such as Steve McQueen and Eric Clapton.|$|E
25|$|The first {{operational}} {{version of}} the Meteor, designated as the Meteor F.1, apart from the minor airframe refinements, was a straightforward 'militarisation' of the earlier F9/40 prototypes. The dimensions of the standard Meteor F.1 were 41ft 3 in (12.58m) long with a span of 43ft 0 in (13.11m), with an empty weight of 8,140lb (3,823kg) and a maximum takeoff weight of 13,795lb (6,270kg). Despite the revolutionary turbojet propulsion used, {{the design of the}} Meteor was relatively orthodox and did not take advantage of many <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> utilised on other jet fighters, such as swept wings; the Meteor shared a broadly similar basic configuration to its German equivalent, the Messerschmitt Me 262.|$|E
50|$|Wing twist is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature</b> {{added to}} {{aircraft}} wings to adjust lift distribution along the wing.|$|R
50|$|According to AIO (Aerospace Industries Organisation), the {{aircraft}} {{that will be}} flight tested during 2017 and will have twin, outwardly canted vertical fins. This type of a tail design has become a favoured <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature</b> of Iranian designers {{that dates back to}} the development of the reverse-engineered Iranian version of the Northrop F-5, the HESA Saeqeh.|$|R
50|$|A {{leading edge}} slot is a fixed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature</b> {{of the wing}} of some {{aircraft}} to reduce the stall speed and promote good low-speed handling qualities. A leading edge slot is a spanwise gap in each wing, allowing air to flow from below the wing to its upper surface. In this manner they allow flight at higher angles of attack and thus reduce the stall speed.|$|R
25|$|The Javelin was the RAF's first {{purpose-built}} all-weather interceptor aircraft. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> of {{the type}} included its adoption of the new delta wing and a large tailplane. Fuel and armaments were housed in the delta wing, while the engines and crew were contained within the fuselage. The delta wing and tailplane combination had been deemed necessary by Gloster for effective manoeuvrability at high speed and for the aircraft to be controllable at low landing speeds. In one instance during testing, when both elevators had been torn off by elevator flutter, the Javelin remained controllable {{in part due to}} the aerodynamic qualities of the large tailplane. Changes from the prototypes included alterations to the rear fuselage and lengthened engine jet exhausts, to eliminate buffeting of the rudder by the jet exhaust and increased sweepback of the wing's leading edge to improve high-speed handling.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the aircraft's unorthodox <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features,</b> the Javelin had a fairly {{conventional}} structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the nose (containing the radar radome), the front fuselage, centre fuselage and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were {{on either side of}} the centre fuselage section, the internal space in the centre containing the service bay that housed much of the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} lap of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, leader Carl Edwards swerved {{into the path}} of Brad Keselowski in order to prevent Keselowski from passing; Keselowski turned Edwards into the air and Edwards's car bounced off of the hood of Ryan Newman's car and flipped into the catch fence, then came to a rest {{in the middle of the}} track further down. Edwards was uninjured, but the crash was {{compared}} to an accident at Talladega in 1987 where Bobby Allison went airborne and hit the catch fence in a similar location. Allison's crash (coming at speeds 20 MPH faster than Edwards' crash) ripped out a 100-foot section of the catch fence, while Edwards' crash only bent the support poles. Seven spectators were injured in Edwards' accident from debris. The aftermath of the accident spawned questions about the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> of the CoT, the nature of pack racing with restrictor plates, and the safety features of Talladega Superspeedway. Video replay showed that despite deploying, the car's roof flaps did nothing to stop the car from flipping– a common failing of the devices dating to their very first month in use– and the second hit from Newman flipped the car higher.|$|E
5000|$|A {{roof flap}} is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature</b> on race cars, mainly stock cars, which {{functions}} {{as an emergency}} spoiler to prevent the vehicle from lifting off the ground. The flaps are stowed during normal vehicle operation; however, in certain situations, e.g., if the vehicle goes into a spin, particularly if it is facing backwards, the flaps deploy to disrupt the air flow over the roof and reduce the lift force on the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The {{deflectable}} nose missile has {{a longer}} range by deflecting its nose {{to improve its}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature.</b> Based on detached eddy simulation (DES), the supersonic flow fields of a missile with deflectable nose are simulated numerically and its aerodynamic force coefficients are calculated under {{the condition of the}} deflection angles vary from 0 ° to 8 °, angles of attack, 0 °– 8 °, and mach numbers, 2 to 5. Coupling these aerodynamic coefficients with the plumb plane ballistic equations, the extended flight range has been calculated. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for the solution of maximum range of the deflected missile...|$|R
5000|$|The Draken was {{developed}} during the 1940s and 1950s to replace Sweden's first generation of jet-powered fighter aircraft, the Saab J 29 Tunnan and, later, the fighter variant (J 32B) of the Saab 32 Lansen. It featured an innovative [...] "double-delta" [...] wing; {{in order to test}} this previously-unexplored <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>feature,</b> a sub-scale test aircraft, the Saab 210, was produced and flown. Indigenously developed in Sweden, the Draken was introduced into service with the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF) on 8 March 1960. Early models were intended purely to perform air defense missions, the type being considered to be a capable dog fighter for the era.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the supply}} of spare parts had been assured by mid-season, the B186s were {{modified}} to incorporate a whole array of new <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> (including front and rear wings and a revised underbody), new suspension packages and revised setup concepts. The chassis was also strengthened further {{to cope with the}} stress caused by the power of the BMW engine. The development package was completed by the arrival of a new rear wing design for the Austrian Grand Prix, where the improved performance of the B186 and the high-speed Österreichring circuit made it the fastest car in the field with Fabi (pole) and Berger occupying the front row of the grid. The car's competitiveness improved throughout the season, particularly during the second half, {{as a result of this}} development. In addition, it also became more reliable, although this aspect remained suspect throughout the year with a total of nineteen retirements from 32 starts. The competitiveness of the Pirelli tyres also improved, and their relative durability compared to the Goodyears often played to the B186's advantage, exemplified by the fact that Berger won the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix due to not having to make a pit stop for a fresh set of tyres while most of the main contenders (with the exception of Prost's McLaren which finished 2nd) made at least two stops for tyres due to the abrasive surface of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.|$|E
500|$|The shared wing {{design with}} the A340 allowed the A330 to {{incorporate}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> {{developed for the}} former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines' radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 [...] "SuperFan", which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a [...] span, the wing was later extended to [...] and finally to [...] At , the wingspan {{is similar to that}} of the larger Boeing 747–200, but with 35 percent less wing area.|$|E
2500|$|Several major {{elements}} of the EC155, such its rotor system (albeit modified to operate at slower rotational speeds), {{were used in the}} Eurocopter X3, an experimental high-speed compound helicopter which set an unofficial speed record of [...] in 2013. In 2015, a EC155 was also used by Airbus Helicopters as a flying testbed for new <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features,</b> such as the rotor blades, biplane stabilizer and canted fenestron, for the developing Airbus Helicopters H160 helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The Cordoba's sales {{decline in}} 1978 and 1979 {{could also be}} {{attributed}} to the introduction of the smaller Chrysler LeBaron in mid-1977 that was available in both sedan and coupe models, and offered similar personal-luxury styling and options. Facelifted from the abandoned line was the redesigned Ulu trim, whose <b>aerodynamic</b> exterior <b>featured</b> chrome bumpers, black accenting on the trunk and unique headlights.|$|R

2500|$|The 997 GT3 model also {{debuted in}} Geneva in 2006. [...] Like {{previous}} GT3 models, it {{is a way}} for Porsche to homologate <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> for racing, as well as a starting model for customer racing. The 997 GT3 was priced at US$106,000. The engine has the same displacement as the Turbo, but without turbocharger and uses a new variable intake system. The engine is rated at [...] and [...] It has an 8400 rpm redline which {{is the same as the}} [...] Carrera GTs. The 3.6L dry-sump engine does not suffer from the rear main seal problems of the earlier 3.6L/3.8L integrated dry-sump engines.|$|E
2500|$|Dassault's {{resulting}} prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, {{looked a}} lot like the Mirage IIIA, even though it had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the unladen weight. The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft's <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> were very similar to the III's but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was [...] long, had a [...] wingspan, [...] of wing area, and weighed approximately [...] It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.|$|E
2500|$|During {{exhalation}} the intrapulmonary bronchi {{were believed}} to be tightly constricted between the region where the ventrobronchi branch off and the region where the dorsobronchi branch off. But it is now believed that more intricate <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>features</b> have the same effect. [...] The contracting posterior air sacs can therefore only empty into the dorsobronchi. From there the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi open up during exhalation, thus allowing oxygen-poor air from these two organs to escape via the trachea to the exterior. Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.|$|E
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{for controlling}} {{the quality of}} multiply-refined tetrahedral meshes is presented in this paper. The basic dynamic mesh adaption procedure allows localized grid refinement and coarsening to efficiently capture <b>aerodynamic</b> flow <b>features</b> in computational fluid dynamics problems; however, repeated application of the procedure may significantly deteriorate {{the quality of the}} mesh. Results presented show the effectiveness of this mesh quality algorithm and its potential in the area of helicopter aerodynamics and acoustics...|$|R
