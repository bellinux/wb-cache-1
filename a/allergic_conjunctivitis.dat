40|$|Type I allergy {{represents}} a hypersensitivity occurring in almost 20 % {{of the population}} that is based on the recognition of innocuous airborn antigens (pollen, mite, mould and pet allergens) by specific immunoglobulin E. Allergic symptoms (e. g. <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> asthma) are caused by the release of biological mediators from effector-cells after allergen-induced crosslink of receptor-bound IgE. Here we discuss strategies to obtain recombinant allergen-specific antibody fragments (Fabs) from mouse and human cell lines as well as directly from allergic patients lymphocytes via the combinatorial library technology. It is suggested to use recombinant allergen-specific Fabs for the standardization of allergen extracts currently used for diagnosis and treatment, to determine allergen contents in allergen sources and the environment to allow preventive measures and to use allergen-specific Fabs as therapeutic tools to interfere with the allergen-IgE interaction. The latter appears possible because IgE represents the least abundant class of immunoglobulins and there is increasing evidence for a limited diversity among allergens and their B-cell epitopes. Moreover, allergic effector reactions are mostly confined to accessible target organs so that a local application of competing Fabs prior to allergen exposure might represent a feasible therapeutic approach...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic fungal spores are {{important}} aeroallergens {{associated with the}} development of allergic diseases. They are the third most common allergen after house dust mite and grass pollens in allergic asthma in children. These fungi are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, <b>conjunctivitis</b> and atopic dermatitis. The most important source of allergens are microscopic fungi of the genus Alternaria and Cladosporium followed Penicillium and Aspergillus. Less frequently reported types and species of fungi can be difficult to diagnose because they are absent in sets of diagnostic skin prick tests and immunoglobulin E-specific panels. Microscopic fungi are often more important allergens in children than adults, also they more often cause severe exacerbations of asthma in children. Additional problem of the allergy diagnosis is realted to the lack of the standardization of extracts used in skin tests. Treatment of asthma caused by allergens of fungi do not differ significantly from the therapy of asthma induced by other allergens. The most diserable causal treatment would be allergen specific immunotherapy for mold, however, it is not sufficiently well established. Compared to other allergens it has not been confirmed by sufficient number of studies, especially among children...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate recombinant Bet v I, the major birch pollen allergen for in vivo and in vitro diagnosis of birch pollen allergy. METHODS: A group of 51 birch pollen allergic patients and eight non-allergic control individuals were tested for birch pollen allergy by skin-prick and intradermal testing, comparing commercial birch pollen extracts with recombinant Bet v I. Quantitative and qualitative serological testing was done with natural and recombinant allergens by radioallergosorbent test (RAST), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Recombinant Bet v I allowed accurate in vivo and in vitro diagnosis of tree pollen allergy in 49 / 51 patients tested. No false positive results were obtained in any in vitro assay system (ELISA, Western blot) or by skin testing (skin-prick, intradermal test) with recombinant Bet v I. CONCLUSION: Our results document that recombinant Bet v I produced in bacterial expression systems allows accurate in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of birch pollen allergy in > 95 % of birch pollen allergic patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundPollen is an {{important}} trigger of <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and/or asthma, and an exacerbating factor in atopic dermatitis. Although it is proposed that protease activity from allergen sources, such as mites, enhances allergenicity, little information is available on that from relevant allergenic pollens such as Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress pollens, which are the major cause of pollinosis in Japan. MethodsWe analyzed the protease activities derived from allergenic pollen of Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, and Rocky mountain juniper, which belong to the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family, and white birch and short ragweed, using synthetic substrates and class-specific inhibitors. ResultsWe found that the pollen of the {{three members of the}} Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family contained serine protease activity, that the pollen of white birch and short ragweed contained not only serine protease activity but also cysteine protease activity, that all five types of pollen tested contained at least one other type of serine protease, whose sensitivity to a serine protease-specific inhibitor was relatively low, and that the content and releasability of the pollen-derived proteases differed according to the plant families. ConclusionsClinically relevant allergenic pollens tested in the present study can release serine and/or cysteine endopeptidases. Information on the spectrum of the endopeptidase activities from these allergenic pollen grains will be useful for investigating their contribution to the pathogenesis of allergies...|$|R
