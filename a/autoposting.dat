Drawing on thirty-six semi-structured interviews, I employ a qualitative methodology that seeks {{to bridge the gap}} between critical theorisations of algorithmic personalisation and the negotiations of web users themselves who encounter algorithmic personalisation in everyday life. To do this I focus on three sites of investigation. I first examine privacy tool Ghostery and the ways in which Ghostery users’ negotiate their positions as data-tracked subjects, especially in relation to privacy, knowledge and their sense of self. I then investigate Facebook’s <b>autoposting</b> apps as examples of algorithmic personalisation that act on the user’s behalf, and draw on the accounts of Facebook app users to explore themes such as identity performance, autonomous control and algorithmic governance. Finally I examine users’ engagement with the ‘predictive powers’ (Google Now, 2014) of the personalisation app Google Now, specifically in regards to notions of user trust, expectation and speculation. My critical enquiries produced a number of themes that tie this thesis together. Central were: the epistemic uncertainties that emerged as trust and anxiety in participant responses; the implications for a performative understanding of selfhood when algorithmic personalisation intervenes in user self-articulation; the (asymmetrical) data-for-services exchange which web users must negotiate with commercial data trackers; and the struggle for autonomy between user and system that algorithmic personalisation creates. The thesis also argues that algorithmic personalisation demands that web users’ identities be constituted as both a stable and fixable ‘single identity’, but also as recursively reworkable, dividualised and endlessly expressable entities...|$|E

40|$|The <b>AUTOPOST</b> project {{participates in}} H 2020 pilot action on open access to {{research}} data. This deliverable, the <b>AUTOPOST</b> data management plan, describes the research data {{that will be}} collected and generated during the project and explains {{how it will be}} exploited or if it will be shared for verification and re-use. <b>AUTOPOST</b> is an industry-driven innovation action that will deliver ICT-based solutions to enhance established post-production workflows. As most of the project outcomes are susceptible of being protected for exploitation, this data management plan will clearly identify which data will be kept confidential and which will be made openly available. This document describes the data, how it will be created, how it will be stored and backed-up, who owns it and who is responsible for the different data. The <b>AutoPost</b> management Plan will be updated as the project progresses...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} different aspects {{related to the}} design, development and launch of the <b>AUTOPOST</b> web site {{as part of the}} overall dissemination tasks included in WP 6, task 1. This report is intended to accompany the actual D 6. 1, which is the <b>AUTOPOST</b> project website put online since March 1 st, 2015. The website is composed basically of a set of static pages containing the information about the project objectives, members of the consortium, contact, etc. and two sections which will require continuous updates, news and outcomes. All the website is based in a blog engine, WordPress, to facilitate the posting, search and update of contents. The website is publicly available from M 2, February, 2015, at the URL: [URL] There is also a restricted access web based repository for easy exchange of information among partners at [URL] Section 1 describes the <b>AUTOPOST</b> website as published in March 1 st, 2015. It also describes the future actions with regard to updating contents and layout. Section 2 contains a detail account of the specifications given to the website designer and programmer...|$|R
40|$|This {{deliverable}} is {{the initial}} {{version of the}} plan for disseminating the activities and the generated knowledge and results of the <b>AUTOPOST</b> project. The <b>AUTOPOST</b> dissemination plan is designed to: 	Build an active community of interest around the project results. 	Disseminate information about the technical progress and results to the media industry and research communities, through conferences, fairs and scholarly publications. 	Provide opportunities for feedback from potential users of the <b>AutoPost</b> tools, through pre-commercial demonstrations and workshop sessions. This document also covers the information the project intends to disseminate, the identified target audience, and {{the list of the}} dissemination activities, including: project brand development, development and publishing of a web site, promotion of the publication of scientific communications and presentations in conferences, design and publishing of printed materials, generation of briefings and reports, courses and other teaching and demonstration activities, establishment of relations with other research projects, one-to-one relationships and promotion of the active participation in conferences and fairs. The initial schedule of activities and the introduction to the assessment plan are included. This plan will be updated as the project progresses...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this deliverable is to report about the dissemination of the project results to creative professionals and research communities in the film, broadcast, and advertisement sectors. The initial plan was to organize a dissemination workshop as the primary way of presenting the project results. During the project {{it was decided to}} focus on the presentation of the <b>AUTOPOST</b> project by means of a project booth in the two major trade fairs in the post-production sector, the IBC 2015 and the NAB 2016. This was due to the great opportunities aroused when <b>AUTOPOST</b> was invited to these events taking into account the total alignment of the objectives of <b>AUTOPOST</b> dissemination plan with the impact provided by the participation in the fairs. As a final deliverable for dissemination tasks, this deliverable includes the final dissemination plan followed during the project (updating the information of D 6. 2), and the several dissemination activities carried out during the project. This covers the creation of the particular means and tools for disseminating the project, such as the corporative image, the website, the Vimeo channel or the Zenodo repository; the creation of dissemination material, leaflet, poster, dissemination videos and press releases; the different scientific publications made; and the contributions to the Open Data Pilot. Finally this deliverable reports the active participation in events and its impact, and collaborations made...|$|R
