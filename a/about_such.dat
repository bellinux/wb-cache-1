5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result <b>about</b> <b>such</b> fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions <b>about</b> <b>such</b> sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E

She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, {{but it was never}} issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media <b>about</b> <b>such</b> behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E
5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information <b>about</b> <b>such</b> hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E
5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped {{it along the}} tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to the tracks. Growing public concern <b>about</b> <b>such</b> dumping led {{to the adoption of}} a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars with such a system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways the federal government can prevent such tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS <b>about</b> <b>such</b> prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season <b>about</b> <b>such</b> complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. Simpson had been thinking <b>about</b> <b>such</b> an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth icon in India. Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention for wearing a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively. Such performances garnered negative attention because of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements <b>about</b> <b>such</b> practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author Salman Rushdie. Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen. Riya's public persona is compared to her mother Moon Moon, who was seen as a sex symbol of her time, while her sister Raima is mostly compared to their grandmother Suchitra.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{was born}} and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, {{with whom he had}} three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a {{successful}} career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation <b>about</b> <b>such</b> matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions <b>about</b> <b>such</b> average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive <b>about</b> <b>such</b> a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E
5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} <b>about</b> <b>such</b> a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
