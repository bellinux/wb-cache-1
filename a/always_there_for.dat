25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are <b>always</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{television}} reviewer Hayden Childs {{commented that}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] was [...] "somewhat amusing {{and far more}} coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough." [...] Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this {{one out of the}} park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening the best {{in the history of the}} show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. <b>Always</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> us with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits." ...|$|E

Bill Bradley for the New York Times Book Review wrote of Red and Me [...] "Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but {{on the subject of}} his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he’s loud and clear." [...] In the book itself Russell wrote [...] "Whenever I leave the Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn't be good enough because anywhere else is a step down...

While Kim has been jealous of Ron's girlfriends at times, Ron values their friendship too much to jeopardize it by confessing his true feelings for her until the third season, at the end of which they finally start dating. Sarah Freymiller of Bustle described Ron as [...] "the Joker to [...] Batman; he is the intelligent, kind chaos in her highly-organized life." [...] Meanwhile, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed observed, [...] " [...] At the end of the day, Kim needs Ron, and Ron is <b>always</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> her and never feels emasculated by the fact his friend/girlfriend is clearly better than him at everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{the present}} time, I suppose, {{there is no}} one who doubts that {{histories}} which appertain to any {505} other people than the Jews, and their spiritual progeny in the first century, fall within the second class of the three enumerated. Like Goethe's Autobiography, they might all be entitled [...] "Wahrheit und Dichtung"--"Truth and Fiction." [...] The proportion of the two constituents changes indefinitely; {{and the quality of the}} fiction varies through the whole gamut of unveracity. But [...] "Dichtung" [...] is <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> the most acute and learned of historians cannot remedy the imperfections of his sources of information; nor can the most impartial wholly escape the influence of the [...] "personal equation" [...] generated by his temperament and by his education. Therefore, from the narratives of Herodotus to those set forth in yesterday's Times, all history is to be read subject to the warning that fiction has its share therein. The modern vast development of fugitive literature cannot be the unmitigated evil that some do vainly say it is, since it has put an end to the popular delusion of less press-ridden times, that what appears in print must be true. We should rather hope that some beneficent influence may create among the erudite a like healthy suspicion of manuscripts and inscriptions, however ancient; for a bulletin may lie, even though it be written in cuneiform characters. Hotspur's starling, that was to be taught to speak nothing but [...] "Mortimer" [...] into the ears of King Henry the Fourth, might be a useful inmate of every historian's library, if [...] "Fiction" [...] were substituted for the name of Harry Percy's friend. {506} ...|$|E
