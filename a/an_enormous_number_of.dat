All network entities, i. e., nodes and networks, behave in a self-organizing manner, where the global behavior emerges through their operation on local information and direct and/or indirect mutual interaction intra- and inter-layers. We show several results to demonstrate how self-organizing network control behaves based on our architecture.

It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have become intertwined {{over the past}} few decades in a “syndemic ” that exacerbates the morbidity and mortality associated with each pathogen alone. The severity of the coinfection has been extensively examined in clinical studies. The extrap-olation of peripheral evidence from clinical studies has increased our basic understanding of how HIV increases susceptibility to TB. These studies have resulted in multiple hypotheses of how HIV exacerbates TB pathology through the manipulation of granulomas. Granulomas can be located in many tissues, most prominently the lungs and associated lymph nodes, and are made up of multiple immune cells that can actively containM. tuberculosis. Granuloma-based research involving both animal models and clinical studies is needed to confirm these hypotheses, which will further our understanding of this coinfection and may lead to better treatment options.
