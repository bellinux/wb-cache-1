25|$|The {{top-down}} approach anticipates nanodevices {{that must be}} built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. <b>Atomic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopes</b> and scanning tunneling microscopes {{can be used to}} look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E
