50|$|Another type of wheel cover, {{the static}} wheel fairing, was {{introduced}} by BBS for Ferrari at the British Grand Prix {{to act as a}} brake cooling aid for front wheels whilst remaining stationary the wheel itself with one part being cut out at a 27Â° angle to enable hot air to escape and thus became adopted by every team. The wheel covers were banned from use in F1 from 2010 after incidents where they broke loose in races. To get around the ban, Ferrari used a detachable integral <b>aero</b> <b>device</b> made from the same magnesium material as the wheel itself, which consisted of double concentric rings of different diameter. As parts of cars how have to be homologated, its rivals were unable to copy this device. Its use became eliminated when the FIA revised the regulations for 2011 to prohibit wheel materials in certain exclusion zones.|$|E

40|$|A Working Group Meeting on Heavy Vehicle Aerodynamic Drag {{was held}} at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California on May 12 th and 13 th of 2005. The purpose of the first day's meeting, May 12 th, {{was to provide a}} summary of achievements, discuss issues, present a general {{overview}} of future plans, and to offer a forum for dialogue with the Department of Energy (DOE) and representatives from industry, universities, and research and development organizations performing work related to heavy vehicle aerodynamics. This first meeting day was open to participants from industry and research organizations from both the US and Canada. The second day, May 13 th, was attended only by representatives from the 9 organizations that form the DOE Consortium effort and their government sponsors. The purpose of the second day's meeting was to further discuss fiscal year 2005 's activities, any further specific pressing issues, identify individual action items, and provide an overview of plans for fiscal year 2006. Based on discussions at the Meeting, the existing project goals remain unchanged and enhancing interactions with fleet owners and operators was emphasized: (1) Perform heavy vehicle computations and experiments, (2) Validate computations using experimental data, (3) Provide design guidance and insight into flow phenomena from experiments and computations, and (4) Investigate <b>aero</b> <b>devices</b> with emphasis on collaborative efforts with fleet owners and operators...|$|R
50|$|There was no {{restriction}} on body size and doors until 1993, {{when it was}} changed to only allow cars {{with a minimum of}} four doors and no smaller than the EuroNCAP 'Small Family Car' class, although 'Large Family Car' tends to dominate the category. Until 1995, teams were only permitted to fit aerodynamic device that were available through dealers, but that changed when, in 1994 BTCC season, Alfa Romeo entered a 155 with Gabriele Tarquini and Giampiero Simoni as drivers. The car had a front spoiler with a bottom piece that could be unscrewed and moved forward, acting as a splitter, and a rear spoiler with a pair of extensions, giving the car more downforce. When Alfa Romeo won the first five rounds, Ford, supported by Vauxhall, made a complaint to the race stewards. TOCA soon decided the <b>aero</b> <b>devices</b> were illegal and Alfa Romeo were stripped of the points they earned at Snetterton and Silverstone, though this decision was later reversed by appeal. After this point, Alfa were forced to run their spoilers in the retracted position (the position in which the spoilers were fitted on the road going version, the Alfa 155 Silverstone, though the road car was sold with two unfitted spoiler extension brackets). In the mean time, Renault and BMW responded by introducing their own limited edition road cars - to enable them to run with oversized aerodynamic aids. Soon after that, the FIA changed the regulation in all series to allow cars to only use non-production aerodynamic devices with a restricted size. Restrictions varied depending on body type, with Volvo having to revert from the 850 Estate to their four-door saloon model the following season when they found themselves to be disadvantaged by the new rules. In the Italian Supertourismo category, teams entered extended spoilers without complaints.|$|R
50|$|Changes {{were made}} for the 2009 season to {{increase}} dependency on mechanical grip and create overtaking opportunities - resulting in the return to slick tyres, a wider and lower front wing with a standardized centre section, a narrower and taller rear wing, and the diffuser being moved backwards and made taller yet less efficient at producing downforce. Overall aerodynamic grip was dramatically reduced with the banning of complex appendages such as winglets, bargeboards and other <b>aero</b> <b>devices</b> previously used to better direct airflow over and under the cars. The maximum engine speed was reduced to 18,000 rpm to increase reliability further and conform to engine life demand.Due to increasing environmental pressures from lobby groups and the like, many have called into question the relevance of Formula 1 as an innovating force towards future technological advances (particularly those concerned with efficient cars). The FIA {{has been asked to}} consider how it can persuade the sport to move down a more environmentally friendly path. Therefore, in addition to the above changes outlined for the 2009 season, teams were invited to construct a KERS device, encompassing certain types of regenerative braking systems to be fitted to the cars in time for the 2009 season. The system aims {{to reduce the amount of}} kinetic energy converted to waste heat in braking, converting it instead to a useful form (such as electrical energy or energy in a flywheel) to be later fed back through the engine to create a power boost. However unlike road car systems which automatically store and release energy, the energy is only released when the driver presses a button and is useful for up to 6.5 seconds, giving an additional 80 hp (60 kW) and 400 kJ. It effectively mimicks the 'push to pass' button from IndyCar and A1GP series. KERS was not seen in the 2010 championship - while it was not technically banned, the FOTA collectively agreed not to use it. It however made a return for the 2011 season, with all teams except HRT, Virgin and Lotus utilizing the device.|$|R
40|$|In view {{of burning}} and {{explosion}} dangerous source which exist in explosive and its manufacture, the security quantitative analysis {{model of the}} emergency open system based on the burning and explosion dangerous source evaluation method is proposed, and the system security of the emergency open system is analyzed by the burning and explosion dangerous source evaluation method. The analysis results basically show the regulation of the emergency open system security. The model and the proposed research method can provide reference for security study of other <b>aero</b> explosive <b>device</b> system. The feasibility and reliability of burning and explosion dangerous source evaluation of the emergency open system have been heightened. The security quantitative analysis model of emergency open system in virtue of burning and explosion dangerous source evaluation method {{can be a good}} method of the choice of the security design of the whole system. </p...|$|R
