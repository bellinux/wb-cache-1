6000|$|... "We {{will not}} talk of vengeance. I {{believe he is}} wretched, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am;--and that has come of the wrong that I have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} much of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am right. I cannot get out as I used to do, {{and do not}} care to meet people about business." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You <b>Know</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Do (<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>That</b> You Won't)" [...] (Peter McCann) - 3:02 ...|$|R
2500|$|Michael, you've {{got a lot}} {{to answer}} for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're gonna call... if you need me." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{the morning}} he wore a troubled look, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the hour of my triumph approached.|$|R
60|$|I {{will say}} in conclusion, that {{my share of}} the welcome to our guest is none the less hearty because I talk so much nonsense, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> curl say the same far {{the rest of the}} speakers.|$|E
60|$|April 7. Have {{stayed away}} as I said. It is a pity to ruin such an {{interesting}} investigation, {{but it would}} be a greater pity still to ruin my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot trust myself with that woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Captain Aylmer;--no. I {{cannot be}} your wife. Do not press it further; {{you must know}} that on such a subject I would think much before I {{answered}} you. I have thought much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am right." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus he wailed, {{then came}} the sound of sword blows <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this prophet was dead also.|$|R
6000|$|... "They must be fools," [...] he said. [...] "I see a sledge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{some man}} made it--for who {{ever heard of}} a sledge making itself? I see a world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Great Spirit made it, because a world cannot make itself. The {{greatest}} Spirit must be One, because two greatests are impossible, and He is good--because good is better than evil, and the Greatest includes the Best." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{something}} {{seemed to}} grip my throat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had died--for the world floated away from beneath me.|$|R
60|$|I {{leave these}} fine discriminations to the theologian. I know that I {{went back to}} my hotel in Vevey with my mind healed, with my will {{restored}} to me, and my ideas running together into plans. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had come out that day a broken and apathetic man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I {{really think}} it is hardly worth while to trouble you further in this,' {{continued}} the lady. 'He's quite good enough for a little insignificant place like mine at Knapwater; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not get on {{with one of the}} others for a single month. We'll try him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps you}} are right, perhaps you are right, my dear," [...] {{said the old}} Squire wearily. [...] "I only hope that my time may come first. I have lived here all my life, seventy years and more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not live {{anywhere}} else. But God's will be done. And now, my dear, go to bed." ...|$|E
60|$|Laughter {{came into}} her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not vexed her. But I had spoken stupidly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reddened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Also I had a {{regard for}} Mr. Eustace Meeson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{he had lost}} his {{inheritance}} through a quarrel about myself." ...|$|R
60|$|But, as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that,</b> {{with the}} {{exception}} of the last sentence, was not the truth of the matter at all.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I've seen anything, God knows I couldn't {{have seen}} it but for you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't have said it except to you. You seemed to make {{everything}} clear for a minute; but I don't practice what I preach. You would help me.... There are only us two {{in the world for}} all purposes, and--and you like to have me with you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have {{destroyed}} your life,--and his. I know I {{ought not to}} have married him, because you bade me not. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have been gentler with him, and more obedient, when I was his wife. I sometimes wish that I were a Catholic, and that I could go into a convent, and bury it all amidst sackcloths and ashes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I've seen anything, God knows I couldn't {{have seen}} it but for you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't have said it except to you.

6000|$|... “I {{will wait}} here till morning, Will. There {{will be no}} {{hardship}} in <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you don’t like speaking to anyone.” ...|$|R
60|$|Prof. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> will. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my lords {{that are}} there {{will be glad to}} hear it, and to see you also.|$|R
6000|$|... "She won't say a word," [...] {{came from}} Sam [...] "She said she didn't feel well, <b>that's</b> all; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> wasn't true altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are splendid," [...] {{she said}} softly. [...] "If he thought so--but no--I am sure he doesn't. He's {{just coming out}} here like a martyr going to the stake. He knows he will be {{expected}} to propose to me when he gets here. And he knows that I know it too. And he knows <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will be expected to}} say my very prettiest 'yes.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] {{returned}} Florida, [...] "for I {{have thought}} it all over many times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not to blame, though at first I blamed myself. I never intended him anything but good. That is my consolation, Mr. Ferris. But you," [...] she added, [...] "you seem to make yourself my judge. Well, {{and what do you}} blame me for? I {{have a right to know}} what is in your mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{cried the}} Su-dic scornfully. [...] "You can't make me obey your laws, I assure you. I know {{the extent of}} your powers, Princess Ozma of Oz, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am more {{powerful}} than you are. To prove it I shall keep you and your companion prisoners in this mountain until after we have fought and conquered the Skeezers. Then, if you promise to be good, I may let you go home again." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to a plenary question on the UN's role in regards to cholera in Haiti at the International Peace Institute, Bokova responded, [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about this problem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is a legal process that is being engaged in currently. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> {{the details of this}} legal process, <b>I</b> just <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is going there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is an idea to establish a fund for indemnities. I will be advocating also for this action to be taken." ...|$|R
60|$|Reginald {{puckered}} {{his brow}} into a tortured frown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> my point was gained. He was debating what tie {{would go with}} which waistcoat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she went}} on laughing, [...] "you will get very little to eat for your pains, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{soldiers}} always like good dinners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost as {{unlikely}} as you are. One has to risk {{dangers in}} the world, but one makes the risk {{as little as}} possible. I know they won't give me a pony that will tumble down; and I know that I've told you to look {{to see that they}} don't. You chose the pony, but I had to choose you. I don't know very much about ponies, but I do know something about a lover, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have got one that will suit me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} explain what I mean, but sometimes--it {{may be at}} night, or when I am sitting alone in the daytime--a great calm comes upon me, and I am a changed woman. All my {{thoughts}} rise into a higher, purer air, and are, as it were, tinged with a reflected light; everything earthly seems to pass away from me, and I feel as though fetters had fallen from my soul, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am near my mother. Then everything passes, and I am left myself again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They trouble me not at all," [...] {{the priest}} said. [...] "Men come, {{sometimes}}. They may be robbers, {{or they may}} not. I ask no questions. They sometimes bring fruit and other offerings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need not fear them. I have nought to lose, save my life; {{and he would be}} indeed an evil man who would dare to lift his finger against a priest--one who harms not anyone, and is ready to share what food he has with any man who comes to him hungry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{but this}} will be a picture,--a real picture; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Kami will let me send it to the Salon. You don't mind, do you?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that he was interested, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> spoke he had looked through the window and seen the man writing the letter.|$|R
