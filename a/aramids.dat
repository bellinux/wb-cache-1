The LiCl/DMAc {{was used}} as solvent system to {{dissolve}} meta-aramid short fiber, the <b>aramid</b> fibrid was prepared by injecting the <b>aramid</b> solution into the high shearing coagulant at room temperature and the mixture of water and N, N-dimethylacetamide(DMAc) {{was used as}} coagulant. The <b>aramid</b> fibrid and <b>aramid</b> short fiber were mixed at differents weight proportion, wet paper was dried and <b>aramid</b> paper was prepared by heat pressing. The <b>aramid</b> paper has excellent mechanical properties when the weight proportion of the <b>aramid</b> fibrid and <b>aramid</b> short fiber was 60 : 40 ，and it had a good thermal bonding between the fibrid and fiber under heat pressing. The hydrophobic SiO 2 was mixed with <b>aramid</b> fibrid and <b>aramid</b> short fiber (60 : 40) in ethanol, and aramid/aerogel composite was prepared by drying and hot compressing.

40|$|Abstract: para-Aramid fibers {{are very}} tough and strong polymer materials. They {{are widely used}} for the {{manufacture}} of high-performance industrial textiles. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} different concentrations of <b>aramid</b> sta-ple fibers on the mechanical properties of wool/PET/aramid blended spun yarn and fabric. Three different fiber com-positions were used to produce <b>aramid</b> fabrics with <b>aramid</b> fiber contents of 0 − 10 %. We measured the mechanical properties of these <b>aramid</b> blended fabrics: the tensile strength, wear strength, and fastness against washing, friction, and daylight. The tensile test results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the <b>aramid</b> blended fabric change with the amount of <b>aramid</b> staple fibers. In particular, 6 % <b>aramid</b> blended fabrics showed the best physical properties, but higher <b>aramid</b> concentrations produced no further changes. One reason could be the decrease in mechanical prop-erties due to the low cohesion stress of individual <b>aramid</b> fibers. In conclusion, a woven fabric made of 3 − 6 % arami...|$|R

2500|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{landmark in}} the commercial production of polyethylene began {{with the development of}} catalyst that promoted the polymerization at mild temperatures and pressures. The first of these was a chromium trioxide–based catalyst discovered in 1951 by Robert Banks and J. Paul Hogan at Phillips Petroleum. In 1953 the German chemist Karl Ziegler developed a catalytic system based on titanium halides and organoaluminium compounds that worked at even milder conditions than the Phillips catalyst. The Phillips catalyst is less expensive and easier to work with, however, and both methods are heavily used industrially. By the end of the 1950s both the Phillips- and Ziegler-type catalysts were being used for HDPE production. In the 1970s, the Ziegler system was improved by the incorporation of magnesium chloride. [...] Catalytic systems based on soluble catalysts, the metallocenes, were reported in 1976 by Walter Kaminsky and Hansjörg Sinn. The Ziegler- and metallocene-based catalysts families have proven to be very flexible at copolymerizing ethylene with other olefins and have become the basis for the wide range of polyethylene resins available today, including very low density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene. Such resins, in the form of UHMWPE fibers, have (as of 2005) begun to replace <b>aramids</b> in many high-strength applications.|$|E

The most popular product of this kind is Nomex. Nomex has less strength than Kevlar, but it has extremely high heat, flame, ultraviolet, chemical, and radiation resistance. Meta <b>aramids</b> are commonly found in firefighting equipment, as well as military pilot suits and helmets.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent or {{minimise}} skin burn damage resulting from high temperature, a kind of thermal insulation composite fabric, the surface of which is aluminised, was developed. In this study, the thermal insulation properties of aluminised <b>aramid</b> fabrics were investigated. The reflectance of <b>aramid</b> fabrics and aluminised <b>aramid</b> fabrics were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The reflectance of <b>aramid</b> fabric increased from 63. 6 % to 92. 3 % {{as a result of}} aluminising. The thermal insulation of aluminised fabrics and nonaluminised fabrics was measured using a dry hot plate instrument, where the aluminised fabrics had a higher thermal resistance than those non-aluminised, and the thermal resistance of <b>aramid</b> fabric could be enhanced by almost 45 % when aluminised. The aluminised and non-aluminised fabrics were exposed to a hot environment for a few minutes using self-designed apparatus. The results showed that the aluminised <b>aramid</b> fabrics had better thermal insulation performance than the non-aluminised <b>aramid</b> ones.

40|$|The {{limitation}} of <b>aramid</b> fiber is its surface property, {{which results in}} its very poor interfacial adhesion to most of commercial resins.

The results showed that the surface morphology of <b>aramid</b> fabrics did not undergo an obvious change; the wicking effect increased slightly with an increase in ozone treatment time; the tenacity and elongation of <b>aramid</b> fibers and fabrics did not significant change after ozone treatment, but the tenacity and elongation of <b>aramid</b> yarns showed significant improvement after ozone treatment, and increased with the increase of ozone treatment time; the ball bursting load and penetration displacement had a slight increase as well after ozone treatment. Therefore, ozone treatment could be one method to improve the surface property of the <b>aramid</b> fiber...|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the bonding {{properties}} between poly (m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) fibers and PMIA-pulp and to improve the mechanical strength of <b>aramid</b> sheets, PMIA fibers have been treated with various chemical modifying agents.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{surveys the}} {{physical}} properties of <b>aramid</b> and aramid/nylon hybrid air-jet textured yarns(ATY) for protective garments according to {{wet and dry}} texturing conditions. <b>Aramid</b> and nylon filaments were used to make two kinds of para-aramid ATY and four kinds of aramid/nylon hybrid ATY with dry and wet treatments. The analyzed physical properties of six specimens (made on the ATY machine) are as follows. The tenacity and initial modulus of <b>aramid</b> and aramid/nylon hybrid ATY decreased with the wetting and breaking strain; however, the yarn linear density of <b>aramid</b> and hybrid ATY increased with wetting treatment. The dry and wet thermal shrinkage of the hybrid ATY increased with wet-ting. The stability of <b>aramid</b> and hybrid ATY also increased with wetting. The physical properties of core/effect type hybrid ATY showed significantly more change than the core type hybrid ATY and the physical properties of nylon/aramid core/ effect hybrid ATY showedsignificantly more change than the of aramid/nylon core/effect hybrid ATY. A higher bulky and breaking strain of hybrid ATY require ATY processing conditions of nylon on the core part with wetting and <b>aramid</b> on the effect part. ATY processing conditions for nylon and <b>aramid</b> on the core part with wetting are required for a higher tenacity and modulus.
