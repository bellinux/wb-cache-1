In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the rate of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> the court's workload.|$|E
5|$|The Act left range {{management}} policy unresolved in many respects, {{although it did}} specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range {{was said to have}} increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level, but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had <b>actually</b> <b>increased.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E

5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland <b>actually</b> <b>increased</b> during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.|$|E

Similarly, the number of one-year-olds fully immunized against measles rose from 30% in 1985–1990 to 40% in 2000–2005, and for tuberculosis, it grew nearly 20% from 31% to 50% over the same period.|$|E
