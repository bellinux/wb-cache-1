5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an <b>air</b> <b>lock,</b> pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport {{has been described}} as similar to an <b>air</b> <b>lock.</b> When the ligand is bound, it is hypothesized to close the pore at the extracellular side, thus preventing anything from exiting through the pore. FepA then interacts with TonB through a 5 amino acid consensus sequence, which induces a change to the N-terminal opening a channel to the periplasmic side. This would allow FepA to transport ferric-enterobactin without allowing ions and small molecules from passing in either direction.|$|E

50|$|The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was an {{incubator}} used in {{the treatment}} of respiratory distress among newly born infants in the 1950s. The device was developed by Dr. Allan Bloxsom, a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas. At its peak, the device was utilized in more than 700 hospitals. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> produced unfavorable results in a 1956 clinical trial. By that time physicians had also become leery of the link between high-concentration oxygen and eye disease in premature babies, and the device fell out of favor. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> is sometimes cited as an example of technology that gained wide acceptance following inadequate evaluation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|R

50|$|Bloxsom {{developed}} the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device {{based on his}} assumptions {{about the role of}} uterine contractions in establishing effective breathing at birth. The <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was a sealed steel cylinder that delivered warmed and humidified 60% oxygen to newly born babies. The device has been compared to an iron lung, but it did not utilize negative pressure. The pressure inside the chamber alternated between 0.07 and 0.2 atmospheres above sea level. Rather than alternating the pressures at the rate of normal respirations as other devices did, the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> cycled the pressure once per minute to mimic the rate of uterine contractions in late labor. Babies in distress were placed in the chamber immediately after delivery.|$|E

40|$|Low-head bubbler {{irrigation}} systems are particularly well-suited for the irrigation of orchard crops, and these systems differ from other micor{{irrigation systems}} {{because they are}} based on gravity-flow, can operate at pressures as low as 1 meter (3. 3 ft), and do not require elaborate filtration systems. A design procedure for low-head bubbler systems is described in detail, and example designs for bubbler systems located on level ground and gradual slopes are also presented. The design procedure utilizes head loss gradient charts based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation to size the pipe diameters, and the delivery hose elevations are calculated by using a personal computer with spreadsheet software. The causes of <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> in the laterals and delivery hoses are also investigated, and minimum design flow rates for various pipe diameters are recommended to ensure flow velocities are high enough to prevent <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> from occurring within the delivery hoses...|$|R
5000|$|The {{device was}} rolled out in 1950. That year, Bloxsom {{presented}} a {{talk on the}} device at an American Medical Association conference. That led to the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> being featured in Newsweek, which referred to the device as the [...] "Plexiglass Mother". A Houston company developed a Plexiglass model. In 1952, U.S. Army physicians shared their experience with the device, writing that the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was a valuable resuscitation device and that on occasion {{it appeared to be}} lifesaving. Though the apparatus was large and loud, one pediatrician pointed out that the infant was protected from [...] "meddlesome and unintelligent treatment" [...] while locked inside the chamber. The <b>air</b> <b>lock,</b> which sold for about $1,000 per unit, was used in more than 700 hospitals by the fall of 1952.|$|E
50|$|The next year, Bloxsom and Angelique {{published}} {{an article in the}} American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology on the 48-hour mortality rate among newborns at St. Joseph. Between 1949 and 1952, this rate had decreased from 63 per 10,000 infants to 37 per 10,000 infants. Bloxsom and Angelique cited the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device as a contributor to the improvement in outcomes. However, a 1956 study from Johns Hopkins Hospital failed to show a significant difference in outcomes between infants treated in the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> versus those cared for in the Isolette brand of incubator.|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that the Blasius equation yields accurate estimates of head loss in small diameter plastic tubing and larger diameter PVC pipe for Reynolds numbers upto 100, 000. The Hazen-Williams equation with suitable roughness parameter values also predicts head loss accurately. The results of laboratory experiments reveal that the undulations which are created during field installation are {{the primary cause of}} <b>air</b> <b>locking</b> in the delivery hose. The additional head needed to release the trapped air was found to be equal to the sum of heights of all the undulations. If the sum of their heights exceeds the design head loss in the delivery hose, <b>air</b> <b>locking</b> will result. The capital investment for bubbler system under study was comparable to that of a pressurized drip system. Long term savings in terms of energy and maintenance make low head bubbler systems an attractive alternative to pressurized drip systems for irrigating orchards or vineyards...|$|R
