5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he lived and moved and had his being was {{saturated}} with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking....

5|$|Although the Germans {{expected}} another Allied {{landing in}} the Mediterranean, the advancing Red Army and the Allied landings in Normandy placed great strains on German resources, so little was done to improve the condition of Army Group G, which was occupying Southern France. Given the advancing Allied forces in northern France, the Germans deemed a realistic defense in the south impossible. Johannes Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern France in July and August with the German High Command, but the 20 July plot led to an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> any withdrawal {{was out of the}} question. Blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces, any serious Allied landing attempt would be impossible to ward off. He planned a withdrawal in secret, to include demolition of the ports and proceeding in an orderly manner, covered by the 11th Panzer Division. He intended to establish a new defense line centered on Dijon in central France. German intelligence was aware of the impending Allied landing, and on 13August Blaskowitz ordered the 11th Panzer Division to move east of the Rhône River, where the landing was expected.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{approach}} to kingship {{was rooted in}} his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration {{of which can be}} found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, Edward III, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of {{power in the hands of}} the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly <b>atmosphere</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.|$|E

The two-stroke pistons directly drove air compressor pistons to make a positive displacement gas generator. Opposed pistons were connected by linkages instead of crankshafts. Several of these units could be connected to provide power gas to one large output turbine. The overall thermal efficiency was roughly twice that of a simple gas turbine. This system was derived from Raúl Pateras Pescara's work on free-piston engines in the 1930s.|$|R

25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
40|$|Equivalent widths {{determined}} from photoelectric scans of Venus CO 2 absorption lines measured at phase angles of 5. 1 to 170 deg are presented.

25|$|Cosmic rays {{also cause}} {{elemental}} transmutation in the <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> secondary radiation {{generated by the}} cosmic rays combines with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to generate different nuclides. Many so-called cosmogenic nuclides can be produced, but probably the most notable is carbon-14, which is produced by interactions with nitrogen atoms.

The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.|$|E

25|$|Franz {{argues that}} the threat of {{expulsion}} for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile <b>atmosphere</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence. The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives. Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism among the Witnesses; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior. Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.|$|E
40|$|Radiative-convective {{equilibrium}} {{models of}} planetary atmospheres are discussed {{for the case}} when the infrared opacity {{is due to a}} vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase. For a grey gas, or for a gas which absorbs at all infrared wavelengths, equilibrium is impossible when the solar constant exceeds a critical value. Equilibrium therefore requires that the condensed phase evaporates into the atmosphere. Moist adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic <b>atmospheres</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the condensing vapor is a major atmospheric constituent are considered. This situation would apply if the solar constant were supercritical with respect to an abundant substance such as water.

40|$|Abstract: The {{kinetic energy}} of lift car will be {{consumed}} by the friction between the safety gear and guide rail in emergent braking process. This will lead to remarkable temperate increase of frictional surface. Due to the explosive <b>atmospheres</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the explosive-proof lift servers, the high temperature may result in severe explosion accident. In this paper, an finite element model is developed to analysis this progress. The transient heat flux density is derived from energy transformation progress in safety gear action, and applied as boundary condition to the finite element model. Experiments are carried out to measure the temperature increase of safety gear frictional surface, and the results show good coincidence of temperature increase tendency between experiments and simulations...|$|R
25|$|While visiting Day in Maine in 1910 White found a small, {{run-down}} cabin near Day's property, and {{he convinced}} the owner {{to sell it}} to him for almost nothing. He then purchased a piece of property nearby and had the cabin moved to his new land. After the cabin was rebuilt and enlarged, White established the Seguinland School of Photography on the site. Named after a nearby hotel, Seguinland was the first independent school of photography in America. White asked his friend Max Weber to teach with him, and his colleagues Day and later Käsebier critiqued student work {{at the end of each}} summer session. Attracted by White's reputation and by the modest tuition costs, the first students to the school came from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Ecuador and Egypt. One-, two-, and four-week sessions were priced at $20, $30 and $50 respectively. In keeping with White's nature, the students at Seguinland enjoyed an informal, family-like <b>atmosphere</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> White and his wife took his classes on picnics and outings along the seashore. Seguinland lasted until 1915, when the responsibilities of running White's newly established school in New York overwhelmed his financial ability to keep the Maine school going.|$|E
