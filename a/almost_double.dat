5|$|Meanwhile, {{the troops}} of Urquiza and Eugenio Garzón had {{surrounded}} {{the army of}} Oribe near Montevideo. Their forces numbered roughly 15,000 men, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> Oribe's 8,500. Realising that the Brazilians were approaching and knowing {{that there was no}} hope of victory, Oribe orderered his troops to surrender without a fight on 19 October, and retreated into seclusion on his farm in Paso del Molino.|$|E
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} no obvious reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the original cost and made them more expensive {{than any of the other}} monitors.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Koldun {{began on}} 9 November 1863 by the Belgian firm of Cockerill for {{assembly}} in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 9 December 1863 {{and she was}} launched on 8 May 1864. She entered service on 1865 and cost a total of 1,237,000 rubles, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion and she, and all of her sister ships except , made a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} began on 13 June 1863 by S. G. Kudriavtsev at the {{state-owned}} Galeryni Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Edinorog was laid down on 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 2 June 1864. She entered service on 27 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,141,800 rubles, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> her contract cost of 600,000 rubles.

5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E

5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the flight range. The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|A special Ballon d'Or, {{under the}} name Super Ballon d'Or, was awarded to Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1989, after he surpassed Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini in France Footballs voting. A decade later, France Football elected Pelé the Football Player of the Century after {{consulting}} their former Ballon d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes; Stanley Matthews, Omar Sívori and George Best abstained, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di Stéfano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pelé was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the number of points earned by the runner-up, Diego Maradona.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> {{that of the}} old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E

50|$|An {{especially}} technologically interesting case of {{this comes}} when one uses a Halbach array instead of a single pole permanent magnet, as this <b>almost</b> <b>doubles</b> the field strength, which in turn <b>almost</b> <b>doubles</b> {{the strength of the}} eddy currents. The net effect is to more than triple the lift force. Using two opposed Halbach arrays increases the field even further.|$|R

5|$|Christchurch {{has one of}} {{the oldest}} populations in the country with {{significant}} proportion of residents wealthy senior citizens. The percentage of the population aged over 65 in Christchurch is 30.4%, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the national average of 16.5%. Highcliffe on the borough's eastern boundary possesses the highest percentage of elderly residents in the entire United Kingdom at 69%. The Office for National Statistics predicted that by 2031, the percentage of residents over 65 will rise to 37.9. In 2005, the life expectancy of female residents was 83.4 years and male residents 79.7 years. This was an increase on ten years previous (1995) when the life expectancy was 82.6 years and 77.0 years for females and males respectively.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} began on 17 June 1863 at the Carr and MacPherson Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Latnik was laid down on 24 December 1863 and she was {{launched}} on 22 March 1864. She entered service on 14 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 rubles, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion. For some reason, she was the only ship of the class not to make a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865. She suffered some sort of hull damage in September, but the details are not known.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the number {{some of the}} earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{made their}} first £100,000 signing in August 1962 with the {{transfer}} of Denis Law from Torino for £110,000, a new British record. The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7million, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> their previous record of £3.75million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier. In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice {{in the space of}} a month, first paying PSV £19million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then £28.1million to Lazio for Juan Sebastián Verón.|$|E
5|$|Many butterflies, such as {{the painted}} lady, monarch, and several danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place {{over a number of}} generations and no single {{individual}} completes the whole trip. The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle — <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.|$|E

5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E
5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames {{was an old}} frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, which meant that the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns and weighing <b>almost</b> <b>double</b> the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an identification signal and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes did not respond to the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E
