5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of the Solar System, and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

25|$|Extreme penalties. The maximum {{penalty for}} failing to file an FBAR is $100,000 or 50% {{of the value of}} the account, {{whichever}} is greater for each unfiled report. Because the statute of limitations period is six years, the maximum penalty is essentially 300% of the maximum account balances. Another penalty of $10,000 or more may apply if the person does not report the same account on Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets.

500|$|The {{religious}} {{importance of}} Etchmiadzin slowly recovered during the Second World War. The Holy See's official magazine resumed publication in 1944, while the seminary was reopened in September 1945. In 1945 Catholicos Gevorg VI was elected after the seven-year vacancy of the position. The number of baptisms conducted at Etchmiadzin rose greatly: from 200 in 1949 to around 1,700 in 1951. Nevertheless, the cathedral's role was downplayed by the Communist official circles. [...] "For them the ecclesiastical Echmiadzin belongs irrevocably to the past, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> monastery and the cathedral are occasionally {{the scene of}} impressive ceremonies including {{the election of a}} new catholicos, this has little importance from the communist point of view," [...] wrote Walter Kolarz in 1961.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the {{inscription}} over the door.

[...] Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his Historical Memoires (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay. Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard say the Monks worshipped [...] "the Goddess". Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments.

Barry Walters from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "Jonas Akerlund's 2005 kinetic yet personable documentary of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person. The bonus live CD proves that she's a better singer." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic complimented the release saying [...] "as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done."

[...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering {{more than an hour}} of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home." [...] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release.|$|E

[...] Ryan Dennehy of AbsolutePunk rated the album a 70-percent, stating that [...] "Yours Truly is more tempered {{and less likely to}} put you in a beaming state of catatonia" [...] that is [...] "a missive containing some of her most personal thoughts and her oft-regrettable youthful impulses." [...] At Pitchfork, Andrew Ryce rated the album a 6.5 out of ten, calling it [...] "a very safe record." [...] Lewis Conner of Digital Spy rated the album four stars out of five, writing how [...] "The production feels fresh, the lyrics are relatable and the melodies are as cool and sweet as a dollop of raspberry ripple", and where he also states that [...] "The tone and pace of the album rarely changes, but the songs feel accomplished, polished and vibrant". Corner concluded by calling [...] "Yours Truly" [...] a [...] "little less than a triumph." [...] At The Michigan Daily, Gregory Hicks graded the album a B, saying [...] "most tracks are of quality composition, lyrically and melodically, but beat usage becomes excessive at times."
