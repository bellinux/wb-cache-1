An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides <b>and</b> <b>roof,</b> as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E

5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge.

Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house <b>and</b> <b>roof,</b> as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E

5|$|In response, English Heritage and Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council {{formed a}} {{three-way}} agreement in 1988 with the Ivanhoe Trust, a local charity designed to generate new {{employment in the}} region. Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre {{was built in the}} style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors <b>and</b> <b>roof</b> of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework.|$|E
5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back.

Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior <b>and</b> <b>roof</b> {{of the original}} 1931 building as a Seattle city landmark, having approved a recommendation from the Landmarks Preservation Board. The move was prompted by a long-term proposal from The Seattle Times Company to redevelop their land in South Lake Union, {{at a cost of}} $150 million while preserving the historic character of the two buildings. The plans included two 10-story office buildings, a larger printing plant, and a multilevel parking garage.|$|E

5|$|The {{budget for}} the works was £420,000, with initial work focused on {{stabilising}} the foundations and lower masonry. Much of this was achieved through the injection of stabilising materials into the foundations, which needed time to cure and solidify.

Today, while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café, the rest is an international education centre of excellence for the Trust, training new craftsmen and restoration specialists.|$|E

Once again, and thanks to local non-profit organizations like the Wüstenrot Foundation and Community Fund for the Preservation of Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998.

5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, <b>and</b> <b>roof</b> combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
