He pointed out that under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, [...] "some 2 million of the 8-million population were killed for the sake of a political ideology that saw 'the other' as an enemy that had to be eradicated". Although [...] "Thailand is far from becoming another killing field of that scale," [...] stated Pravit, [...] "the seeds of mutual destruction are quite visible as they continue being nurtured by hate speech on social media and watered by remarks from people like Prayuth".

Inaccurate results of decomposition can occur if these conditions are not fulfilled. The improvement method consists in considering an analogy with the LF model for the glottal source and a tube model for the vocal tract. Results are presented for a sustained vowel /a / in both time and spectral domain. Future developments are also proposed.

40|$|During {{the last}} few weeks of the year 2001 a fairly old {{proposal}} to solve the debt crisis of Southern countries has regained momentum – applying the principles of domestic insolvency proceedings to sovereign states. Anne Krueger's (2001 <b>a,</b> 2001 b) <b>recent</b> <b>speeches</b> proposing to "mimick " domestic insolvency laws are a very useful contribution to the issue of debt mana-gement. Her first speech in Washington seems to have been the one falling stone taking the whole stonewall with it. Eventually this economically sensible idea has gained street credibi-lity in Wall Street. The taboo of discussing insolvency is finally overcome. Anne Krueger's speech in November 2001 followed several statements in favour of sovereign insolvency. The Secretary the US Treasury, Paul O’Neill, was the first influential politician publicly confirming the usefulness of an international insolvency procedure for sovereign governments. This idea was seconded by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and the Canadian Finance Minister, Paul Martin, a bit later. In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> paper two em-ployees of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, Andy Haldane and Mark Kruger (2001, p. 13), propose a standstill arguing that sovereign debtors need the safe harbour which bankruptcy law provides in a corporate context: "Everyone accepts this as an important part o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Human-Computer Speech {{is gaining}} {{momentum}} as a technique of computer interaction. There has been <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> upsurge in <b>speech</b> based search engines and assistants such as Siri, Google Chrome and Cortana. Natural Language Processing (NLP) {{techniques such as}} NLTK for Python {{can be applied to}} analyse speech, and intelligent responses can be found by designing an engine to provide appropriate human like responses. This type of programme is called a Chatbot, which is the focus of this study. This paper presents a survey on the techniques used to design Chatbots and a comparison is made between different design techniques from nine carefully selected papers according to the main methods adopted. These papers are representative of the significant improvements in Chatbots in the last decade. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the techniques and examines in particular the Loebner prize-winning Chatbots...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the use of}} perceptual linear prediction (PLP) analysis to observe systematic differences in spoken and sung vowels in the acoustic-auditory domain. PLP is <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> evolution of <b>speech</b> acoustic analysis that models more closely the psychophysics of hearing to derive {{an estimate of the}} auditory spectrum, and accounts for the effective second formant and 3. 5 -Bark spectral-peak integration theories of vowel perception. In the acoustic domain, the sung vowel introduces a clustering and lowering of the higher formant structure, a phenomenon called the singer’s formant. In the auditory domain, the singer’s formant has an observable effect on the frequency and bandwidth of the effective second formant, which in turns raises questions on some of the presently accepted theories on the perceptual nature of vowels and the contributions of auditory spectral regions to vowel classification...|$|R
