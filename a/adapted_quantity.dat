Micro-pressing of ground and cooked rapeseed seeds did not lead to the results usually reported in the literature for continuous pressing. The results strongly suggest that the performance of the static micro-pressing is related to the macro-and micro-structure of seeds and is less sensitive to the moisture than continuous pressing.

40|$|This work introduces, {{implements}} and evaluates different adaptive Kalman filtering techniques {{based on}} the innovation autocorrelation function. The reason of considering these adaptive techniques {{is the effect of}} a wrong noise statistics initialization in a Kalman filter and the resulting estimation errors. Of course, different noise statistics than the actual for the stochastic process under estimation would lead to significant errors. For that reason, it is interesting to have a meaning of the effect of wrong noise statistics and to <b>adapt</b> these <b>quantities</b> when necessary. The adaptive techniques considered within this work are the innovation autocorrelation based methods. The particularity of these methods is that the innovation sequence, defined as the new information introduced by the measurements, is a stationary Gaussian white noise sequence for an optimum filter. Moreover, an estimate of the autocorrelation function of that innovation sequence is obtained easily by using the ergodic property of a stationary sequence. Finally, the Kalman filter is applied to the problem of carrier-phase tracking in a GNSS receiver. Some of the algorithms are evaluated for the case of carrierphase tracking. Different scenarios from different measurement campaigns are used in this later implementation.

Techniques such as centering, noncentering and partial noncentering {{can be used to}} accelerate convergence in MCMC and EM algorithms but are still not well studied for variational Bayes (VB) methods. As a fast deterministic approach to posterior approximation, VB is attracting increasing interest due to its suitability for large high-dimensional data. Use of different parametrizations for VB has not only computational but also statistical implications, as different parametrizations are associated with different factorized posterior approximations. We examine the use of partially noncentered parametrizations in VB for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Our paper makes four contributions. First, we show how to implement an algorithm called nonconjugate variational message passing for GLMMs. Second, we show that the partially noncentered parametrization can <b>adapt</b> to the <b>quantity</b> of information in the data and determine a parametrization close to optimal. Third, we show that partial noncentering can accelerate convergence and produce more accurate posterior approximations than centering or noncentering.

Leaching of salt cake fines was by ultrasonic agitation with deionized water. The leachate was analyzed for anions by ion chromatography and for cations by ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy. Only chloride could be measured in the anions, and charge balances between cations and chloride were near unity, indicating that all major dissolved species were chloride salts.

40|$|A refined {{approach}} to residual-based error control in finite element (FE) discretizations is presented. The conventional strategies for adaptive mesh refinement in FE methods are mostly {{based on a}} posteriori error estimates in the global energy or L" 2 -norm involving local residuals of the computed solution. The mesh refinement process then aims at equilibrating these local error indicators. Such estimates reflect the approximation properties of the finite element space by local interpolation constants while the stability properties of the continuous model enter through a global stability constant, which may be known explicitly in simple cases. Meshes generated {{on the basis of}} such global error estimates may not be appropriate in cases of strongly varying coefficients and for the computation of local quantities as, for example, point values or contour integrals. More detailed information about the mechanism of error propagation can be obtained by employing duality arguments specially <b>adapted</b> to the <b>quantity</b> of interest. This results in a posteriori error estimates in which the local information derived from the dual solution is used in the form of weights multiplied by local residuals. On the basis such estimates, a feed-back process in which the weights are numerically computed with increasing accuracy leads to almost optimal meshes for various kinds of error functionals. This approach is developed here for a simple model problem, namely the Poisson equation in two dimensions, in order to emphasize its basic features. However, the underlying concept is rather universal and has, on a heuristic basis, already been successfully applied to much more complex problems in structural and fluid mechanics as well as in astrophysics.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{approach is developed}} to assess a priori the effects of irrigation management interventions on soil salinity, sodicity and transpiration. The approach is tested for a 75, 000 ha irrigation system in Pakistan, where canal and groundwater are used conjunctively. The main hypothesis is that by reallocating good quality canal water, the use of poor quality groundwater can be restricted, thus combating salinity and sodicity and mitigating their effects on crops. The study has three components. Firstly, interventions in canal water deliveries to tertiary units are analyzed using an unsteady state hydraulic model, based on the St. Venant equations, and linked with a regulation module, which captures the operational decisions of the irrigation agency. By changing the operational rules at the main canal, and by redimensioning the outlets in secondary canals, the water can be distributed equitably to tertiary units or delivered to those units that require it for salinity control. Secondly, the impact of irrigation on salinity, sodicity and transpiration is assessed for farmers' fields, using a combined soil water flow and solute transport model, based on Richard's equation and the convection-dispersion equation, and a regression equation, based on the irrigation quality and soil texture. A curvilinear relationship with a decreasing tangent {{was found between the}} irrigation quantity and soil salinity. Increases in the EC of the irrigation water result in a parallel curve with higher salinity levels. <b>Adapting</b> the irrigation <b>quantity</b> and quality to the existing soil types and depth to groundwater table can, therefore, reduce salinity and sodicity, thus avoiding soil degradation, which already occurs at an ESP of 4 %. Thirdly, both components are combined with a parallel, socio-economic study, where farmers' decisions related to the crop portfolio and acquisition/application of water, were captured in Linear Programming models. The individual models of both studies are interfaced to develop a tool, capable of quantifying the effect of irrigation management interventions. For a secondary canal serving 14, 000 ha, it is shown that the area threatened by sodicity is reduced by 40 % by reallocating canal water, without affecting the agricultural production. The results of the developed tool should not be taken as accurate predictions, as there are likely to be unforeseen events due to the complexity of irrigation systems. Instead, the approach should be evaluated for its effectiveness in supporting actors' decisions in irrigation system management, by enhancing their understanding of the effects of interventions on salinity, sodicity and agricultural production. The application of the approach, in two case studies, shows that it allows the investigation {{of a wide range of}} policy and management interventions, and captures adequately the complexity of an irrigation system, thus providing indications about its transferability. However, the tools should be applied as part of an integrated concept, which includes phases of diagnosis, identification of relevant processes and parameters, and discussions with actors...|$|R
40|$|Food {{consumption}} and assimilation efficiency of sea bream (Sparus aurata) larvae, {{during the early}} developmental stages, was studied using both an experimental and a theoretical approach. The first approach {{was based on the}} experimental estimation of the food consumption rate of the larvae, and its changes during the first 20 days after hatching. The factors related to changes in food availability affecting consumption rate such as, the duration of the daily photophase, the presence of phytoplankton during rearing and food frequency distribution were studied. Four daily photophases (8, 12, 18 and 24 hours) were tested in larval rearing experiments, under intensive conditions, which were performed in either the presence (pseudo-green water technology) or absence (clear water technology) of phytoplankton. Frequency of food distribution was tested on populations reared with the clear water technology under continuous illumination, for which food distribution was elongated to 14 hours daily (instead of 10 hours). In addition, the influence of the above factors on growth and survival of the reared populations were studied. The methodology for estimating the daily food consumption of the population was based on frequent monitoring of the changes of the concentration of zooplankton in the rearing tanks. Individual consumption was determined after estimating the daily population of fish larvae. Consumption rate was expressed in carbon units using measurements of the carbon equivalent of the plankton organisms {{as well as of the}} fish larvae. Also, formulas were developed relating larvae total length to wet weight and body carbon. The results show that both daily food {{consumption and}} consumption rate depend on rearing conditions and the duration of photophase. For individuals reared in the presence of phytoplankton, daily consumption increases with the duration of photophase while, when rearing without phytoplankton, results are reversed. Daily consumption of larvae reared with the clear water technology is from 3 to 10 times higher than the consumption level for individuals reared with the pseudo-green water technology. Food consumption rate is about 0, 4 d- 1, mg of carbon per mg body carbon, during the first period of exogenous feeding (4 th to 8 th days post-hatching) independently of the rearing conditions. As larvae grow, this rate increases, reaching a plateau the value of which varies according to the rearing conditions. For larvae reared in the presence of phytoplankton or with more frequent distribution of food, consumption rate stabilizes at about 0, 7 d- 1, independently of the duration of photophase. In the absence of phytoplankton, the food consumption rate is higher and inversely proportional to the duration of photophase (from 1, 0 to 5, 0 d- 1, for individuals reared with daily light regime of 24 and 8 hours respectively). The result is related to the efficiency of larvae to assimilate food, which in turn depends on the rearing conditions. Food assimilation efficiency varies during development. It is reduced during periods where individuals adapt either to exogenous diet or to new diet (transition from rotifer to Artemia). Maximum assimilation efficiency, about 17 % as mean value during the whole experimental period, was observed for individuals reared using the pseudo-green water technology and photophase of 18 or 24 hours. Similar results were observed for individuals reared with more frequent distribution of food. Larvae reared in the presence of phytoplankton but with 8 or 12 hours photophase exhibited lower assimilation efficiency (8. 5 and 10 % respectively). However, individuals reared using the clear water technology presented lower food assimilation efficiency with values from 2 to 8 %, for short and long photophase respectively. Observed differences are due to variations in zooplankton quality and in rearing medium, factors that are affected in the presence phytoplankton. The presence of phytoplankton in the rearing medium resulted in stability of microflora in the tanks. Microflora in tanks is directly related to the one in larvae gut that has proved to influence larvae efficiency to assimilate food. Direct action of phytoplankton on digestion has been also reported during the rearing of other species. Additionally, phytoplankton presence during rearing resulted in the preservation of rotifers both in terms of population size and also in terms of their energetic value. In rearing with the clear water technology, the carbon content of the rotifers presented a reduction of 30 % after 24 hours. The role of phytoplankton in the preservation, both quantitative and qualitative, of zooplankton was further supported by the results obtained during the experimental rearing with the extended food delivery. Concerning growth and survival of larval populations, the results of the rearing with the pseudo-green technology were better compared to those obtained with the clear water technology. The relative difference in growth after 20 days of rearing reached 25 % regarding larvae total length, while for wet weight the relative difference reached up to 100 %. Survival of the populations in presence of phytoplankton was 2 to 10 times higher than in its absence. In addition to the experimental approach a theoretical simulation of the early developmental stages of sea bream under rearing conditions was done in two ways. The first one utilizes differential equations to develop mechanistic models at the population and individual level in order to study growth and food consumption of sea bream larvae as well as the interactions between plankton and larvae populations. The second simulation uses principles of the fuzzy set theory in order to develop a model of the changes of feeding requirements of a reared population. At the population level, the study was based on the interactions between plankton and larvae populations during rearing. Models, which include simple predator - prey interactions presented limited capacity to describe the development of the system. Comparison between experimental results and the solutions of model equations showed similar evolution for populations reared with phytoplankton presence. However, the model could not describe the development of populations reared in the absence of phytoplankton. After revising the interactions between populations, and in particular the ones between phytoplankton and fish larvae, the solutions of the new system of equations described accurately growth and consumption of reared sea bream larvae. The revisions concerned the influence of phytoplankton on mortality rate and on food assimilation efficiency of the larvae. The predictions of the revised model presented a relative difference of about 10 % to experimental values for the biomass change of population reared with photophase 18 and 24 hours, independently of the rearing technology. For short photophase (8 and 12 hours), relative differences were higher although the model predicts the trend of biomass change. Concerning food consumption, the model predicted, with a relative difference of about 6 %, the experimental values of the total food consumption during the rearing period for populations reared with the pseudo-green water technology and long photophase (18 and 24 hours). For short photophase, the model predicted the general trend of food consumption change but the relative difference with the experimental values of the total consumption was high. For rearing with the clear water technology (and photophase 12, 18 and 24 hours), predicted total consumption presented relative difference of 45 % compared to the experimental values. The model however did not satisfactorily predict the trend of the changes in consumption. In contrast, for rearing with 8 hours photophase the trend of change in consumption was well predicted by the model but not the actual total consumption. The population bioenergetic model developed predicts the trend of growth and consumption evolution of sea bream larvae under different rearing conditions. Approximations used, although not precise, are correct and represent an attempt to understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the system. For the study of the bioenergetic changes in individual base, a Dynamic Energy Budget Model, which describes the biological mechanisms involved in food consumption and the utilization of the assimilated energy was developed. The model describes energy flow according to the following scheme. Consumed food is partly assimilated, and then the individual, after covering its maintenance cost, utilizes the rest. Available energy is used for growth / reproduction while a fixed part is stored and utilized when necessary. The individual utilizes a fixed fraction of the available energy for growth only when stored energy recovers its previous maximum value. Two developmental stages were determined in order to describe a sea bream larvae: i. the autotrophic stage (when individual neither feeds nor reproduces but utilizes endogenous resources) and, ii. the juvenile stage (when individual feeds but does not reproduce). Food consumption and digestion were described based on physiological and behavioral characteristics of the individuals. The model includes the possibility of simultaneous consumption of two types of preys by the individual. The model in its final form includes 3 variables and 24 parameters, the values of which were determined from bibliographical references and the experimental data from this study. Although there is a relatively large number of parameters, the solutions of the model are sensitive only to changes of those determining the food assimilation efficiency and the rate of energy utilization for maintenance. The model predicts with high accuracy (the relative difference to the experimental values are between 1 to 7 %) the growth, in terms of total length, of an individual reared with the pseudo-green water technology independently of the duration of photophase. Concerning total consumption during the rearing, the model predicts about 40 % relative difference to the experimental values. Relative difference decreases to 15 - 20 % for the period after the 10 th day post hatching, showing the inaccuracy of the model during the first period of exogenous feeding. Despite the differences, the model exhibits interesting characteristics related to the predicted growth for relatively long periods. The model can also serve as a base for further study. The lack of exact knowledge of all biological mechanisms did not allow the precise mathematical description of larval growth and energy requirements. A different approach, however, allows the utilization of the results obtained during the present study in production level. Using principles of the fuzzy set theory, a methodology was developed in order to control the evolution of the rearing and in particular the feeding requirements of the reared population. The objective of the development was the integration of a controller in already existing feeding-systems, which will <b>adapt</b> the <b>quantities</b> of food delivered daily according to the needs of the reared population. The control process was based on the identification of the current situation of the population and the implementation of such actions that would allow the optimization of its development. Analysis was performed through a "knowledge base" that included rules in the "if-then" form. The rule base was formed based on the results of the present study as well as on existing experience of the development of the rearing system. Theoretical inquiry into the controller's action showed that it simulates with high accuracy the changes of the larval feeding requirements. Application of the controller allows the partial automation of the rearing during larval stages.
