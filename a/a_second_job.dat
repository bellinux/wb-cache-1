5|$|Tied {{into the}} battle {{system is a}} Job system: {{beginning}} with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>Job</b> can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>job</b> and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} {{as a temporary}} clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>job,</b> working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his first-class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.|$|E

Several hypotheses are tested — the effect of individual and household income on secondary employment decisions, the dependence of first <b>job</b> parameters on <b>second</b> <b>job</b> characteristics, and the different motives of secondary employment (the heterogeneity of jobs, limitations of time spent on the first job, labor mobility). Our research results support the conclusion that there are two different types of secondary employment (one {{in the form of a}} permanent job and another in the form of additional earnings ("prirabotki")), and that secondary employment depends on wage arrears and to some extent on labor mobility. The analysis of secondary employment motives showed that the heterogeneity of job positions is the main reason individuals seek secondary employment in the form of <b>a</b> permanent <b>second</b> <b>job,</b> while time limits on the first job are the dominating reason for seeking additional earnings.

Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool's pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai.

40|$|With the {{longitudinal}} {{data from the}} SOEP this paper examines how 'marginal' part-time workers {{have responded to the}} liability to social security payments for such employment relationships, which was introduced in April 1999. As solely 'marginal' part-time workers and those with 'marginal' part-time <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> are affected by the new regulations in very different ways, separate empirical analyses are carried out. The dynamics of 'marginal' part-time employment and <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> are compared with a pseudo-contrafactual situation {{in order to be able}} to analyse the influences of the reform which go beyond the 'natural' changes. Furthermore, econometric methods are used to examine what determinants influence a worker's remaining in or leaving 'marginal' part-time employment or <b>a</b> 'marginal' part-time <b>second</b> <b>job.</b> The results show that a change has occurred in the structure of 'marginal' part-time employment: people with 'marginal' part-time <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> are tending to be substituted by workers whose sole job is 'marginal' part-time. The change in structure can be explained from both the supply-side and the demand-side. The aim of including income from 'marginal' part-time employment to finance the social insurance systems has certainly been approached. However, it remains doubtful whether the workers, and especially the married women, will build up any considerable entitlements of their own particularly in the statutory pension scheme. Their incentives for changing to part-time or full-time employment have been reduced even further by the reform.
