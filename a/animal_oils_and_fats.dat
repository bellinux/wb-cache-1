Manufacture of basic industrial chemicals including fertilizers, vegetable and <b>animal</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>fats,</b> paints, varnishes and lacquers and other miscellaneous chemical products is another important industry in the district. These industries are mainly concentrated in the Trans-Thane Creek and Belapur Road industrial area. The medium and large industries manufacturing chemicals and chemical products are Pfizer, Lubrizol India Ltd., Polyolefins Industries Ltd., NOCIL, Herdillia Chemicals Ltd., BASF (India) Ltd., Star Chemicals, INDOFIL INDUSTRIES LIMITED, and Phoenix Chemical Works. The chemical industries are also found {{in other parts of the}} district like Wagle Industrial Estate, Pokhran Road, Ambarnath and Dombivli. The cotton and non-cotton power looms are mainly located at Bhiwandi, Thane and Kalyan. Traditionally, Bhiwandi is famous for its handlooms. But the deteriorating markets for the handlooms compelled the weavers to replace their handlooms by powerlooms. Fisheries constitute an important industry in Thane district. It is carried out in sea as well as in creeks and estuaries on the western coast. Marine fishery predominates over inland fishery in the district and provides employment to about 75% of the persons engaged in the fishing industry. Fishing in sea is carried out along the coast stretching over about 110km. The important fishing centres in the district are Dahanu, Pokharan-Uchheli, Nawapur, Murabe, Satpute, Datiware, Arnala, Vasai and Uran. Food processing industries like grain mill products, Bakery products, Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery, Salt, ice, slaughtering, preparation and preservation of meat, dairy products, canning and preservation of fruits and vegetables, canning, preserving and processing of fish are developed in the district. Raptakos, Brett and Co., Pfizer Ltd., Cadbury Fry (India) Ltd. which produce modified milk food and high protein food are some of the large and medium companies in the district. Wood products like plywood and veneer, wooden boxes, barrels, bamboo, cane baskets, bobbins, industrial fixtures, cork & cork products are also manufactured in the district. The Tarapur Atomic Power Station which has ushered an era of utilisation of nuclear energy for electricity generation is also situated in the district. The finance is being provided by various public sector and private sector Banks and Financial Institutions in the district.

The relationship between dietary patterns, particularly {{the consumption of}} <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> age at menarche in a slum-dwelling adolescent population in India is examined. Methods: Data were derived from a cross-sectional baseline survey and anthropometric measurements among 10 - to 19 -year-old adolescents (n= 545, female respondents 272, of whom 160 were post-menarcheal) and a household survey in two slums {{in the city of}} Nashik, Western India. By using mixed effects linear regression models, the association between age at menarche and household-wise use of sources of <b>animal</b> protein <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> is examined. Results: Age at menarche (mean 13. 7 years) in the slums studied was relatively high according to Indian standards. Age at menarche and the consumption of dairy products, meat, fish and eggs were not associated. The household per capita consumption of vegetable oil had an inverse association with a girl’s age at menarche, and there was an indication of a positive association between use of ghee (clarified butter) and age at menarche. These associations did not disappear when controlling for anthropometric status and socio-economic characteristics. Conclusion: Intake of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> foods that are important sources of protein among underprivileged households in India is low and reflected in the relatively late age at menarche.

40|$|In {{a search}} for clues to {{previously}} unrecognised industrial carcinogens the occupational and smoking histories of young and middle aged men with different types of cancer have been compared. The study population comprised men aged 18 - 54 and resident in the counties of Cleveland, Humberside, and Cheshire (including the Wirral). Within this population 2942 patients in whom cancers were first diagnosed during the period 1975 - 80 were identified retrospectively from hospital and cancer registration records. Lifetime occupational and smoking histories were then sought from these subjects (or if they had died by proxy from their next of kin), using a postal questionnaire. The overall response rate was 52. 1 %. Analysis of limited occupational data obtained from the hospital notes of 89 % of the patients suggests that no serious bias arose from the incomplete response to the questionnaire. The present paper describes the findings for non-respiratory cancers. Some tumours did not occur with sufficient frequency to warrant formal statistical analysis. Nevertheless, examination of the histories of patients with these cancers showed several interesting occupational clusters. In particular, five out of 29 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia had worked in electrical trades. The more common cancers were studied by statistical techniques. A large number of possible occupational associations were examined, and some will probably have achieved conventional levels of statistical significance by chance. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution, taking into account evidence from other studies and the biological plausibility of suggested hazards.

30|$|There is a rapid {{decline in}} {{petroleum}} diesel reserve {{in recent years}} due to high demand of this energy source. The usage of this energy source poses serious environmental problems to the society. These challenges have stimulated the search for renewable fuels such as biodiesel, etc. Biodiesel is the most promising alternative diesel fuel which has attracted attention worldwide [11]. It is environmentally friendly because it is produced from natural resources such as vegetable <b>oils,</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> waste <b>oils</b> through {{a process known as}} transesterification to produce glycerol and fatty acid alkyl esters [8, 10, 32, 33, 35]. In addition to its environmental benign, biodiesel production is cheaper than production of petroleum-based diesel because the cost of its raw materials is cheap and typically accounts for about 70 – 80 % of the total cost of the production. This has stimulated research for production of biodiesel from non-edible resources using cheap and natural catalysts [13, 14, 21].|$|R
30|$|Biodiesel, either {{alone or}} in blends with fossil fuel, will help meet the world energy demands {{hitherto}} not yet sufficient. In addition, it is a renewable energy source which is unlike fossil fuels that is finite. Biodiesel obtained from energy crops also produces favorable effects on the environment, such as a decrease in acid rain and greenhouse effect caused by combustion [2]. Due to these factors and to its biodegradability, the production of biodiesel is considered an advantage than to that of fossil fuels [2]. Biodiesel is also nontoxic, eco-friendly, and useful in CO 2 recycling over short periods [3, 4]. Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)) derived {{from a variety of}} vegetable <b>oils,</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> <b>and</b> waste <b>oils</b> may eventually be applicable as a petro-diesel and chemical substitute. Also, biodiesel evidences many salient properties, most notably cetane number, flash point, and volumetric heating value which have also been shown to be comparable to those of petro-diesel [5, 6, 7, 8].|$|R

One of the major technical issues regarding the biodiesel blends with diesel fuel is the oxidation stability of the final blend, which is, nowadays, of particularly high concern due {{to the introduction of}} ultra low sulphur diesel, {{in most parts of the}} EU. This study examined the factors influencing the stability of several biodiesel blends with low and ultra low sulphur automotive diesel fuels. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of biodiesel source material and biodiesel concentration in diesel fuel, on the stability of the final blend. Moreover, the effects of certain characteristics of the base diesels, such as sulphur content and the presence of cracked stocks, on the oxidation stability are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
