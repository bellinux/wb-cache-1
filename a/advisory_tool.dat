Scenarios were investigated with and without <b>advisory</b> <b>tools</b> and improved displays, and also examined how well controllers could cope with off-nominal situations such as ties at merge points. The role of an arrival management planner responsible for issuing path changes to aircraft upon entry to the terminal area was also investigated. The results show that in the tools condition, controllers kept aircraft on their routes while maintaining similar throughput levels to the no-tools condition. Route deviations occurred in the no-tools condition. While the absence of advanced tools resulted in slightly higher workload, the average controller workload ratings were low for both the no-tools and tools conditions.

The TRACON controller decision support tools were found to provide the most benefit, by improving the precision in schedule conformance to within 20 seconds, reducing the number of arrivals having lateral path deviations by 50 % and lowering subjective controller workload.

40|$|Considering {{the current}} {{increasing}} of herd size, {{there is a}} need for precise and rapid information on individual cow state. Mid infrared (MIR) technology is already used worldwide for milk analysis; it allows rapid and cost effective determination of milk composition. The objective of OptiMIR project was to optimize the use of MIR spectra in order to produce indications on cow status thereby providing <b>advisory</b> <b>tools</b> to dairy farmers. Hence phenotypes of interest were collected in several countries and linked to MIR spectra. Since the OptiMIR network comprised 65 MIR instruments in 6 countries, standardisation of MIR data was necessary, allowing the collation of spectral databases and the use by all milk recording organizations (MRO) of the models developed. Using chemometric tools (like PLS regression), predictive models were developed to provide indicators on fine milk composition, on milk biomarkers of physiological imbalance, and directly on status of the cows. Equations predicting fine milk composition such as fatty acids and minerals were consolidated through the OptiMIR network, providing indirectly information on technological properties of milk and cow status. As biomarker of early physiological imbalance, an equation predicting citrate in milk was developed with good accuracy (R²cv= 0. 86); and as milk biomarkers of ketosis, BHB and acetone were calibrated with fair results (R²cv= 0. 63 and 0. 67 respectively). Direct classification of spectra regarding low vs high risk of ketosis was also performed (84. 5 % sensitivity and 84. 2 % specificity). Direct regressions were realized for various negative energy balance criteria (r from 0. 43 to 0. 57) and enteric methane (R²cv= 0. 7).

The main objective of the European project OptiMIR (INTERREG IVB North West Europe Program) is to develop innovative <b>advisory</b> <b>tools</b> based on the MIR data collected by milk recording organization. One of the first objectives is to develop a tool to assess the pregnancy status of cows. The tool is based on the comparison of the observed spectrum with an expected spectrum obtained from a set of spectra with a known status of the cow, here being open. Development was done using Walloon milk recording data. A training dataset (342, 832 spectral data from 66, 174 cows) was used to obtain residual spectra (i. e. difference between observed and expected spectra). Based {{on the fact that the}} pregnancy status of all cows was known, predictive discriminant function was constructed on 2, 154 residual spectra randomly selected from the initial dataset. The discriminant function was then applied on the rest of the dataset (12, 160 residual spectra) for validation.

These results showed a high potential for using directly the MIR spectrum of milk to detect a change in the pregnancy status of dairy cows. This methodology can also be applied to predict other types of physiological status changes (e. g. udder health related) and can be used on other types of biomarker data (i. e. collected from on-farm sensors).
