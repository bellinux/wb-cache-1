5|$|Beginning in fall 2007 {{there will}} be more than 30 traffic cameras {{operating}} on Omaha area freeways, including one at I-80 near Gretna and another on West Dodge near 120th Street. Operated by the Nebraska Department of Roads, the sensors and cameras <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> catch speeders or for other traffic enforcement. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes the cameras to monitor Omaha traffic patterns. Similar to traffic monitoring centers in Lincoln and North Platte, the one in Omaha is the biggest and has the greatest capability to provide traffic information.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} the human genome is {{commonly}} divided into coding and noncoding DNA sequences. Coding DNA is defined as those sequences that can be transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins during the human life cycle; these sequences occupy {{only a small fraction of}} the genome (<2%). Noncoding DNA is made up of all of those sequences (ca. 98% of the genome) that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> encode proteins.|$|E
25|$|Microfinance {{has been}} criticized in the foreign media. The Guardian (UK) asked whether {{microfinance}} was a 'neoliberal fairytale'. The article pointed out criticisms including that most loans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> create small businesses, but instead 'consumption smoothing'. Muhammad Yunus is widely {{perceived to be the}} founder of microcredit, though similar schemes had been operating for centuries. His idea of forming self-help groups among women borrowers was preceded by schemes set up by Khushi Kabir at BRAC.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} {{process for the}} ACL is usually broken down into different phases of rehabilitation. Each phase has its own objectives, however is intertwined with other phases since the goals are as progressive as the recovery itself. The rehabilitation process is at {{the pace of the}} patient. Timelines are sometimes given to help give an idea of where one can be during rehabilitation. Timeline <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> discourage or encourage those who aren’t ready to advance their {{recovery process}}. Such acts may cause serious injury or re-injury of the ACL.|$|E

25|$|Artecoll. Both Artecoll and ArteFill <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> inject {{the body}} of the lips because the {{substance}} is heavy and would show as white through the thin skin of the lips. Additionally, both products contain tiny microspheres known as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) which remain in the face permanently. In cases where Artecoll has been used {{around the edges of the}} lips to remove fine lines and wrinkles, some patients have reported annoying nodules or small lumps. In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.|$|E
25|$|QAPF {{diagrams}} {{are mostly}} used to classify plutonic rocks (phaneritic rocks), {{but are also}} used to classify volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical compositions have been determined. QAPF diagrams <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> classify pyroclastic rocks or volcanic rocks if modal mineralogical composition is not determined, instead the TAS classification (Total-Alkali-Silica) is used. TAS is also used if volcanic rock contains volcanic glass (such as obsidian). QAPF diagrams are also not used if mafic minerals {{make up more than}} 90% of the rock composition (for example: peridotites and pyroxenites).|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dual {{controls}} are conventional for a helicopter and {{consist of a}} single hydraulic system boosting the cyclic stick, collective lever and anti-torque pedals. The collective levers have integral throttles, although these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> control rotor rpm, which is automatically governed, but are used for starting and shutting down the engine. The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through torque tube linkages to the swash plate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement. Some UH-1Hs have been modified to replace the tail rotor control cables with torque tubes similar to the UH-1N Twin Huey.|$|E

25|$|As a rule, {{international}} association football {{has only}} had championship playoffs when a league {{is divided into}} several equal divisions/conferences/groups (Major League Soccer) and/or when the season is split into two periods (as in many leagues in Latin America, such as Mexico's Liga MX). In leagues with a single table done only once a year, as in most of Europe, playoff systems <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine champions, although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues (e.g., England) or qualifiers for European club competitions (such as Greece and the Netherlands), usually between teams that didn't perform well enough to earn an automatic spot.|$|E
25|$|Survival International {{has called}} {{attention}} to the rise in suicide in tribal peoples such as the Innu, Australian Aborigines and the Guarani, as a consequence of outside interference with the tribes' cultures and direct persecution. Suffering from the trauma of forced relocation, many tribal people find themselves in despair living in an environment they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> where there is nothing useful to do, and where they are treated with racist disdain by their new neighbours. Other social consequences from this displacement have been pointed out to alcoholism and violence, with campaigns reporting the cases of the Innu, Mursi, Bodi, Konso and Wanniyala-Aetto. Tribal peoples are also more vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Among the tribes with whom Survival International has campaigned, there has been reported rapes of girls and women by workers of invading companies in the indigenous tribes of Penan, West Papuan tribes, Jummas and Jarawa.|$|E
500|$|Babbling is an {{important}} aspect of vocabulary development in infants, since it appears to help practice producing speech sounds. Babbling begins between five and seven months of age. At this stage, babies start to play with sounds that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> express their emotional or physical states, such as sounds of consonants and vowels. Babies begin to babble in real syllables such as [...] "ba-ba-ba, neh-neh-neh, and dee-dee-dee," [...] between the ages of seven and eight months; this is known as canonical babbling. Jargon babbling includes strings of such sounds; this type of babbling uses intonation but doesn't convey meaning. The phonemes and syllabic patterns produced by infants begin to be distinctive to particular languages during this period (e.g., increased nasal sounds in French and Japanese babies) though most of their sounds are similar. There is a shift from babbling to the use of words as the infant grows.|$|E

500|$|Vikram allotted 18 {{months and}} 190 {{days of his}} call sheet for the film, {{including}} 165 days of bulk dates spread across six months. Speaking {{on the extent of}} his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, [...] "Before beginning the film, I was totally involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says." [...] He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the [...] "ultimate verdict" [...] to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to be the toughest, he reasoned, [...] "Because as a hero you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> being a wimp on screen. It's difficult digesting getting beaten up." [...] In contrast, being a graduate in English literature, he found playing Remo much easier and more in his comfort zone.|$|E
