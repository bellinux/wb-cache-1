50|$|For the SNCF, {{this type}} of machine {{constituted}} a small revolution - with simple expansion and very advanced construction techniques, the 141 R 1101-1340 were the only SNCF steam locomotives equipped with Boxpok wheels, and roller bearings on all the driving and coupled axles, {{as well as an}} almost indeformable one-piece cast steel frame. The bar frames and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearings</b> of 141 R 1-1100, appeared irreproachable, which made them powerful machines but economical to maintain. For 141 R 1101-1340, the maximum mileage run between two main works visits was up to 230000 km. Easy to drive, they offered relatively modern comfort for both drivers and firemen. The cabs were fully enclosed, equipped with a comfort and an ergonomic hitherto unknown to SNCF crews. Driving and firing controls were within reach while seated, with automatic coal feeding thanks to the mechanical stoker, and oil-firing was even easier. They were banalisées ("standardised"), that is, not assigned to a particular crew.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Online fault {{diagnosis}} {{for the train}} <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearings</b> is a wide and important study topic since it plays {{a critical role in}} train safety. Due to the vibration signals ’ nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics, accuracies of the methods such as neural network and hierarchical clustering are less than 90 % which are not satisfying. In this paper, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), a nonlinear process technique, was to tackle each signal’s 18 feature parameters for extracting the main features to reflect the signal characteristics. Then, in fault pattern recognition, support vector machine (SVM) based on genetic algorithm (GA) was used to identify the current fault type of the bearings, including normal, outer ring fault, inner ring fault and rolling element fault. The results show that the prediction accuracy of GA-SVM method reaches to 96. 33 %, which is quite effective...|$|E
40|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{the most}} {{critical}} mechanical components of railway vehicles. Condition monitoring is of great benefit to ensure the healthy status of bearings in the railway train. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis model for axle box bearing based on symmetric alpha-stable distribution feature extraction and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) using vibration signals is proposed which is conducted in three main steps. Firstly, fast nonlocal means is used for denoising and ensemble empirical mode decomposition is applied to extract fault feature information. Then a new statistical method of feature extraction, symmetric alpha-stable distribution, is employed to obtain representative features from intrinsic mode functions. Additionally, the hybrid fault feature sets are input into LS-SVM to identify the fault type. To enhance the performance of LS-SVM {{in the case of}} small-scale samples, Morlet wavelet kernel function is combined with LS-SVM for the classification of fault type and fault severity and the particle swarm optimization is used for the optimization of LS-WSVM parameters. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs more effectively and robustly than the other methods in small-scale samples for fault detection and classification of railway vehicle bearings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this study, we {{verified}} {{the applicability}} of the energy harvesting technology to the railroad system for real-time wireless sensor networks. The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic thermo element of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing.</b> Theoretically, the energy harvesting power of 63. 8 mW can be obtained and thus by using the energy harvesting power {{it will be possible to}} operate the wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Failure of {{the train}} <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> will cause great loss. Now, {{condition-based}} maintenance of train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> has been a research hotspot around the world. Vibration signals generated by train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> have nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. The methods used in traditional bearing fault diagnosis do not work well with the train <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> To solve this problem, an effective method of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis based on multifeature parameters is presented in this paper. This method {{can be divided into}} three parts, namely, weak fault signal extraction, feature extraction, and fault recognition. In the first part, a db 4 wavelet is employed for denoising the original signals from the vibration sensors. In the second part, five time-domain parameters, five IMF energy-torque features, and two amplitude-ratio features are extracted. The latter seven frequency domain features are calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition and envelope spectrum analysis. In the third part, a fault classifier based on BP neural network is designed for automatic fault pattern recognition. A series of tests are carried out to verify the proposed method, which show that the accuracy is above 90 %...|$|R

There it stood outside until 1995, when it was moved to Eastleigh College to undergo restoration. Townsend Hook was {{dismantled}} and work undertaken on the frames, and new <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> were cast. Unfortunately, due to a change in curriculum at the college work on Townsend Hook was abandoned and it was eventually returned to Amberley where it was stored in a partially dismantled condition until 2010 when work on a cosmetic overhaul was started in earnest. A return to steam is unlikely for the foreseeable future, due to the limited use the loco would receive, and also that many items such as the boiler and water tanks would need to be replaced.|$|R
40|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> {{temperature}} heating {{detection system}} {{was developed for}} early detection of abnormal heating of components of axle bearings—important running devices for railway rolling stock— so that critical accidents could be prevented. 1) 2) 3) The developed system is now being deployed for major lines in the greater Tokyo area. Early detection of abnormality of bearings is needed in regions with heavy snowfall too, so we examined functions for cold and snow resistance to apply the system for the greater Tokyo area to cold regions. We installed a prototype system that reflected the examination results at Ugo-Ushijima Station on the Uetsu Line (in Akita City) in the period from December 2010 to September 2011. Using that, we investigated the effects low temperature, snow cover, and snowfall have on performance. Development for System for Cold Regions 2 The developed system measures temperature of components of an <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> that holds <b>bearings.</b> Specifically, it is a system using contactless infrared temperature sensors (infrared radiation thermometers) installed facing <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of running train cars as shown in Fig. 1. The system measures surface temperature of <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> obliquely from below, and it gives an alert if it detects that a designated temperature is exceeded. Wheel detectors that are installed on the rail determine the position of each <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> By using three wheel detectors on each side, velocity of passing trains is calculated to identify {{the position of the}} axles. The system has a built-in heater to keep ambient temperature at 5 ºC or higher for stable operation of temperature sensors. As the sensors are an infrared type, there should be no obstacles between the system and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> to be measured. Furthermore, to apply the current system to cold regions, cold and snow resistance has to be enhanced. Taking into account those conditions and installation to lines along the coast of the Japan Sea (Uetsu Line and Ou Line), we set the following specification values for cold regions based on weather data in the previous five years at Niitsu, Akita, Odate and Hirosaki...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide). <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The end portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> housing increased. The reason was the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> spring seating. They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} spring seating due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves down. The downward movement of the <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R
40|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>boxes</b> (Fig. 1) {{support the}} weight of the car while {{rotating}} the axles. On occasion, problems such as foreign substances in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> cause abnormal heating, and may be a cause of critical accidents such as derailment. We currently check abnormal heating of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> by visual inspection using thermo-labels (Fig. 2) attached {{to the end of the}} axle that change color when temperature rises. But, with the current method, we can check such heating only after the train enters locations such as the vehicle maintenance depot. We thus studied the possibility of more frequent temperature checking system for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> heating while the train is running to reduce the risk of critical accidents. We thus started developing a system which detects the running <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> heating from the wayside precisely by using temperature sensors.

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the <b>axle.</b> The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> grease is filled in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. Each <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is placed on a housing which closes the <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil.

40|$|Rail welds {{are widely}} used in {{high-speed}} railways and short-wave irregularities usually appear due to limitations in welding technology. These irregularities can excite a high wheel/rail force and are regarded as {{the main cause of}} deterioration in track structures. To measure this fierce force (or deterioration of the rail weld), <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration is treated as an effective and economic measure, though an exact quantitative relation between these two quantities remains elusive. This paper aims to develop such a relation in order to provide a new theoretical basis and an analysis method for monitoring and controlling weld geometry irregularity. To better understand the characteristics of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, the paper consists of two parts: an observation and a numerical simulation of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration by rail welds. Based on measured data from field tests, <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration at rail welds was found to have high-frequency vibrations in two frequency bands (i. e., 350 – 500 Hz and 1000 – 1200 Hz). Upon analyzing the vibration characteristics in time–frequency domains, the exact location of the rail weld irregularity could be identified. Subsequently, a 3 D high-speed wheel/rail rolling contact finite element model was employed to investigate the effect of rail weld geometry on <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, and led to the discovery that the weld length and depth determine the vibration frequency and amplitude of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, respectively. A quantitative relation between <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration and wheel/rail force has also been determined. Finally, we propose an approach for real-time health detection of rail welds and discuss the influence of other defects and rail welds on the acceleration signal of the <b>axle</b> <b>box...</b>|$|R
