5000|$|According to Weber, a {{political}} regime is legitimate when the citizens {{have faith in}} that system. In his book, The Theory of Social and Economic Organization, Weber expands upon this idea when he writes “the basis of every system of authority, and correspondingly of every kind of willingness to obey, is a belief, a belief by virtue of which persons exercising authority are lent prestige." [...] Weber provides three main sources of legitimate rule: traditional (it has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way),</b> rational-legal (trust in legality), and charismatic (faith in the ruler). However, as Weber explains in his book Economy and Society, these ideal forms of legitimacy will necessarily always overlap. The example that Weber gives is with that of legal authority. Legality is partly traditional, for it is [...] "established and habitual." [...] He argues that due {{to the presence of}} legitimate authority and the way legitimate authority structures society, citizens who do not share in the belief of this legitimacy still face incentives to act as if they did.|$|E
50|$|The BC Interior is {{a fairly}} {{conservative}} area today, although it has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> From {{the early days of}} the party to the early 1990s, this region was a New Democratic Party stronghold until its support throughout the entire province collapsed in 1993. From 1993 to 2000, the Reform and Canadian Alliance parties took over in a dramatic shift (widely seen as a protest vote against established parties), winning handily in nearly every riding. The Conservatives continued to hold most of the seats in 2004 (with one exception in the northwestern corner of the province). While the NDP managed to take another seat in 2006, staunch divisions on social issues made it difficult for the NDP to make further gains. Some of the strongest conservative support is in Kelowna and the Okanagan, where a large number of retirees reside. For decades, the only close races in this region have been between the Conservatives and NDP. In the 2015 election, regional NDP strength allowed them to pick up a third seat, and in one of the biggest surprises of the election, the Liberals picked up their first seat in the BC Interior since 1974 in the region's most urban riding, Kelowna—Lake Country.|$|E

40|$|The {{image of}} the French in the {{cultural}} imagination is one of elegance and class, a people possessing a certain je ne sais quoi that sets them apart in their sense of style and sophistication. This idea of the French is so inherent to their image that {{it seems like it}} has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> In my thesis I ask the question of how good taste became an integral part of French national identity. I argue that good taste became part of the French identity during the French Revolution, as changing attitudes towards consumer culture and gender that occurred over the later half of the eighteenth century took on specifically nationalist characteristics in light of the Revolution. Over the course of the eighteenth century, French society transformed from a "moral economy," in which dress signified social status, to a consumer economy, in which the middle and lower classes had access to fashion. This sartorial confusion broke down the traditional Ancien Regime visual hierarchy. As fashion ceased to signify social status, it became, instead, an indice of gender. Inspired by Rousseau's model of domestic femininity, the luxury industry promoted fashion as a way for women to please men and fulfill feminine goals such as finding a husband. As fashionable consumption became a "natural" desire for women, it was rejected as equally "unnatural" for men. In order to adapt to the changes in consumption wrought by the burgeoning consumer revolution, luxury industries adopted a new vocabulary of consumption. In {{the first half of the}} eighteenth century, luxury lost its sinful connotations and became a source of national prosperity. Moralists awkwardly tried to categorize different kinds of luxury with terms such as "useful" or "harmful" luxury. The concept of "taste" developed as an inclusive, egalitarian criterion for consumption that was well-suited to the rapidly expanding market. Taste acquired positive connotations of commerce, while the vocabulary of luxury was linked to the corruption of the Ancien Regime. In the world of fashion, "good taste" was associated with simplicity and naturalism. Taste and luxury thus acquired moral connotations that became politicized during the Revolution. Good taste was linked to republican virtue, while luxury represented aristocratic corruption. During the Revolution, the moral judgments applied to luxury and taste solidified the boundary between men and women and relegated them to their respective places in the new political order. While the transformation from subject to citizen occurred easily for men, who renounced luxurious dress for republican sobriety, the role of women in the Revolution remained ambiguous. The fashion industry held up the stereotype of the female aristocrat [...] luxuriously dressed, sexually voracious, and meddling in politics [...] as the epitome of bad taste. Its definition of good taste emphasized modesty and feminine self-restriction. Nevertheless, it did not fully subscribe to the domestic ideal of the republican wife and mother. The fashion industry resolved this ambiguity by endowing women with symbolic power. As women found themselves excluded from the political sphere, the fashion industry repositioned them as nationalist symbols whose fashionable good taste projected the glory of the French Republic across Europe. As women had been disassociated from the political sphere, the myth of La Francaise long outlasted the French Revolution. It endures up to the present day in our {{image of the}} elegant French woman dressed with impeccable good taste...|$|E
