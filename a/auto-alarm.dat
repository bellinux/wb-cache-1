At present, the {{automatic}} fire alarm systems on sale were produced by different factories, {{which resulted in the}} information not being shared mutually. Furthermore, it was difficult to connect the different fire <b>auto-alarm</b> systems to the same network. They couldn't communicate automatically with the city fire-fight commanding center in time. We designed interface module of {{automatic fire alarm}} controller network and interface module of data center network. By using the existing net of PSTN and internet, it could transmit the breakdown information and a fire information of the automatic fire alarm systems to the fire-fight commanding center, the long-range diagnose, the real-time monitor of a fire and the long-range control in the city fire <b>auto-alarm</b> system was realized...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first home}} of the AMVER Center was at the New York Custom House in {{downtown}} New York City, {{due to the fact}} that many commercial cargo and passenger lines operating in the Atlantic maintained offices nearby, and AMVER's success would depend on close ties to the merchant fleet. The system's first computer was an IBM RAMAC (Random Access Method Accounting Control), characterized as being able to [...] "evaluate information and determine the position of vessels through dead reckoning." [...] The product of the computer was a [...] "Surface Picture" [...] or [...] "SURPIC" [...] of an area of the ocean, indicating the AMVER participating ships in the vicinity. In 1966, the Coast Guard moved its regional headquarters from the Custom House to Governors Island, in upper New York Bay. The move included the AMVER Center and consolidated all New York area Coast Guard activities, including a Rescue Coordination Center, at one site. One year after the move, AMVER's title was revised to read Automated Merchant VEssel Reporting program. Subsequent homes for the AMVER computer would include Washington, D.C; Governors Island, New York; and now at Martinsburg, West Virginia.In October 1982, the first joint AMVER/satellite-alerting rescue occurred, using the experimental ARGOS and Cospas-Sarsat system. December of that year saw the U.S. Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard sign an agreement making AMVER participation mandatory for U.S.-flag shipping, and suspending the requirement for the filing of reports to the overlapping USMER reporting system. This benefited many U.S. masters, already AMVER participants, who were juggling reports to two parallel systems, and allowed for a consolidated plot of all U.S. shipping worldwide.With the advent of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS), the role of AMVER was redefined to complement the emerging technology. Rescue coordination centers around the world began using Electronic Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBS), Inmarsat-C and Digital Selective Calling terminal <b>auto-alarms</b> to [...] "take the search out of search and rescue." [...] Then, attention could be turned to AMVER as a tool for the rescue phase of the operation.The beginning of the 1990s saw the need for the entire software package of AMVER to be rewritten in UNIX/Windows technology to keep pace with the evolution of data processing. This new version would provide more capacity; mechanisms for recurrent routings and maintaining ships on station (e.g., research ships or fishing factory ships); graphic plot depiction; and parser capability, once again bringing AMVER current with the state-of-the-art. Home for the AMVER Center was moved to the Operations Systems Center, a new facility designed and built to consolidate many Coast Guard computer systems at Martinsburg, West Virginia. Contracted out to civilian operation, this facility released many staff members for reassignment throughout the Coast Guard.In conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and COMSAT (the U.S. signatory to Inmarsat) AMVER has assisted in the development of [...] "compressed message" [...] software to move report data at high speed and low cost to encourage more frequent, user-friendly reporting and thus increase plot accuracy at a time when many shipping companies are removing full-time radio officers from GMDSS-compliant ships.Today, over 22,000 ships from hundreds of nations participate in AMVER. An average of 4,000 ships are on the AMVER plot each day and those numbers continue to increase. The AMVER Center computer receives over 14,000 AMVER messages a day. Over 2,800 lives have been saved by AMVER participating ships since 2000.|$|R
