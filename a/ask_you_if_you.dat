While Conteh looked embarrassed, Cook chipped in with an {{observation}} for the host: [...] "I wouldn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have sex before a show. I can see that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the urging}} of his friends, Patel won an {{election}} to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. While often clashing with British officials on civic issues, he did not show any interest in politics. Upon hearing of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, he joked to the lawyer and political activist, Ganesh Vasudev Mavlankar, that [...] "Gandhi would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know how to shift pebbles from wheat. And {{that is supposed to}} bring independence." [...] A subsequent meeting with Gandhi, in October 1917 brought a radical change in Patel and ushered him into the Indian independence struggle.|$|E
2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Meli√°n Lafinur.|$|E

6000|$|... "When I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were alone}} you {{pretended to be}} angry," [...] she remembered with a flash. [...] "You said, 'Do I tell lies?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just thought}} I'd <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had heard {{anything}} about that Blackie Crowden yet," [...] remarked the gardener from Hope, as he approached.|$|E
60|$|Of course I regard {{your time}} as valuable, and {{consider}} it so when I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could devote {{any of it}} to this purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "One would {{certainly}} fancy {{that you had}} quite enough already--but I wonder if one might <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have heard from Reggie lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's why I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{had been}} painted,--so {{as to make}} some little {{distinction}} between the two. I am a painter by profession, and do portraits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> couldn't. But you can't. It's too dreadful for me, as so near a relation, to have, loyally--loyally to YOU--to say it. But he's impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, my dear man, {{let your}} Preface show, the lovely, friendly, irresistible {{log-rolling}} Preface that I've been <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't be an angel and write for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{call this}} FAIR to the boy, Mr. Twing?" [...] said Mrs. Martin hotly; [...] "but {{is this your}} idea of discipline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't condescend {{to answer}} your unjust nonsense, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Hilary. [...] "I will merely <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish to marry Mr. Maxwell--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will come up to lunch, Jim, but I suppose {{you will not be}} able to tear {{yourself}} away from here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A mere nothing. I had a headache--gone now--and was {{not quite}} fit for a hot theatre, so I stayed at home. I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were not well, because you look so white.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the history}} of his wise speeches {{occupied}} them for some time, with other matters, until just as their drive was nearly concluded, Selina exclaimed, [...] "But all this time I have never <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can throw any light on this extraordinary step of Edmund Arundel's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will away, {{straight}} for your father's trading-post." [...] Jean Bevoir paused a moment. [...] "It may be I can persuade Pontiac to give <b>you</b> up. <b>If</b> I can, {{so much the}} better. But if not, remember what I have told <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> Pontiac <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will go with me, say yes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{can suggest}} any {{plan that will}} not fail. You are very cunning in your way, and your advice may be good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> liked him," [...] he {{explained}} to her. [...] "I asked you if he was brainy. I'm not too sure that you like brainy men." ...|$|E
60|$|Dr Oakes {{was a big}} {{man with}} a breezy manner, the sort of doctor who hits you with the force of a {{sledge-hammer}} in the small ribs, and <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> felt anything then. It was on this principle that he acted with regard to Barry's ankle. He seized it in both hands and gave it a wrench.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago you spoke of your indignation at the inequalities and injustices of the world, and when I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had always felt this, you replied that this feeling had grown upon you. My {{question}} is this: whether that indignation would be present at all {{if it were not}} meant to be turned into action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the last}} word I heard from you," [...] said I; [...] "you shouted it to me when your vessel was going away for the last time. It has caused me a world of misery.

6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would {{be good enough to}} do so, Sir Ralph," [...] Edgar said. [...] "My father has {{furnished}} me with money for the purpose." ...|$|E
50|$|Similar to the iPod's click wheel, the Pocket DJ {{has a small}} scroll barrel {{that can}} be used to scroll through playlists, etc. When you scroll to a song, you push down on the barrel and a menu comes up <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to play the song, add it to a playlist, delete it, etc. You can bypass the pop-up menu by pushing the Play/Pause button.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the game}} is played in the Galaxy view where you can manage your {{different}} systems. When two enemy fleets meet, the game <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish to switch to the tactical interface, which allows you to control your fleet in a real-time space battle. It suffers from poor graphics, but the fan community now offers a large array of ships {{that can be used to}} replace the original ones.|$|R
6000|$|But Major Hynd {{was not to}} be {{discouraged}} by sharp replies. [...] "Miss Eyrecourt and I have been recalling our first meeting on board the steamboat," [...] he went on. [...] "Do you remember how indifferent you were to that beautiful person when I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> knew her? I'm glad to see that you show better taste to-night.

6000|$|... "Oh, Adair," [...] he said. [...] "No, don't get up. I merely {{wished to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> found any paint on your boots when you {{returned}} to the house last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Lucy, [...] "I {{wanted to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were willing to}} let me stay here to-day and play with Rollo, {{if you do not}} go to the mountain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! And {{the only}} nice lovable crank I've found--except you, with your vulgar {{prejudice}} against the whole race of authors--is a dark-eyed female {{who sits on}} a couch out in the big room, like a Mrs. St. Simeon Stylites in a tight skirt, and drags you in by her glittering eye, looking {{as though she was}} going to speak about theosophy, and then <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think a highball would help her cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You go hence to-morrow, prince,' {{she said}} softly, 'and I have a favour to <b>ask</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will listen to}} your handmaid.' ...|$|R
