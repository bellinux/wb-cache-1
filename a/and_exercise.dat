5|$|After {{suffering}} {{chest pains}} while filming The Drew Carey Show in August 2001, Carey {{went to the}} hospital, where he underwent a coronary angioplasty. Although his weight was a comedic topic throughout his sitcom and improv shows, in 2010 he began a diet <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> plan, resulting in an extensive weight loss (similar to former TPIR announcer Rod Roddy). He also claimed that he cured his Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs between {{current and}} future {{consequences}} are characteristic for the domain of health behavior. Therefore, both eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior could be determined by time orientation, which refers to an individual’s general orientation toward the present or the future. The main aim of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} relations between time orientation and both eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. The results of this dissertation confirm that time orientation is a shared determinant of eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Nevertheless, time orientation for food <b>and</b> for <b>exercise</b> are different constructs that, in turn, have differential relations with eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Specifically, eating behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of immediate consequences, whereas exercising behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of future consequences. In addition, these relations can be partly explained by construal level. Theoretically, the results of this dissertation contribute in various ways {{to a better understanding of}} the construct of time orientation and its relations with eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Methodologically, the results of this dissertation have several implications for the measurement of time orientation as well as the measurement of eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Practically, the results of this dissertation can be used in the development of campaigns to stimulate healthy eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Overall, the insights that have been gained in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of individuals’ intertemporal decision making in the health domain and can ultimately be used in order to promote and stimulate healthy eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior...|$|R

40|$|Eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> {{behaviour}} {{are both}} characterized by immediate and future consequences. Consequently, consideration of these consequences (i. e. time orientation) predicts eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour. We investigate whether construal level {{acts as an}} underlying mechanism of these relations. Students (N= 101) completed measures of consideration of immediate and future consequences (i. e. CFC-food and CFC-exercise), construal level, eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour <b>and</b> preferences. For self-reported eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour, only direct effects of consideration of immediate and future consequences were found. For eating preferences, however, there was evidence of an indirect effect through construal level. A stronger tendency to consider future consequences led to a stronger preference for utilitarian (as compared with hedonic) food products through a more abstract construal level. All in all, construal level partially explains the differential relations between consideration of immediate and future consequences <b>and</b> eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour <b>and</b> preferences. </p...|$|R

5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty.

The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> to surgical intervention.|$|E
