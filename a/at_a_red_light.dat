25|$|In January 2015, bus 617 and bus 747 were {{involved}} in separate accidents, resulting in the complete write-off of 747. 617 was repaired at the Yale Transit Yard, and returned to active service in early 2016. Nobody was seriously harmed in either accident, and both accidents were caused by other vehicles failing to stop <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|Through most of Canada, {{a driver}} may turn right <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> after {{coming to a}} {{complete}} stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre {{did not result in}} significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to turn right on a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists are reminded of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.|$|E
25|$|At 6:43 pm, {{truck driver}} Larry Tarvin, driving down Florence, stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> at Normandie {{in a large}} white {{delivery}} truck. He was pulled from the truck {{by a group of}} men including Henry Watson, who proceeded to kick and beat him, before striking him unconscious with a fire extinguisher taken from his own vehicle. He lay unconscious for more than a minute as his truck was looted, before staggering back to his vehicle. With the help of an unknown African American named Rodney, Tarvin was able to drive his truck out of further harm's way. Just before he did so, another truck, driven by Reginald Denny, entered the intersection.|$|E

25|$|Nine {{months after}} the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, {{on the morning of}} March 10, 1989, Rogers' wife Sharon escaped uninjured when a pipe bomb {{exploded}} and set fire to her minivan as she sat stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> {{across the street from the}} University Towne Center shopping mall in San Diego. The van was registered in the name of Will Rogers III, and many people at the time of the bombing suspected that terrorism was involved. Five months later, the Associated Press reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had shifted focus away from terrorism towards the possibility of someone with a personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers. As of 2003, the bombing of Rogers' van remains an unsolved case, despite a major investigation involving at some time up to 300 police and FBI agents. On February 17, 1993, the case was featured on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries, but no additional information was uncovered.|$|E
25|$|At 11:0011:05p.m. (PDT), {{they were}} halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police {{for playing the}} car stereo too loudly and not having license plates, which {{were found in the}} trunk of Knight's car; the party was {{released}} a few minutes later without being ticketed. At 11:10p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.|$|E

The driver of the Impala, an African American male dressed in a blue suit and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a 9mm blue-steel pistol and fired at the GMC Suburban; four bullets hit Wallace in the chest. Wallace's entourage rushed him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but he was pronounced dead at 1:15 a.m. (PST) ...|$|E

Range described being semi-naked {{in front of the}} camera as [...] "weird, and very invasive". The video opens with a scene of Buena in a moving car down the streets in London, where she is sitting next to a man on the phone. She boils up the courage to leave her superstar boyfriend.

2500|$|During 1982–1992, {{approximately}} 84 fatal crashes {{per year}} {{occurred in the}} U.S. where a vehicle was turning right at intersections where right turn on red was permitted.

When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch then crashed into a fence.|$|E

[...] Migden claims that she may have suffered from an adverse response to her leukemia treatment that led her to drive erratically. 911 tapes released in August show other drivers who saw her during her 30-mile trip along I-80 were panicking as they reported seeing her hit the center divider, and repeatedly come close to hitting other cars, before finally hitting one. One motorist claimed Migden told her, [...] "You can't talk to me like that. I'm a senator." [...] Migden voluntarily ceased driving as she continued to undergo treatment and as medical tests were pursued. Migden claimed that her [...] "wild ride" [...] occurred during state business, so that the Department of General Services paid $335,000 to Butawan in July 2009.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{a person}} who fails to stop <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> traffic <b>light</b> while driving a vehicle and hits someone {{crossing}} the street could be found to intend or be reckless as to assault or criminal damage (see DPP v Newbury). There is no intent to kill, and a resulting death would not be considered murder, but would be considered involuntary manslaughter. The accused's responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing {{what might have been}} a minor criminal act. Reckless driving or reckless handling of a potentially lethal weapon may result in a death that is deemed manslaughter.|$|R
