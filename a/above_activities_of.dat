40|$|Translation {{initiation}} in {{extracts from}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the concerted {{action of the}} cap-binding protein eIF 4 E and the poly(A) tail-binding protein Pab 1 p. These two proteins bind to translation initiation factor eIF 4 G and are needed for the translation of capped or polyadenylated mRNA, respectively. Together, these proteins synergistically activate the translation of a capped and polyadenylated mRNA. We have discovered that excess Pab 1 p also stimulates the translation of capped mRNA in extracts, a phenomenon that we define as trans-activation. Each of the <b>above</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> Pab 1 p requires its second RNA recognition motif (RRM 2). We have found that RRM 2 from human PABP cannot substitute functionally for yeast RRM 2.

The phytochemical screenings were performed by using the standard procedures. The acetone and methanol extracts were active against the 10 bacteria strains with MIC ranging between 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/ml, whereas the water extract was only active against two Gram-negative bacterial strains at 10. 0 mg/ml.

The range of the TPC in grape stem extracts was from 345 to 584 mg GAE/g dry weight. Moreover, stem extracts contained different classes of polyphenols as flavonols, flavanols, procyanidins, phenolic acids and stilbenes. In DPPH and ABTS assays, the IC 50 values of the stem extracts had an average of 7. 8 +/- 2. 8 and 5. 4 +/- 2. 6 mu g/mL respectively. Also, all stem extracts inhibited OH center dot- and ROO center dot- induced DNA damage dose dependent with average IC 50 values of 478 +/- 217 and 1. 15 +/- 0. 85 mu g/mL respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Emergence of {{drug-resistant}} {{strains of}} Candida and inefficiency of conventional antifungal therapy has necessitated {{the search for}} alternative and new antifungal agents. Inhibition of virulence and biofilm are the potential drug targets. In this study, the oils of Carum copticum, Thymus vulgaris and their major active compound thymol as revealed by Gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-GC/MS) analysis were tested for their inhibitory activity against growth to determine sub-MIC values against 27 drug-resistant strains of Candida spp. METHODS: Brothmacrodilution method was used for determination of MIC of test oils against Candida strains. The spectrophotometric methods were used for detection and inhibition assays for virulence factors in Candida spp. Light and electron microscopy was performed to observe morphological effects of oils on biofilms. GC-GC/MS were {{used to evaluate the}} major active compounds of test oils. RESULTS: Virulence factors like proteinase and haemolysin were detected in 18 strains, both in solid and liquid media. A 70 % of the test strains exhibited hydrophobicity and formed moderate to strong biofilms (OD 280 0. 5 - > 1. 0). Test oils exhibited MICs in the range of 45 – 360 μg. mL− 1 against the majority of test strains. All the oils at 0. 25 × and 0. 5 × MICs induced > 70 % reduction in the cell surface hydrophobicity, proteinase and haemolysin production. At 0. 5 × MIC, thymol and T. vulgaris were most inhibitory against biofilm formation. At sub-MICs electron microscopic studies revealed the deformity of complex structures of biofilms formed and cell membranes appeared to be the target site of these agents. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our findings have highlighted the concentration dependent activity of oils of C. copticum and T. vulgaris against virulence factors and biofilms in proteinase and haemolysin producing drug-resistant strains of Candida spp. The <b>above</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> test oils are supposed to be mainly contributed due to their major active compound thymol.

40|$|Abstract HIV- 1 Vpr is a viral {{accessory}} {{protein that}} activates ATR through the induction of DNA replication stress. ATR activation results in cell cycle arrest in G 2 and induction of apoptosis. In the present study, we investigate {{the role of}} the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) in the <b>above</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> Vpr. We report that the general function of the UPS is required for Vpr to induce G 2 checkpoint activation, as incubation of Vpr-expressing cells with proteasome inhibitors abolishes this effect. We further investigated in detail the specific E 3 ubiquitin ligase subunits that Vpr manipulates. We found that Vpr binds to the DCAF 1 subunit of a cullin 4 a/DDB 1 E 3 ubiquitin ligase. The carboxy-terminal domain Vpr(R 80 A) mutant, which is able to bind DCAF 1, is inactive in checkpoint activation and has dominant-negative character. In contrast, the mutation Q 65 R, in the leucine-rich domain of Vpr that mediates DCAF 1 binding, results in an inactive Vpr devoid of dominant negative behavior. Thus, the interaction of Vpr with DCAF 1 is required, but not sufficient, for Vpr to cause G 2 arrest. We propose that Vpr recruits, through its carboxy terminal domain, an unknown cellular factor that is required for G 2 -to-M transition. Recruitment of this factor leads to its ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in failure to enter mitosis. </p...|$|R

Some of these forms {{could only be}} detected if the assay was performed at acidic pH (I and IV) or {{in the presence of}} deoxycholate (II). Gel-filtration chromatography indicated that the four forms had different molecular weights in the range 40000 - 120000. I, II and III all had pH optima in the range 4. 5 - 5. 5. However, the major form (III) also had substantial activity at pH 7. 0 and <b>above.</b> The <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> I, II and III at pH 7. 0 were stimulated by deoxycholate; this effect was most marked with I and II, which had very low activity at this pH. All forms of the enzyme were inhibited by EGTA and required 2 - 5 mM-CaCl 2 for maximal activity. When the fractions eluted from the ion-exchange and gel-filtration columns were assayed with polyphosphoinositides as substrates there was a close correspondence to the elution profile obtained with phosphatidylinositol as substrate; there was no evidence for the existence in heart <b>of</b> phospholipase C <b>activities</b> specific for individual phosphoinositides...|$|R
