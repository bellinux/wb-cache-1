5|$|Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry.

5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E

5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has <b>a</b> <b>veil.</b> S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} <b>a</b> <b>veil.</b> Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E

5|$|The {{placement}} of P.auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial. It {{has often been}} classified in the section Auricomi, a grouping of species characterized {{by the absence of}} <b>a</b> <b>veil,</b> and the occasional presence of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface), or dark setae-like elements. Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade, but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling. A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola, P.auricoma and P.conopilus form a tritomy with the crown Parasola species.|$|E
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> of white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of <b>a</b> <b>veil.</b> Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

5000|$|In mycology, <b>a</b> partial <b>veil</b> (also called <b>an</b> inner <b>veil,</b> to {{differentiate}} {{it from the}} [...] "outer" [...] veil, or velum) is a temporary structure of tissue found on the fruiting bodies of some basidiomycete fungi, typically agarics. Its role is to isolate and protect the developing spore-producing surface, represented by gills or tubes, found on the lower surface of the cap. <b>A</b> partial <b>veil,</b> in contrast to <b>a</b> universal <b>veil,</b> extends from the stem surface to the cap edge. The partial veil later disintegrates, once the fruiting body has matured and the spores are ready for dispersal. It might then {{give rise to a}} stem ring, or fragments attached to the stem or cap edge. In some mushrooms, both <b>a</b> partial <b>veil</b> and <b>a</b> universal <b>veil</b> may be present.|$|R
