5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} {{his presence in}} the public eye through meetings and the work of his newspaper, The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of <b>Ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E

Flanders ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a secret}} {{agreement}} originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, {{his support for}} Cuba and similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out. After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made <b>Ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations,</b> resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came to power again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition, Odlum resigned in 2001. Never again returning to power, he died on 28 September 2003 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.|$|E

North Korea was {{not a member of}} the UN and had no representation in the organization.

The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it.|$|E
