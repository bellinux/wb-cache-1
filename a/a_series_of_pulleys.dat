2500|$|Long {{before the}} Restoration spectaculars of the 17th century Lanci was {{designing}} elaborate and complicated theatre sets, using pivoted scenery, {{with up to}} three different scenes painted on boards, thus allowing {{the mood of the}} production to be altered in an instant. One of the earliest examples of this form of scenic change was recorded in 1568 for a performance of [...] the Fabii [...] produced to celebrate the baptism of a daughter of Francesco de' Medici. One of Lanci's [...] most extravagant productions was for a performance of Giovan Battista Cini's La Vedova (The Widow), staged in Florence in [...] 1569, with amazingly extravagant costumes by Bernardo Buontalenti, the event was recorded by the mathematician Ignazio Danti who was so impressed by Lanci's theatrical engineering he included a drawing of his periactoi stage. The periactoi stage setting was basically a series of three sided revolving triangular boards each side with a different scene. Each triangular board was connected, hence there would be one or two flanking the stage, in the wings, and a further section suspended between them on which would be painted skies, cloudy, sunny, dawn or dusk.

50|$|It was {{converted}} to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This {{is thought to be}} the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of woodworking machinery - a rack sawbench, circular saw, thicknesser (planer), and lathes - by <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> belts and <b>pulleys</b> off a central line shaft.|$|R
50|$|In the 1st century AD, Greek {{mathematician}} Heron of Alexandria {{invented the}} first known automatic door. He described two different automatic door applications. The first application used heat from a fire lit by the city's temple priest. After a few hours atmospheric pressure built up in a brass vessel causing it to pump water into adjacent containers. These containers acted as weights that, through <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> ropes and <b>pulleys,</b> would open the temple's doors at about the time people were to arrive for prayer. Heron used a similar application to open the gates to the city.|$|R
50|$|The Swan Boats {{operate in}} the same pond in the Public Garden {{in which they have}} {{operated}} for over 140 years. A Swan Boat ride is a peaceful experience usually lasting about 12-15 minutes. Each boat is powered solely by a driver, often a high school or college student, who pedals the boat like a bicycle. The boats are steered by pulling one of two ropes connected to <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys</b> and a rudder. The Swan Boats remain a Boston tradition and symbol of the city.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{notes for}} the robot appear in sketchbooks that were rediscovered in the 1950s. [...] Leonardo {{is said to}} have {{displayed}} the machine at a celebration hosted by Ludovico Sforza at the court of Milan in 1495. The robot knight could stand, sit, raise its visor and independently maneuver its arms, and had an anatomically correct jaw. The entire robotic system was operated by <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys</b> and cables. Since the discovery of the sketchbook, the robot has been built faithfully based on Leonardo's design, and was found to be fully functional.|$|E
5000|$|Steeper, {{faster and}} longer rope tows {{require the use}} of some sort of [...] "tow gripper". Many were {{designed}} and used in the 1930s and 40s, but the most successful was the [...] "nutcracker" [...] attached to a a harness around the hips. To this is attached a clamp, much like the nutcracker from which it derives its name, which the rider attaches to the rope. This eliminates the need {{to hold on to the}} rope directly, allowing the rope to be supported at waist height by <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys.</b> This system was used on many fields worldwide from the 1940s, and remains popular at 'club fields', especially in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Best, Bill Goldfinch, Tony Rolt {{and several}} other prisoners {{constructed}} a glider out of wood and cloth in an attic {{at the top of}} a Colditz tower from which they planned an airborne escape from the castle. The glider had a 32 ft wingspan and was to be launched from the roof by a catapult that consisted of a bathtub filled with concrete at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> cables and <b>pulleys.</b> <b>As</b> the bathtub fell to the ground, the cables would fling the glider into the air where it would glide for about a mile over the town of Colditz and over the river Mulde. From there Best and another prisoner were planning to walk to a train station and escape by train to Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|One of Lewis' {{favorite}} horses, [...] "Old Kit", {{came into}} play. With <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> ropes and <b>pulleys,</b> <b>a</b> boom pole {{and the horse}} the rafters were slowly lifted into place. Each rafter was raised and nailed into place on the barn's top ring. As {{three or four of}} the rafters were raised into place it became apparent that a high wind could take the partially completed roof structure down, workers hoped for no high winds. Their hopes were granted and no high winds arose until all of the rafters were raised the roof was complete. To top off the dome a cupola roof was added with a lightning rod. At the very top a weather vane was added with a steer said to be covered in gold leaf.|$|R
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> metal <b>pulleys.</b> While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|Chappe's system {{comprised}} {{an intricate}} network of small towers, within visual range of one another.

These rods, called the régulateur (regulator), were operated by trained crews using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys</b> and levers. The four basic positions of the rods could be combined to form 196 different [...] "signs". Provided with good crews of operators and decent visibility conditions, a sign could be sent through the 15 station towers between Paris and Lille, a distance of 193 km, in only 9 minutes, a complete message of 36 signs in about 32 minutes. From Paris to Venice, a message could be sent in only six hours.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} claim {{was for a}} regulating mechanism to keep wheel pointed at an optimum angle based on both the wind speed and direction. The main design problem for windmills is to capture as much power as possible in light wind, but not be damaged or destroyed by high-speed winds. In prior art, windmills had a simple tail vane which kept the wheel pointed directly at the wind, a simple design still in use in decorative garden windmills. Wheeler developed a mechanism that pointed the wheel into the wind at low to moderate wind speeds, but turned the wheel to point obliquely to the wind at high speeds. This was accomplished by the means of a secondary vane which shifted angles, held in an optimum position by weights through <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys.</b> which operated against the main directional vane to optimize the angle.|$|E
50|$|Professor McKenny Hughes {{reported}} that the entrance was blocked with glacial fill until a flood in 1872, when it got washed out. He wriggled round the large boulder and reached the shaft which he estimated as being in excess of 90 m deep. In 1895 Edward Calvert, of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club, attempted to replicate Edouard Martel's descent of the Main Shaft of a few weeks earlier, but failed to get beyond Birkbeck's Ledge at -60 m because of the quantity of water. Looking up, {{he could see that}} the shaft divided behind a curtain. Later in the year he entered Jib Tunnel, and realised that this was the parallel shaft that he had seen, and that a man could be lowered directly {{to the floor of the}} Main Chamber from its lip. The following year, he set up <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> jibs and <b>pulleys,</b> and was lowered in a boatswain's chair, becoming the second person to reach the Main Chamber. Jib Tunnel was used for explorations of the system until 1921, when the current system of lowering the winch from a gantry positioned across the corner of the Main Shaft was developed.|$|R
40|$|The passive sizing system {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> low-profile <b>pulleys</b> {{attached to}} the front and back of the shoulder bearings on a spacesuit soft upper torso (SUT), textile cord or stainless steel cable, and a modified commercial ratchet mechanism. The cord/cable is routed through the pulleys and {{attached to the}} ratchet mechanism mounted {{on the front of the}} spacesuit within reach of the suited subject. Upon actuating the ratchet mechanism, the shoulder bearing breadth is changed, providing variable upper torso sizing. The active system consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> pressurizable nastic cells embedded into the fabric layers of a spacesuit SUT. These cells are integrated {{to the front and}} back of the SUT and are connected to an air source with a variable regulator. When inflated, the nastic cells provide a change in the overall shoulder bearing breadth of the spacesuit and thus, torso sizing. The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and uncoated fabric layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility. It was found that a SUT with a sizing system may solve several problems that have plagued existing HUT designs, and that a SUT with a sizing system may be a viable option for advanced suit architectures...|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} scissor-hinged retractable membrane structures, {{a system}} for retractable membrane roofs that require a fully retractable supporting structure and multiple stable roof-configurations. A vaulted, foldable, supporting structure is developed consisting of two scissor-hinged frames that can retract towards {{opposite sides of the}} space below. Structural membranes are spanned in these frames in a ridge-and-valley configuration to form the roof’s outer surface. Actuators are integrated to control the tension in the membrane surface in different roof-configurations. Transformation from one configuration to another is controlled by cables running through the supporting structure over <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The characteristics <b>of</b> these components are discussed, and their implementation illustrated with a design for a retractable roof over a tennis arena. The structural behaviour of this roof is analysed under representative load conditions. A procedure for such analyses using conventional software tools for the design and analysis of tensile surface structures is presented...|$|R
5000|$|The {{handrail}} {{provides a}} handhold for passengers {{while they are}} riding the escalator. The handrail is pulled along its own track by a chain that {{is connected to the}} main drive gear by <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys,</b> keeping it at the same speed as the steps. Four distinct sections make up the rail: at its center is a [...] "slider", also known as a [...] "glider ply," [...] which is a layer of a cotton or synthetic textile that allows the rail to move smoothly along its track. The [...] "tension member" [...] lies on the slider and consists of either steel cable or flat steel tape, providing the handrail with tensile strength and flexibility. The inner components, on top of the tension member, are made of chemically treated rubber designed to prevent the layers from separating. Finally, the outer layerthe part that passengers see—is the cover, typically a blend of synthetic polymers and rubber. Covers are designed to resist degradation from environmental conditions, mechanical wear and tear and vandalism.|$|E
50|$|But {{the little}} canary is still outside! It pecks {{on the window}} until heard by Buddy, who awakens again to try the same {{technique}} he attempted before. The book as a bridge, {{he goes to the}} window, but instead now requires help in order to open it. He calls for Atlas, who, having changed his original position, again releases his globe and goes over to help Buddy. Atlas removes Buddy from the window and opens it. Buddy briefly steps out to fetch the freezing bird. Once inside again, Buddy dusts the snow from the poor creature's back whilst Atlas closes the window. By means of <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys</b> on window blinds and a luminaire, Buddy hurries the canary to a small dish held aloft by a statuette, under which he places a cigarette lighter, whose heat melts the ice block around the bird's feet. Now sitting in a pool of water, the canary sneezes, splashing its rescuer, who then injoins the bird to blow its nose. Feeling quite chipper again, the bird thanks Buddy by means of a kiss, then flits about the room, eventually turning on the radio.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, the brothers, {{along with}} a cousin, opened the Iceland rink, which proved very popular, {{in no small part}} because Frank had devised a way to {{eliminate}} rippling caused by the pipes that were laid down to keep the rink frozen. (The rink still operates and is still owned by the Zamboni family.) He obtained a patent for that innovation in 1946. Then, in 1949, he invented a machine that transformed the job of resurfacing an ice rink from a five-man, 90-minute task to a one-man, 15-minute job. The initial machine included a hydraulic cylinder from an A-20 attack plane, a chassis from an oil derrick, a Jeep engine, a wooden bin to catch the shavings, and <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulleys.</b> His son, Richard, said, [...] "It took him nine years. One of the reasons he stuck with it was that everyone told him he was crazy." [...] Zamboni did not expect to make more but, after seeing the machine, Sonja Henie immediately ordered two, and then the Chicago Black Hawks placed an order. Zamboni applied for a patent in 1949 - obtained in 1953 - and set up Frank J. Zamboni & Co. in Paramount to build and sell the machines.|$|E
