Farmer's third wife died from cancer in 1992; speaking three years later, he remarked that [...] "I guess I never will really recover from that because we had been together for over 20 years when she died". After his own death, he was described as being survived by his companion and manager, Lynne Mueller, and son.|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{played out}} {{on-screen}} when Belle discovers she has cancer. Aden only discovers the truth just before their wedding. Belle refuses treatment because her cancer is so advanced {{she does not}} want to [...] "prolong her agony". Aden is [...] "confused, devastated, and completely and utterly heartbroken". Lasance said Aden is [...] "destroyed" [...] and feels like he is also dying in the process, because Aden has never given himself to anyone - he feels Belle is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Tovey explained that Belle is worried about Aden's frame of mind on their wedding day. The scriptwriters played the scenes in a way that kept viewers unsure whether or not Aden would attend his wedding. While Belle [...] "truly believes he will show up", Tovey explains the tone and mood of the wedding is unhappy. Aden marries Belle, and she dies a couple of weeks later.|$|E
500|$|The Zhuangzi {{interprets the}} {{universe}} as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious God or will driving it, and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously. It argues that because of humans' advanced cognitive abilities, they {{have a tendency to}} create artificial distinctionssuch as good versus bad, large versus small, usefulness versus uselessness, and social systems like Confucianismthat remove themselves from the natural spontaneity of the universe. In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans. As Burton Watson described, [...] "the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become so much <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success." [...] The term [...] "wandering" [...] (yóu遊) is used throughout the stories of the Zhuangzi to describe how an enlightened person [...] "wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Rodgers uses {{music in}} Carousel in subtle ways to {{differentiate}} characters {{and tell the}} audience of their emotional state. In [...] "You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan", the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even eighth-note rhythms, whereas the emotionally restless Julie's music is marked by dotted eighths and sixteenths; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show. When Billy whistles a snatch of the song, he selects Julie's dotted notes rather than Carrie's. Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as-yet unborn Louise, when Billy sings in [...] "Soliloquy" [...] of his daughter, who [...] "gets hungry every night", he uses Julie's dotted rhythms. Such rhythms also characterize Julie's Act 2 song, [...] "What's the Use of Wond'rin'". The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life, but hers as well. This is reflected in [...] "When the Children Are Asleep", where the two sing in close harmony, but Enoch musically interrupts his intended's turn at the chorus with the words [...] "Dreams that won't be interrupted". Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block, in his book on the Broadway musical, points out that though Billy may strike his wife, he allows her musical themes to become <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and never interrupts her music. Block suggests that, as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions, Enoch requiring Carrie to act as [...] "the little woman", and his having nine children with her (more than she had found acceptable in [...] "When the Children are Asleep") can {{be considered to be}} even more abusive.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} of the Legion of Super-Heroes {{television}} series features a future version of Superman alongside the Clark Kent version. This second Superman called Kell-El [...] or Ezekiel Kent aka Superman X (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) is a clone of the original Superman; he's from the 41st century and was created to oppose the villainous being Imperiex. Kell-El has a different variety of powers than Superman and is immune to kryptonite due to it being <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The character's concept {{is based on the}} Kon-El Superboy, Eradicator, and Lar Gand, wearing a costume that is similar to Kon-El's costume from Superboy #83, worn towards the end of his series and before Young Justice was disbanded.|$|E
2500|$|Waiting {{for him is}} Leah, who trapped him in the box in {{the hope}} of {{teaching}} him an important lesson about his magic. [...] But the lesson hasn't been learned in the way that she hoped, because of Tim's focus on the small scale: it wasn't the destruction of the forest that prompted him to reconnect with his magic, but the threat to the single tree. [...] Exasperatingly, Leah cannot even decide if Tim is wholly wrong in thinking that way. [...] Instead, she leaves Tim with the important reminder that he might try to throw away his magic, but he will never wholly succeed: it is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and always will be.|$|E

The newly established district was named after the ancient town of Qinnasrin which was located within its boundaries. Under the Umayyads, Jund Qinnasrin composed of three districts: Antioch, Aleppo, and Manbij.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent {{about a year}} training in their [...] "New Japan Dojo" [...] with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the name The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like Jushin Thunder Liger, Shinjiro Otani, Black Tiger, and El Samurai in their junior heavyweight division.|$|E
2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches on his lips were given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E
2500|$|Extremely disgruntled by the experience, the new Warlock left Thanos {{to ponder}} his situation, and he {{eventually}} {{ended up on}} [...] "New Krall" [...] acting as a gladiator in a fighting pit. Thanos receives a message through time/space from his omnipotent former self to seek this new Adam Warlock who is now unnaturally more powerful than before. Agreeing, Thanos first seeks Pip the Troll to teleport to New Krall and then contacts Gamora to also go to Adam, as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe. During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source {{that turns out to}} be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall. The Shi'ar, led by Gladiator (also looking for the power source), appear and Annihilus, now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability, defeats them. Pip swiftly teleports Adam, Gamora, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and himself back to the Guardians' ship to safety and are joined by Thanos, where they discover the universe that Adam created was not destroyed, but became <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and has given him the power of Eternity and Infinity.|$|E

However, Jean Grey (who was becoming increasingly powerful due to {{a manifestation of the}} Phoenix entity) was able to split Xavier's consciousness into pieces and store <b>a</b> little <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in every single living mutant mind. When Cassandra used Cerebra and focused on all the mutants, the pieces of Xavier's mind were brought back together; at the same time, Jean Grey telepathically attacked, successfully defeating Cassandra, and forcing her out of Xavier's body.|$|R
50|$|When he {{returned}} from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as <b>a</b> separate <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was incorporated into his body. The alien Q`wrrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle-suit; some <b>of</b> his mechanical <b>parts</b> were visible {{on the surface of}} his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Q`wrrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.|$|R

[...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers were saying that Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote the beginning of the couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other. The dislike became an attraction that resulted in a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] type of story. [...] "We can't even define it as a romance," [...] Nader said. [...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. <b>A</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> shut down. But now, there is a whole other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E
