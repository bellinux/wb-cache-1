40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{one of the}} two new {{proposals for}} beam-column interaction formulae, which will be made <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the forthcoming <b>EN</b> version of Eurocode 3. It is based on second-order in-plane elasticity, and has been derived in order to exhibit an understandable physical background, as well as accuracy and consistency with the other resistance and stability formulae of the code. The formulae ensure all the required continuities: between the cross-section classes, from plasticity to elasticity when slenderness and axial force are increasing, and continuity between all the individual stability member checks and cross-section verifications. The paper shows how the basic format may be extended to cover a wider range of cases, i. e. spatial elastic-plastic behaviour with possible lateral-torsional buckling. Through an extensive comparison with the results of FEM numerical simulations of about 15 000 beam-columns, the proposal is found to be safe and accurate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conceived as a set of web based services, DOPA provides a broad set of free and open source tools to assess, monitor and even forecast the state of and pressure on protected areas at local, regional and global scale. DOPA Explorer 1. 0 is a web based interface <b>available</b> <b>in</b> four languages (<b>EN,</b> FR, ES, PT) providing simple means to explore the nearly 16, 000 protected areas that are at least as large as 100 km 2. Distinguishing between terrestrial, marine and mixed protected areas, DOPA Explorer 1. 0 can help end users to identify those with most unique ecosystems and species, and assess the pressures they are exposed to because of human development. Recognized by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as a reference information system, DOPA Explorer is based on the best global data sets available and provides means to rank protected areas at the country and ecoregion levels. Inversely, DOPA Explorer indirectly highlights the protected areas for which information is incomplete. We finally invite the end-users of DOPA to engage with us through the proposed communication platforms to help improve our work to support the safeguarding of biodiversity. JRC.
