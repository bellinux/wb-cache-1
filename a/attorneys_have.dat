5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attorneys</b> <b>have</b> long used {{peremptory}} {{challenges to}} exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffsâ€™ <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E

25|$|Davis argued 140 {{cases before}} the US Supreme Court during his career. 73 were as Solicitor General, and 67 {{as a private}} lawyer. Lawrence Wallace, who retired from the Office of the Solicitor General in 2003, argued 157 cases during his career but many believe that few <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> argued more cases than Davis. Daniel Webster and Walter Jones are {{believed}} to have argued more cases than Davis, but they were lawyers of a much earlier era.|$|E
25|$|Some patent <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} this decision since, while {{the merits of}} Macrossan's case might have been arguable, {{it was felt that}} there are issues with the law that require resolving. Consequently, there is disappointment at this missed opportunity to better establish where the boundary lies between patentable and non-patentable software. The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure have expressed the view that the decision of the House of Lords confirms that the correctness of the Court of Appeal.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{emerged in}} 2000 {{as the largest}} {{contributor}} to Senatorial candidate Hillary Clinton. Paul and his <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> at various times offered two explanations for this. First, {{that he was trying}} to attract her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, to serve on the board of Stan Lee Media after leaving office. Second, that he hoped to negotiate a pardon for his previous criminal convictions. Paul produced and underwrote what he described as the largest fund raising event ever held for a federal candidate, in Los Angeles, days before the 2000 Democratic Convention began. The Hollywood Farewell Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton featured prominent entertainers singing for the President, while raising over $1 million for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The event cost $1.9 million to organize according to Paul and $500,000 according to the Federal Election Commission filing, much of it borrowed fraudulently by Paul from Merrill Lynch. Later indictments would state that Merrill Lynch lost about $5 million it had lent to Paul.|$|E
25|$|Trials are public, and {{defendants}} {{have the}} right to legal counsel and to call defense witnesses in the federal and some provincial courts that have an accusatory system of criminal justice. If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when defendants face serious criminal charges. During the investigative stage, defendants can submit questions in writing to the investigating judge. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments in criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions. Although the 1994 constitution provides for trial by jury, implementing legislation had not been passed by year's end. In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of certain serious crimes {{have the right}} to a trial by jury. Lengthy delays in trials are a nationwide problem, with many cases taking five or more years to resolve. Defendants are presumed innocent and {{have the right to}} appeal, as do prosecutors. Minors under age 16 cannot be criminally prosecuted. By law defendants and <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> access to government held evidence, but they may experience significant obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence. In 2008, the human rights organization Fundacion Sur noted that the country lacked a separate juvenile justice system that affords adolescents due process protections and the right to a legal defense in criminal cases and expressed concern that the broad discretion judges have in such cases increased the possibility of arbitrary rulings. The age of legal liability is 16, and Fundacion Sur asserted that 16- and 17-year-old offenders frequently were transferred to adult criminal courts or held in juvenile detention centers for longer periods than warranted by their offenses. A December 2008 Supreme Court decision found that the country's juvenile justice system did not comply with international conventions and highlighted the need for the legislative branch to remedy the situation.|$|E
500|$|<b>Attorneys</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that}} because digital {{evidence}} can theoretically be altered it undermines {{the reliability of}} the evidence. US judges are beginning to reject this theory, in the case US v. Bonallo the court ruled that [...] "the fact {{that it is possible to}} alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness." [...] In the United Kingdom guidelines such as those issued by ACPO are followed to help document the authenticity and integrity of evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Proposition 65 remains {{politically}} controversial {{even after}} 25 years, {{in large part}} because, in effect, it puts {{the burden of proof}} on business instead of government to make a key scientific determination about safety levels for specific toxic chemicals that the businesses are knowingly exposing members of the public to. [...] According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, [...] "Proposition 65 has... increased public awareness about the adverse effects of exposures to listed chemicals.... provided an incentive for manufacturers to remove listed chemicals from their products.... Although Proposition 65 has benefited Californians, it has come at a cost for companies doing business in the state." [...] The law has also been criticized for the proliferation of [...] "bounty hunter" [...] lawsuits. <b>Attorneys</b> <b>have</b> collected {{more than two-thirds of the}} money paid by businesses to settle Proposition 65 lawsuits since 2000.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "CSI effect" [...] is a {{reference}} to the alleged phenomenon of CSI raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of forensic science, especially crime scene investigation and DNA testing. This is said to have changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court. Victims and their families are coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a [...] "smoking gun" [...] for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of CSI on jury members. Some police and district <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> criticized the show for giving members of the public an inaccurate perception of how police solve crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Some tax protesters (and {{occasionally}} persons {{brought before}} courts) {{have argued that}} because the titles of court cases identify the parties in all capital letters, the persons thus identified are [...] "fictitious entities". In other words, a court hearing a case titled [...] "STATE v. JOHN Q. SMITH" [...] has no authority over the defendant, [...] "John Q. Smith", because the capitalization of the name means the court is addressing a person who does not exist. Such an argument was made by Eddie Ray Kahn, a co-defendant of Wesley Snipes in the latter's high-profile tax evasion case. Kahn [...] "made several missteps and peculiar motions. For example, he sought to be immediately freed because the indictment lists his name in all capital letters, and he claimed U.S. <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> no jurisdiction because Florida supposedly was never ceded to the federal government". The court denied these motions.|$|E
2500|$|The Hague Convention {{is widely}} viewed as {{completely}} ineffective in Mexico with the country being extensively cited as having problems with nearly every aspect of its implementation. [...] Oftentimes children can not be located for Convention proceedings to start due to problems with law enforcements performance. [...] Law enforcement has reported an inability to locate children even when parents have reported giving them the children's exact address in Mexico. [...] Although, Mexico claims to provide free legal representation for victim parents the provided representation is often completely unable to move the case forward and will only represent the parent during the natural trial, not during appeals. [...] Parents who {{have been able to}} gain traction in Mexican courts have turned to private attorneys. [...] Even when these <b>attorneys</b> <b>have</b> won favorable verdicts they are not enforced if the abductor files appeals or amparos which suspend enforcement of the decision until they've been adjudicated, frequently causing years of delays. [...] In the unlikely event that children are located, legal proceedings commence, all appeals are heard and a final return order is issued, the abductor may appeal {{the manner in which the}} order is enforced (though it is less likely that enforcement will be suspended in such cases.) [...] Once all judicial hurdles to enforcement have been cleared law enforcement issues can arise anew due to their inability to locate children as in the case of the Combe-Rivas abduction where, after four years, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a final decision ordering the child's return in June 2009. [...] To date the decision remains unenforced due to an inability to locate the child.|$|E
