Thick bristle type fibres will often protrude from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions.

5|$|From about 4000 BC, Neolithic {{settlers}} arrived introducing cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such {{cattle and}} sheep, large timber building, and stone monuments. Field systems {{were developed in}} different parts of Ireland, including at the Céide Fields, that has been preserved beneath <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.|$|E
5|$|East Texas {{outcrops}} {{consist of}} Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite. The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and {{out on the}} Texas continental shelf contain oil. Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area. <b>A</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer. Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react with <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major {{issue with the}} fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} to use the neutrons to breed additional fission fuel in <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> nuclear waste, a concept known as a fission-fusion hybrid.

25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} with pieces of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar so that it is visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> pictures and patterns.|$|E
25|$|Most of Chile's premium wine {{regions are}} {{dependent}} on irrigation to sustain vineyards, getting the necessary water from melting snow caps in the Andes.

For the rest of Chile's wine regions, the Coastal Ranges serve a buffer from the current and also acts as a rain shadow.

25|$|Gunpowder smoke {{added to}} <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>of</b> fog {{soon after the}} battle began. This smoke and fog made it nearly {{impossible}} for the opposing forces {{to see each other}} except by crouching down low. This served to help the defenders more since they were mainly lying behind their works and not attempting to get to them through the mud as the Confederate attackers were attempting to do. They also could simply fire into a narrow area where the Confederates had to attack and achieve effective results. The mud and standing water prevented cavalry and artillery from participating much in the battle. In fact, the Confederates lost three artillery pieces to a charge by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry and the 29th Iowa Infantry regiments from their fortified positions.|$|E
