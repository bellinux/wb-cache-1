5|$|The nuthatches <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name {{derived from}} , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch {{refers to the}} {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
