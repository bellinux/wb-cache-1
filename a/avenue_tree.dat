40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the potentials of Geographic Information System (GIS) as a management tool for <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> (Street trees) populations in small communities (using Idi-Ishin community, Ibadan, Nigeria {{as a case}} study). GIS is a decision support system which integrate data or set of data from different sources, bringing them under the same referencing system in a computer system. An Ikonos Imagery (1 m Spatial Resolution) {{of the study area}} was digitized to produce a digital map using ArcGIS 10. 1 version. The <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> species ≥ 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) was selected for enumeration. These trees were then measured and tagged. The Height, Girth and Geographic location (X &Y coordinate) of the trees were measured with Haga altimeter, Girthing tape and Hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) respectively. The species and families of the trees enumerated were also identified. Data were analysed for basal area (BA) and volume (V). A total number of 43 <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> were assessed in Idi-Ishin Community. Roystonea regia accounted {{for the majority of the}} <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> (25. 58 %), followed by Polyanthia longiflora (23. 26 %), Gliricida seprium (20. 93 %), Eucalyptus toreliana (13. 95 %), Delunix regea (6. 98 %). However Terminalia catapa, Terminalia radii, Azadrachita indica and Newbodia levis had the same abundance of 2. 33 %. It was also observed that the benefits derived from these <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> includes; Carbon sequestration, Beautification, Wind break and shade. A spatial relational database was created for the assessed <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> using ArcCatalog of ArcGIS 10. 1 version. Based on the findings from the study (which serves as baseline information for the management of the <b>avenue</b> <b>trees</b> in the study area), it was therefore recommended that subsequent assessment should be carried out at 3 - 5 year interval in other to ensure proper and continuous monitoring and updating of the data...|$|R

5000|$|Today the Knickerbocker Greys meet every Tuesday {{afternoon}} from 4:45 - 6pm {{during the}} school year at the Park Avenue Armory between 66th and 67th Streets on Park Avenue. The focus of these weekly meetings is to learn traditional marching and drill routines, but the ultimate aim is for the participants to learn more than these drills. The main goal of the Greys is that in the process of this training, cadets develop leadership skills: such as how to motivate others; how to deal with them correctly; and how to command a group of inferior individuals. The Greys also encourage a community within the corps, leading to friendships between older and younger cadets, by not only drilling, but going on trips, learning about American history, and even having parties and games. The Greys also build confidence, by instilling in each cadet a sense of discipline, leadership, compassion and orderliness. As cadets master the military Drill and Ceremony, they pass on their skills onto younger cadets. This helps cadets in many areas, from leadership to public speaking. As one Cadet Colonel said, “I used to be really shy and I had a serious fear of public speaking, my experiences at the Greys helped me a lot, step by step. And since then, as cadet Colonel, I’ve learned a lot about confidence, leadership, and how to teach younger cadets.” [...] Cadets are also instructed in etiquette and learn how to “meet and greet” while acting as color guards for several historical societies and civic events in New York. Some of the annual events include the Father Cadet dinner, marching in the Veteran's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue, George Washington's Inauguration re-enactment, wreath laying at The Soldier's and Sailor's Monument on Memorial Day, Color Guard for the Park <b>Avenue</b> <b>Tree</b> Lighting, Color Guards for the Union League Club, the St. George's Society’s English Ball, the Sons of the Revolution dinner, and the Daughters of the American Revolution ball, and Military Order of Foreign Wars.|$|E

40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the effects of}} <b>avenues</b> of <b>trees</b> in urban street canyons on traffic pollutant dispersion. We describe various wind-tunnel experiments with different tree-avenue models in combination with variations in street-canyon aspect ratio W/H (with W the street-canyon width and H the building height) and approaching wind direction. Compared to tree-free street canyons, in general, higher pollutant concentrations are found. <b>Avenues</b> of <b>trees</b> do not suppress canyon vortices, although the air ventilation in canyons is hindered significantly. For a perpendicular wind direction, increases in wall-average and wall-maximum concentrations at the leeward canyon wall and decreases in wall-average concentrations at the windward wall are found. For oblique and perpendicular wind directions, increases at both canyon walls are obtained. The strongest effects of <b>avenues</b> of <b>trees</b> on traffic pollutant dispersion are observed for oblique wind directions for which also the largest concentrations at the canyon walls are found. Thus, the prevailing assumption that attributes the most harmful dispersion conditions to a perpendicular wind direction does not hold for street canyons with <b>avenues</b> of <b>trees.</b> Furthermore, following dimensional analysis, {{an estimate of the}} normalized wall-maximum traffic pollutant concentration in street canyons with <b>avenues</b> of <b>trees</b> is derived...|$|R

40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indicaA. Juss.) is a {{multipurpose}} agroforestry {{tree that}} is well adapted {{to a wide range}} of climatic and soil conditions and has gained worldwide recognition for its pharmaceutical and pesticidal properties. The world's largest pure Neem plantations are available in the plains of Arafat, Saudi Arabia where 50, 000 thousands Neem trees were planted to provide shade from the blazing summer sun for the millions of Hajis (Muslim pilgrims). Sporadic mature Neem trees are also found in Medinah, Taif and elsewhereof the Kingdom. The Neem tree is adapted to Arafat under harsh climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia and the plantation may be extended to other parts of the Kingdom as a <b>avenue</b> <b>tree</b> and also to minimize the desertification under changing climatic conditions and to improve the environmental condition of the country. At Arafat mixed plantations may be advocated to save the present plantation which may come from climate change as well as pest and diseases problems. So care must be taken to monitor the diseases of Neem tree at Arafat on a regularbasis. Because of insufficient growth of Neem at Arafat the methods of green cultivation with microbial inoculants, organic fertilizers, mycotrophic green manure plants may be practiced for successful plantation...|$|E
40|$|Parkia biglandulosa, {{a native}} of Malaya. The genus is named after Mungo Park. It is a large handsome, {{evergreen}} tree. Flowers are small, ball-shaped, and brown initially turning to white, in pendant flower heads on long stalks. Flowering is in March to April. Propagation is by seeds. The plant is grown in gardens as ornamental tree and also on roadsides as <b>avenue</b> <b>tree.</b> Fruit pulp {{is reported to be}} edible. Pollen mixed with water makes a refreshing drink. The different parts of the plant shows anti ulcer activity, Antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, anti inflammatory activity etc. Saponin’s from the seed bran of Parkia biglandulosa is used medicinally in India for its astringent and detergent properties and also as a fish poison. lectins from Parkia biglandulosa also have mitogenicity and antiproliferative activity. This present research paper mainly focused on the quantitative estimation of its constituents by using HPTLC and FTIR. After the extraction with petroleum ether and methanol the active constituents were found to be sterols. Crude plant extracts are generally a mixture of active and non-active compounds. The quantitative estimation of all active constituents is very important for pharmacological point.

40|$|In Europe Aesculus ×carnea Hayne is {{planted in}} cities as an <b>avenue</b> <b>tree.</b> Compared to A. hippocastanum L., {{it is more}} drought {{resistant}}, but less resistant to low temperatures. A. ×carnea is a lower tree than A. hippocastanum and develops a smaller corolla. It produces dark green, shiny and crinkled leaves. Its flowers have different colours, from bright pink to carmine red. The nectary glands secrete nectar abundantly. Due to the long corolla tube, nectar is difficult to reach for bees. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the topography and micromorphology of the nectaries of A. ×carnea using scanning electron microscopy. The study shows that the nectary gland of red horse chestnut forms an incomplete ring around the base of the staminal filaments, surrounding only four stamens out of the seven that occur in the flower. Three stamens are outside the nectary. In its widest place, the nectary diameter reaches 2. 7 mm. Three expanded portions of the gland can bee seen in the marginal part of the nectary, adjoining the petals. The part of the nectary adjacent to the filaments forms a convex protrusion with a wavy appearance (shape), which results from the vicinity of the filaments. Nectar is secreted through numerous stomata located beneath the convex part of the nectary. The stoma length is 21. 7 μm, while the width 23. 3 μm. In the material examined, most stomata had open pores. Secretion was observed in many places. The stomata were surrounded by 6 - 7 guard cells; this allows them to be classified as the cyclocytic type. The cells of the stomatal complex were raised above the surface of the other epidermal cells. The walls of the guard cells and of the adjacent epidermal cells were covered by a cuticle with irregular striation...|$|E
