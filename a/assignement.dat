40|$|This {{article is}} dealing with an {{alternative}} method of localization. It proposes to use sketch based input as {{a description of the}} users location or a remote place. Sketches are assumed to be map like drawings in two dimensions that can be assembled on a computer screen for direct interpretation by a processing tool. For the localization process a common representation of the sketch and the reference data must be derived from some basic properties of both data sets. Sketches are an imprecise representation of the thoughts a person has about a situation and emphasizes the relations between objects. This relations are of a topological nature and do not represent a precise geometrie. The properties are leading to a data structure for the search process that is organized as a semantical network, modelling the objects and relations as nodes of a graph. This graph is the foundation on which a search algorithm can be build. It aims on finding a sketched situation in a reference data set by scanning through the reference and finding corresponding nodes of the semantical networks. Therefore a constraint tree search approach is used. It is growing a state tree while exploring potential <b>assignements</b> of nodes. The search space is restricted by constraints that are applied to potential <b>assignements</b> of objects in the sketch and in the reference. Some examples are shown to illustrate this process...|$|R

50|$|On July 29, 1938 the Terç was {{deployed}} in the Vilalba dels Arcs sector (Tarragona province) and for 10 days successfully fought a defensive battle. Then for a week it was shuttled by trucks and on foot between different sectors with no real combat until it returned to Vilalba, this time with offensive <b>assignement.</b> During the attack of August 19 the Terç lost around 60 KIA and 170 WIA on the Cuatro Caminos crossroad and was engaged in heavy fighting also during the following days, until on August 30 it was moved to more quiet sectors. Total losses reached 700, including 150 KIA. While the recovering wounded were coming back to line and new recruits were arriving, the Terç remained in the Ebro bend on vigilance and patrolling duties. Massive casualties suffered, sometimes described as self-immolation, are subject to controversy until today.In mid-December 1938 in Fatarella the battalion was loaded onto trains and in early January 1939 it was deployed back in southern Extremadura, this time engaged in defensive operations against the last Republican offensive of the war. During the counter-offensive the unit captured Valsequillo before early February it was transported by train to Navalmoral. It was then transferred to Chozas de Canales (Toledo) and in late March moved by trucks to Albarreal de Tajo, advancing with virtually no resistance. The Terç ended the war in Menasalbas.|$|E
5000|$|In poetry Cristóbal Botella y Serra kept {{publishing}} poetry under pen-names in Integrist periodicals like El Siglo Futuro {{until he}} died in unclear circumstances in the early 1920s.. Another Carlist poetic offshoot was Florentino Soria López, who abandoned Jaimismo and sided with the rebellious Mellistas, later amalgamating into primoderiverista institutions. The old orthodox party executive José Pascual de Liñán y Eguizábal also went on with poetic pieces, his classic verses praising traditional Spanish virtues, commenting ongoing events and honoring great men of Carlism. Interestingly, some foreigners considered him [...] "the best Spanish poet". A poet from the younger generation, Manuel García-Sañudo, whose literary Carlist zeal carried him behind bars during the late Restoration years, moved from early lyrics of Sonetos provincianos (1915) and Romance de pobres almas (1916) to more belligerent strophes related to his <b>assignement</b> to Morocco. Luis Carpio Moraga, a writer from Baeza, wrote a sonnet in honour of the Carlist politician Juan Vázquez de Mella {{a few days before}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Last but not least, on the vanguard end there was José María Hinojosa, the young Carlist jefe in the province of Málaga and contributor to Spanish surrealist poetry; however, instead of Carlist themes he advanced somewhat icononoclastic vision. Hinojosa, along Torralba de Damas, Carpio Moraga and Rico Ariza, is among Carlist writers killed by their political opponents. In Gallego the Traditionalist poetry was contributed by Enrique García-Rendueles.|$|E

The unique interior design, with numerous works of Fine and Applied Arts, which make the {{integral part of the}} building, gives the Palace the character of some kind of a gallery of Yugoslav 2oth century art. The interior, as well as the exterior design was supposed to reflect the power, the greatness, the stability and the integrity of new Yugoslavia. The interior decoration design included artistic decoration of the walls with the mosaic technique, graffiti and fresco-painting, as well as by placing free-standing sculptures and reliefs, which was the specific <b>assignement</b> given to the special artistic commission. The design of the lounges dedicated to all six of the federal republics of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, located in {{the central part of the}} palace, was based on the accentuation of the traditional motifs, characteristic for every federal unit of the country. The Yugoslav lounge represented the largest and at the same time the most representative room in the palace. The peculiar design of this lounge was seen in the monumental frescoes by Petar Lubarda, and Lazar Vujaklija, as well as the triptych-mosaic The Creation of Yugoslavia, the work of Mladen Srbinović.
