40|$|We study {{deception}} {{choices and}} deception detection in a tax compliance experiment. We find large systematic differences in individual deception <b>abilities.</b> <b>Tax</b> payers are conscious {{about their own}} deception abilities. The empirical outcomes {{are in line with}} a theory suggesting that tax payers make their choices whether to underreport or report truthfully {{on the basis of their}} own deception <b>ability.</b> <b>Tax</b> payers with high deception ability are more likely to underreport. This selection effect is stronger if the fines for underreporting are higher.

40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax interacts {{specifically}} with the cellular transcription factor CREB and the viral 21 -bp repeat element {{to form a}} Tax-CREB-DNA ternary complex which mediates activation of viral mRNA transcription. Analyses of Tax and Tax mutants indicate that, like CREB, Tax incorporates into the ternary complex as a dimer. The <b>ability</b> of <b>Tax</b> to form a dimer is necessary for its interaction with CREB and the 21 -bp element. Analyses of several Tax mutants with amino acid substitutions spanning residues 123 to 204 indicate that intersubunit Tax dimerization correlates with its ability to assemble into the ternary complex and activate transcription. Tax also enhances the DNA binding activities of specific bZip domains in vitro. The <b>ability</b> of <b>Tax</b> to enhance DNA binding of bZip proteins can be explained in part by Tax dimerization.

40|$|The {{present study}} has as {{objective}} {{to analyze the}} concept of sovereignty, the existence or not of the sovereignty tax in Brazil and its implications on the federative pact and <b>abilities</b> <b>taxes</b> on MERCOSUR. It stands out the concern {{of one of the}} freedoms of the block, the free circulation of goods and services. The sovereignty of the State lodges the fiscal sovereignty or tax. In international scope, the fiscal sovereignty or tax is reflected as full capacity of a State ahead of excessively in the international scene. The State has fiscal sovereignty when it edits its laws, when its will is the last one to prevail how much to managed it's, and the fiscal sovereignty exceeds the territory of the State, when its <b>ability</b> <b>tax</b> reaches its contributors where it wants that they are. The applicability of the constant norms in International Treatys elapses the postulate of sovereignty, as concern the juridical power, which its concept discloses a supremacy character, distinguishing itself from the sovereignty of the State directed to all of its territory and in the reciprocal relations between the States. After that, treaty and the tax treaty are analysed more deeply. Such implications reflect in Brazil’s Reformation Tax and the adjustments assumed by MERCOSUR’s members. O presente estudo tem o objetivo de analisar o conceito de soberania, da existência ou não da soberania tributária no Brasil e suas implicações com o pacto federativo e competências tributárias face ao MERCOSUL. Ressalta a preocupação de uma das liberdades do bloco, a livre circulação de bens e de serviços. A soberania do Estado alberga a soberania fiscal ou tributária. Em âmbito internacional, a soberania fiscal ou tributária reflete-se como capacidade plena de um Estado diante dos demais no cenário internacional. O Estado tem soberania fiscal quando edita suas leis, quando a sua vontade é a última a prevalecer quanto aos seus administrados, e a soberania fiscal ultrapassa o território do Estado, quando sua competência tributária alcança seus contribuintes onde quer que eles estejam. A aplicabilidade das normas constantes nos tratados decorre do postulado da soberania, como abordou-se acima, cujo conceito revela um caráter de supremacia, concernente ao poder jurídico, distinguindo-se da soberania do Estado dirigida a todos de seu território e nas relações recíprocas entre os Estados. A seguir, referir-se-á ao assunto tratado de forma ampla e depois do tratado em matéria tributária.

40|$|The Tax protein encoded {{by human}} T cell leukemia virus type I transactivates the viral {{promoter}} by forming a complex with several cellular factors bound to three repeats {{of a specific}} upstream regulatory sequence. We have shown that transactivation by Tax was correlated with its ability {{to interact with the}} C-terminal moiety of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP). In the present study, the <b>ability</b> of <b>Tax</b> to interact with several human TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) was analyzed. We show that Tax interacts selectively with hTAFII 28 in transfected HeLa cells. A direct interaction between Tax and hTAFII 28 was also observed in vitro with purified proteins. In transient expression studies we show that overexpression of hTAFII 28 significantly increased transactivation by Tax, both in the absence and in the presence of overexpressed TBP. The ability of hTAFII 28 to potentiate transactivation correlated with the <b>ability</b> of <b>Tax</b> to interact with hTAFII 28 and also with the ability of hTAFII 28 to interact with TBP. Coexpression of TBP and hTAFII 28 resulted in an additive increase in transactivation by Tax. From these observations we propose that transcriptional activation by Tax involves multiple interactions with TFIID via its TBP and hTAFII 28 subunits...|$|R
