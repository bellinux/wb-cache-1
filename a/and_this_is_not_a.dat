In almost all cases, one endospore is formed <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> reproductive process, although Anaerobacter {{can make up}} to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.

[...] Pruce maintained WoW's legal right to pray as they choose at the Wall, and advised members of Women for the Wall to pray at private synagogues if they view their freedom of religion as offensive. She stated on 7 July, the day before Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the Hebrew month) of Av that she truly welcomes traditional women at the Kotel. The next day stated, [...] "The women's section was full of seminary students bussed in for the purpose of blocking out Women of the Wall". An article in The Forward stated of the Rosh CHodesh Av gathering, [...] "... the biggest group on hand that morning was a crowd of some 5,000 to 7,000 young women standing silently in the women's prayer area ... Filling the women's section and spilling out into the wider plaza, the girls each prayed on their own. When they were done, they left without raising their voices." ...|$|E

60|$|Last Thursday was St Peter's Day. The {{congregation}} on {{that day}} was, as far as I could perceive, no larger than usual; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> matter of surprise. Since we gave up at the Reformation the superstitious practice of praying to the saints, saints' days have sunk--and indeed sunk too much--into neglect. For most men's religion has a touch of self-interest in it; and therefore when people discovered {{that they could get}} nothing out of St Peter or St John by praying to them, they began to forget the very memory, many of them, of St Peter, St John, and other saints and apostles. They forget, too often, still, that though praying to any saint, or angel, or other created being, is contrary both to reason and to Scripture; yet it is according to reason and to Scripture to commemorate them. That is to remember them, to study their characters, and to thank God for them--both for the virtues which He bestowed on them, and the example which He has given us in them.|$|E
6000|$|Already the {{increase}} of books is passing into geometrical progression. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> little remarkable when we {{bear in mind that}} in Great Britain, of which I speak, while there is a vast supply of cheap works, what are termed [...] "new publications" [...] issue from the press, for the most part, at prices fabulously high, so that the class of real purchasers has been extirpated, leaving behind as buyers only a few individuals who might almost be counted on the fingers, while the effective circulation depends upon middle-men through the engine of circulating libraries. These are not so much owners as distributers of books, and they mitigate the difficulty of dearness by subdividing the cost, and then selling such copies as are still in decent condition at a large reduction. It is this state of things, due, in my opinion, principally to the present form of the law of copyright, which perhaps may have helped {{to make way for the}} satirical (and sometimes untrue) remark that in times of distress or pressure men make their first economies on their charities, and their second on their books.|$|E
