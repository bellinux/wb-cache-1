5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> road, which is atypical for a lake shoreline.

5|$|By 1926, the Kingsland–St. Marys highway was a sand or dirt road. When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 was under construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> road by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was under construction by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was under construction by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941. The gap in Kingsland was placed under construction by April 1941 but was not completed until the beginning of 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants to create <b>a</b> <b>paved,</b> Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The {{total cost of}} paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.|$|E

5|$|K-140's route was {{established}} in 1925 as U.S. Route 40S. By 1936, the route had become the primary route of US-40, with the old US-40N becoming U.S. Route 24. By 1969, after the majority of Interstate 70 had been completed, US-40 was rerouted to be concurrent with the newly constructed highway, and the old route of US-40 between Ellsworth and Salina was resigned as K-140. The routing of K-140 has remained unchanged since. The K-140 route has been <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> road since at least 1932.|$|E

5|$|State Highway 82 {{traverses}} it, in {{the process}} reaching the highest elevation of <b>a</b> <b>paved</b> Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E
