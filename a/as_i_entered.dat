25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t believe my eyes. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been {{so glad to see}} the old girl. And I think she felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
2500|$|The traders of Shanghai offered Gordon {{huge sums}} of money {{to thank him for}} his work {{commanding}} the Ever Victorious Army. Gordon declined all honors of financial gain, writing: [...] "I know I shall leave China as poor <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> it, but with the knowledge that, through my weak instrumentality, upwards of eighty to one thousand lives have been spared. I want no further satisfaction than this". The British journalist Mark Urban wrote: [...] "To those looking at Gordon's actions now, the thanks of companies trading in opium or of a government that killed millions in its suppression of rebellion might seem like the most poisonous endorsements. But at the time people saw a brave man who acted with humanity in an otherwise ghastly conflict, standing out from the other mercenaries, adventurers and cut-throats in wanting almost nothing for himself".|$|E
6000|$|Soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> at {{my country}} door, My mind resumes the thread it dropped before; Thoughts, which at Hyde-park-corner I forgot, Meet, and rejoin me, in the pensive grot, There all alone, and {{compliments}} apart, [...] 210 I ask these sober questions of my heart: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Landlord, I am {{the bearer}} of {{important}} despatches, and {{it is imperative that}} I should not attract attention <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the city. If I were seen and recognized there, questions might be asked, and curiosity excited as to the news of which I am the bearer.|$|R
6000|$|When the {{boy with}} his card had {{disappeared}} into the candy-colored distances, the playwright found himself again studying {{the face of his}} incomprehensible sorceress, who looked down upon him even at that moment from a bulletin-board on the hotel wall, Oriental, savage, and sullen--sad, too, as though alone in her solitary splendor. [...] "She can't be all of her parts--which one of them will <b>I</b> find <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> her room?" [...] he asked himself for the hundredth time.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the {{enclosure}} {{the eyes of}} those in the balcony were full upon me.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> {{the talking}} ceased. I saw no face except his and that seemed blank.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the room, he {{interrupted}} himself {{and spoke to}} me in a harsh, disagreeable voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{hear the}} {{conductor}} calling 'all aboard' <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the depot, my heart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs {{respond to the}} air-waves falling on my tympanum by quickening their movements. If <b>I</b> stumble <b>as</b> <b>I</b> run, the sensation of falling provokes a movement of the hands towards {{the direction of the}} fall, the effect of which is to shield the body from too sudden a shock. If a cinder enter my eye, its lids close forcibly and a copious flow of tears tends to wash it out.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Its pungent stench rips at {{the insides of}} my {{nostrils}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the chamber. Suddenly, it is aware of my presence and falls into a dormant state of stillness, as if to camouflage itself from me. Yet, I know it 2 ̆ 7 s there, and it knows too. It {{is the essence of}} evil, and it is anything but stupid. 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|Gascoyne had, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>entered</b> {{into the}} matter with spirit, and perhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the project caught its {{delightful}} flavor of romance.|$|R
60|$|One of the peons {{recognized}} me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the court, and Altascar met {{me on the}} corridor.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{an uncomfortable}} {{stiffness}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the once familiar sitting-room, {{now in a}} state of wild disorder.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> silence {{fell upon}} the great {{concourse}} {{of people that}} packed the auditorium. Then Tardos Mors arose.|$|E
2500|$|When he was young, the Kojima {{family moved}} to a small city called Shirasaki. His family soon moved to Kawanishi, Hyōgo in the Kansai region. Kojima has noted that growing up he was a {{latchkey}} kid, often having to look after himself {{when he came home}} from school. Staying at home by himself in isolation still affects him to this day stating, [...] " [...] I travel and stay at a hotel I put the TV on <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the room, just to deal with the feeling of loneliness." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Claudia's eyes {{followed}} me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{shut the door}} again and crossed the room to a second door which led into my bed-chamber. She suddenly stepped up to me, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>entering</b> the room, and laid {{her hand on my}} arm.|$|R
60|$|Bel. Thereupon I called {{immediately}} for my sword, {{and came}} in all haste to advertise you; but I see there's no resisting destiny; for just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>entering</b> the garden door, I met the women with their gallants all under sail, and outward bound.|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> and saluted, Lorquas Ptomel {{signaled}} me to advance, and, fixing his great, hideous eyes upon me, addressed me thus: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the Club-room, Kimber {{was making}} the remark: “And he still half-believes him to be very high in the Church.” ...|$|E
60|$|An {{explosion}} of {{laughter from the}} doctor stopped me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> a large library, the powerful lights of which at first dazzled me.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>I</b> was <b>entering</b> high school, {{my mother}} was reading Silent Spring and the dinner table {{conversation}} was about pesticides and the environment [...] The year I graduated from college the momentum was building for Earth Day. After Vietnam, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>entering</b> divinity school, the Club of Rome report came out and the limits to growth was a main issue.|$|R
60|$|She {{was not at}} her work, <b>as</b> usual, when <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> {{her little}} sitting-room. She was {{standing}} by the fire, with her head down and with an open letter in her hand.|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. Then {{as surely}} <b>as</b> you live, <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the coal trade to- morrow. George's taste for amusing company will deliver him into my hands. Before a month passes your home {{will be at}} my mercy.|$|R
60|$|Lady Dennisford had failed. I {{saw it in}} {{her face}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the room, and her first few words {{confirmed}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, sir," [...] {{interrupted}} Mowbray, [...] "one farther question. I {{understand something}} {{was said in}} disparagement of my sister just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the tea-room?" ...|$|E
60|$|A bell tinkled {{over the}} door of the little drug store <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> it; which seemed strange in a lighted street of a great city.|$|E
60|$|So they bent forward, and I whispered awhile of {{the death}} of a king, and the sons of Senzangacona nodded their heads as one man in answer. Then I rose up, and crept from the hut <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>entered</b> it, and rousing certain trusty messengers, I {{dispatched}} them, running swiftly through the night.|$|R
60|$|For indeed I thought not, when I {{began this}} history, {{to tell you}} as much {{concerning}} him <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have done. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>entered</b> into this history I have come so strongly to perceive how noble and true and loyal was the knighthood of Sir Tristram, that I could not forbear telling you of many things that I had not purposed to speak of.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} concern {{ourselves}} about that," [...] she replied. [...] "None dares harm me {{for fear of}} the wrath of O-Tar--otherwise I should have been dead so soon <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> {{this portion of the}} palace, for the women hate me. O-Tar alone may punish me, and what cares O-Tar for the life of a eunuch? No, fear not upon this score." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sprang up}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> and came towards {{me with a}} look of {{pleasure}} on his handsome, high-bred face, that did me good to see.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> {{his room}} he greeted {{me with a}} cheerful smile, and {{although}} evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the {{corridor}} again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron, accosted me, and jerking his thumb {{over his shoulder}} said--"Is that your friend?" ...|$|E
60|$|It took {{slipping}} and elbowing to {{get through}} the crowd. Once inside the door I saw that the crowd was mostly outside, and evidently not so desirous <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was to <b>enter.</b>|$|R
60|$|Only one street {{lies between}} me and the Rue Fossette; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> it, for the first time, the sound of a {{carriage}} tears up the deep peace of this quarter. It comes this way--comes very fast. How loud sounds its rattle on the paved path! The street is narrow, and I keep carefully to the causeway. The carriage thunders past, but what do I see, or fancy <b>I</b> see, <b>as</b> it rushes by? Surely something white fluttered from that window--surely a hand waved a handkerchief. Was that signal meant for me? Am I known? Who could recognise me? That is not M. de Bassompierre's carriage, nor Mrs. Bretton's; and besides, neither the Hôtel Crécy nor the château of La Terrasse lies in that direction. Well, I have no time for conjecture; I must hurry home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some time I {{must come}} {{here in the}} moonlight," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> descended and <b>entered</b> the chilly old church. [...] "Surely I would learn sweet secrets which the sun each day effaces." ...|$|R
