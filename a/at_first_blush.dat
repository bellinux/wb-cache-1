25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E

Even Ludwig von Mises, his disciple, said in his autobiography, Memoirs (1978), that Wieser had misunderstood {{the gist of the}} subjectivism of the Austrian School and was actually a member of the Lausanne School. But in both he also presents a clear methodological individualism and a rejection of historicism of the German school, so <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> it is difficult to justify his exclusion from the Austrian School.|$|E

2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> {{it seemed}} ridiculous that the Knights {{would agree to}} the proposal. The Knights were powerful, FOTLU was weak and the Knights were {{dismantling}} the federation seemingly at will. But the situation was more complex than that. A number of former FOTLU craft unions had affiliated with the Knights, and they formed a powerful and cohesive clique within the labor organization. [...] Additionally, many of these unions had been raided by other labor organizations belonging to the Knights, or had their job actions broken by scab workers belonging to the Knights. [...] These unions were now ready to undercut the Knights in the Philadelphia negotiations. At the same time, some important Knight leaders had quietly approached Grand Master Workman Terence V. Powderly, and convinced him of that many of FOTLU's grievances were justified. Additionally, {{the collapse of the}} Southwest rail strike was putting pressure on Powderly to seek breathing room.|$|E
2500|$|Atwater {{had urged}} the Court {{to adopt a}} [...] "bright-line" [...] rule that the police not arrest anyone for an offense that did not carry jail time unless the {{government}} could show a compelling need to detain the person. [...] <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules {{that are easy to}} apply on the spot. [...] But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. [...] Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to know the details of [...] "frequently complex penalty schemes," [...] especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs. [...] Furthermore, even if the officer could make that distinction on the spot, he could not know how the district attorney will later choose to charge the offense.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect upon}} Swithin of the {{interview}} with the Bishop had been a very marked one. He {{felt that he had}} good ground for resenting that dignitary's tone in haughtily assuming that all must be sinful which <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> appeared to be so, and in narrowly refusing a young man the benefit of a single doubt.

6000|$|But {{they who}} frequented it {{interested}} me much more--as various and animated a gathering as any I have seen. Yet in some peculiar manner they seemed {{one and all}} not to the last tittle quite of this world. They were, so to speak, more earthy, too definite, too true to the mould, like figures in a bleak, bright light viewed out of darkness. Certainly {{not one of them}} was <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> prepossessing. Yet who finds much amiss with the fox at last, though all he seems to have be cunning? ...|$|E

6000|$|It was now quite dark, and we lay whispering, in {{the damp}} hollow under the great stone. Our plan was to crawl away <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of dawn, when men {{generally}} sleep most soundly; that William should enter one of the unguarded houses (for these people never stole, {{and did not know}} {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "thief"), that he should help himself to provisions, and that meanwhile I should have a boat ready to start in the harbour.|$|R

Five minutes more sufficed to finish our toilet (for, be it known, Mr Carles and I had only taken off our coats), tie up our blankets, and embark.

25|$|Their {{first major}} {{engagement}} was the following year, 1854, {{in support of}} British soldiers during the events leading up to, and confrontation at, the Eureka Stockade where some miners (mostly Irish), police and soldiers were killed. From a report at the time: 'the troops and Police were under arms, and just <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of dawn they marched upon the camp at Eureka'. Following the brutality of the police after the stockade, public opinion turned against them, the 13 miners charged with treason were all acquitted and police numbers were dramatically cut.|$|R
60|$|But if we {{expected}} to find Alphonse at a loss and put him to open shame we were destined to be disappointed. He bowed and scraped and smiled, and acknowledged that his conduct might <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> appear strange, but really it was not, inasmuch as his teeth were not chattering from fear -- oh, dear no! oh, certainly not! he marvelled how the 'messieurs' could think {{of such a thing}} -- but from the chill air of the morning. As for the rag, if monsieur could have but tasted its evil flavour, being compounded indeed of a mixture of stale paraffin oil, grease, and gunpowder, monsieur himself would have spat it out. But he did nothing of the sort; he determined to keep it there till, alas! his stomach 'revolted', and the rag was ejected in an access of involuntary sickness.|$|E

60|$|First, All purely IDENTICAL PROPOSITIONS. These {{obviously}} and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> {{appear to}} contain no instruction in them; for when we affirm the said term of itself, {{whether it be}} barely verbal, or whether it contains any clear and real idea, it shows us nothing but what we must certainly know before, whether such a proposition be either made by, or proposed to us. Indeed, that most general one, WHAT IS, IS, may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he is guilty of, when, by circumlocution or equivocal terms, he would in particular instances deny the same thing of itself; because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense, as to affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain words; or, if he does, a man is excused if he breaks off any further discourse with him. But yet I think I may say, that neither that received maxim, nor any other identical proposition, teaches us anything; and though in such kind of propositions this great and magnified maxim, boasted to be the foundation of demonstration, may be and often is made use of to confirm them, yet all it proves amounts {{to no more than}} this, That the same word may with great certainty be affirmed of itself, without any doubt of the truth of any such proposition; and let me add, also, without any real knowledge.|$|E

6000|$|The dull {{stagnant}} world, shaken awake by this Liege adventure, gives voice variously; {{and in the}} Gazetteer and Diplomatic circles it is much criticised, by {{no means}} everywhere in the favorable tone <b>at</b> this <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of the business. [...] "He had written an ANTI-Machiavel," [...] says the Abbe St. Pierre, and even says Voltaire (in the PASQUIL, not the contemporary LETTERS), [...] "and he acts thus!" [...] Truly he does, Monsieur de Voltaire; and all men, with light upon the subject, or even with the reverse upon it, must make their criticisms. For the rest, Borck's [...] "2,000 arguments" [...] are there; which Borck handles well, with polite calm rigor: by degrees the dust will fall, and facts everywhere be seen for what they are.|$|R
60|$|It may be remarked, however, that, of all {{the events}} which {{constitute}} a person's biography, there is scarcely one--none, certainly, of anything like a similar importance--to which the world so easily reconciles itself as to his death. In most other cases and contingencies, the individual is present among us, mixed up with the daily revolution of affairs, and affording a definite point for observation. At his decease, {{there is only a}} vacancy, and a momentary eddy,--very small, as compared with the apparent magnitude of the ingurgitated object,--and a bubble or two, ascending out of the black depth and bursting at the surface. As regarded Judge Pyncheon, it seemed probable, <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> that the mode of his final departure might give him a larger and longer posthumous vogue than ordinarily attends the memory of a distinguished man. But when it came to be understood, on the highest professional authority, that the event was a natural, and--except for some unimportant particulars, denoting a slight idiosyncrasy--by no means an unusual form of death, the public, with its customary alacrity, proceeded to forget that he had ever lived. In short, the honorable Judge was beginning to be a stale subject before half the country newspapers had found time to put their columns in mourning, and publish his exceedingly eulogistic obituary.|$|E
60|$|To some, it {{may raise}} {{a degree of}} {{surprise}} that one so full of confidence, as the merchant has throughout shown himself, up to the moment of his late sudden impulsiveness, should, in that instance, have betrayed such a depth of discontent. He may be thought inconsistent, and even so he is. But for this, is the author to be blamed? True, it may be urged {{that there is nothing}} a writer of fiction should more carefully see to, as there is nothing a sensible reader will more carefully look for, than that, in the depiction of any character, its consistency should be preserved. But this, though <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> seeming reasonable enough, may, upon a closer view, prove not so much so. For how does it couple with another requirement--equally insisted upon, perhaps--that, while to all fiction is allowed some play of invention, yet, fiction based on fact should never be contradictory to it; and is it not a fact, that, in real life, a consistent character is a rara avis? Which being so, the distaste of readers to the contrary sort in books, can hardly arise from any sense of their untrueness. It may rather be from perplexity as to understanding them. But if the acutest sage be often at his wits' ends to understand living character, shall those who are not sages expect to run and read character in those mere phantoms which flit along a page, like shadows along a wall? That fiction, where every character can, by reason of its consistency, be comprehended at a glance, either exhibits but sections of character, making them appear for wholes, or else is very untrue to reality; while, on the other hand, that author who draws a character, even though to common view incongruous in its parts, as the flying-squirrel, and, at different periods, as much at variance with itself as the butterfly is with the caterpillar into which it changes, may yet, in so doing, be not false but faithful to facts.|$|E
6000|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> it {{may seem}} not only unnecessary, but even indecent, to discuss such a {{proposition}} as the elevation of cruelty {{to the rank of}} a human right. Unnecessary, because no vivisector confesses to a love of cruelty for its own sake or claims any general fundamental right to be cruel. Indecent, because there is an accepted convention to repudiate cruelty; and vivisection is only tolerated by the law on condition that, like judicial torture, it shall be done as mercifully as the nature of the practice allows. But the moment the controversy becomes embittered, the recriminations bandied between the opposed parties bring us face-to-face with some very ugly truths. On one occasion I was invited to speak at a large Anti-Vivisection meeting in the Queen's Hall in London. I found myself on the platform with fox hunters, tame stag hunters, men and women whose calendar was divided, not by pay days and quarter days, but by seasons for killing animals for sport: the fox, the hare, the otter, the partridge and the rest having each its appointed date for slaughter. The ladies among us wore hats and cloaks and head-dresses obtained by wholesale massacres, ruthless trappings, callous extermination of our fellow creatures. We insisted on our butchers supplying us with white veal, and were large and constant consumers of pate de foie gras; both comestibles being obtained by revolting methods. We sent our sons to public schools where indecent flogging is a recognized method of taming the young human animal. Yet we were all in hysterics of indignation at the cruelties of the vivisectors. These, if any were present, must have smiled sardonically at such inhuman humanitarians, whose daily habits and fashionable amusements cause more suffering in England in a week than all the vivisectors of Europe do in a year. I made a very effective speech, not exclusively against vivisection, but against cruelty; and I have never been asked to speak since by that Society, nor do I expect to be, as I should probably give such offence to its most affluent subscribers that its attempts to suppress vivisection would be seriously hindered. But that does not prevent the vivisectors from freely using the [...] "youre another" [...] retort, and using it with justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "No." [...] She {{pronounced}} the monosyllable alone, {{and then he}} walked away from her as though that one little word settled the question for him, now and for ever. He walked away from her, perhaps a distance of two hundred yards, as though the interview was over, and he were leaving her. She, as she saw him go, wished that he would return that she might say some word of comfort to him. Not that she could have said the only word that would have comforted him. <b>At</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> of the thing, <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> sound of the address which he had made to her, she had been angry with him. He had disappointed her, and she was indignant. But her anger had already melted and turned itself to ruth.

6000|$|The next day, <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush</b> {{of morning}} light, he was aroused {{with the other}} slaves by Peter the Great, who, he found, was the Moor's {{overseer}} of domestics. He was put to the same work as before, but that day his friend the negro was sent off on a mission that was to detain him several days from home. Another man took Peter's place, but, as he spoke neither English nor French, no communication passed between the overseer and slave except by signs. As, however, the particular job on {{which he had been}} put was simple, this did not matter. During the period of Peter's absence the poor youth felt the oppression of his isolated condition keenly. He sank to a lower condition than before, and when his friend returned, he was surprised to find how much of his happiness depended on the sight of his jovial black face! ...|$|R
60|$|Strange to relate, it was {{not till}} my Viking, with a rueful face, {{reminded}} me of the fact, that I bethought me of a circumstance somewhat alarming <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush.</b> We must push off without chart or quadrant; though, as will shortly be seen, a compass was by no means out of the question. The chart, to be sure, I did not so much lay to heart; but a quadrant was more than desirable. Still, it was by no means indispensable. For this reason. When we started, our latitude would be exactly known; and whether, on our voyage westward, we drifted north or south therefrom, we could not, by any possibility, get so far out of our reckoning, as to fail in striking some one of a long chain of islands, which, for many degrees, {{on both sides of the}} equator, stretched right across our track.|$|R

60|$|The {{word was}} easy to say; the thing, <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>blush,</b> was undiscoverable. I was {{overwhelmed}} with miserable, womanish pity for my broken friend; his outcries grieved my spirit; I saw him then and now--then, so invincible; now, brought so low--and knew neither how to refuse nor how to consent to his proposal. The remembrance of my father, who had fallen in the same field unstained, {{the image of his}} monument incongruously raising a fear of the law, a chill air that seemed to blow upon my fancy from the doors of prisons, and the imaginary clank of fetters, recalled me to a different resolve. And then, again, the wails of my sick partner intervened. So I stood hesitating, and yet with a strong sense of capacity behind, sure, if I could but choose my path, that I should walk in it with resolution.|$|R

It was late April weather when they reached the station at the foot of that high hill where Augusta Perusia sits lording it on her throne over the wedded valleys of the Tiber and the Clitumnus. Tramontana was blowing. No rain had fallen for weeks; the slopes of the lower Apennines, ever dry and dusty, shone still drier and dustier than Alan had yet beheld them. Herminia glanced up at the long white road, thick in deep gray powder, that led by endless zigzags along the dreary slope to the long white town on the shadeless hill-top. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> sight alone, Perugia was a startling disillusion to Herminia.
