5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state <b>as</b> <b>federal</b> disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E

5|$|Governor of Rhode Island Dennis J. Roberts {{declared}} {{martial law}} for the state after Carol caused heavy damage. In Massachusetts, the National Guard were deployed to six towns to prevent looting. National Guardsmen flew a plane of dry ice from Newark, New Jersey to Boston to assist the widespread areas without power and refrigeration. Widespread areas were without power for days, and in some areas {{for up to a}} week, until crews could repair downed lines. Spoiled food due to lack of refrigeration resulted in about $1million in losses. Power crews from elsewhere in the United States arrived to assist in the restoration. Workers quickly removed trees from highways. Damaged factories in Rhode Island prevented employees from working for three weeks after the storm. The steeple of the Old North Church in Boston was rebuilt in 1955, after residents throughout the country provided $150,000 in donations. Governor of Maine Burton M. Cross {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. The Small Business Administration declared six counties in Maine as disaster areas. In the days after the storm, President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower declared Massachusetts and Rhode Island <b>as</b> <b>federal</b> disaster areas. The federal government provided financial aid, amounting to $1.5million in Massachusetts. The president ordered for troops to assist in the aftermath. The American Red Cross quickly deployed teams to the most affected areas, feeding hundreds of families. About 12days after Carol struck New England, Hurricane Edna struck eastern Massachusetts, causing an additional $40million in damage and 20deaths. More disaster aid was provided after the second hurricane.|$|E

The American Red Cross and other voluntary agencies assisted with food and water distribution as well as emergency needs and housing. Subsequently, an additional disaster relief center was opened in Santa Rosa County. Just days after the storm, six additional counties became eligible for federal disaster aid.|$|E
