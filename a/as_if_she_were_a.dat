25|$|Feminist {{critics have}} focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, they point to the common {{classification}} of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> whore also.|$|E
25|$|The {{method by}} which Cybersix obtains {{sustenance}} is different among the series' incarnations. In the comic book, Cybersix sucks sustenance directly from the neck of those she hunts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> vampire; however, {{she does not have}} fangs, instead simply making a wound in the victim's neck with her teeth, then drinking the Sustenance that bleeds from it instead of blood. Conversely, in the animated series, Von Reichter's creations carry glowing vials of Sustenance with them, which Cybersix would open and drink.|$|E
25|$|Zoey (Miles?): A baby {{orangutan}} who {{was brought}} into the Miles' family after being rejected by her mother. Zoey is very playful and curious, which is the biggest reason she gets into tight, and sometimes near fatal, situations. Having an aggravating tendency to rip things apart (mainly Molly's homework), throw food around, and trash anything she comes across, {{she has to be}} carefully monitored <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> human toddler. She once swallowed an entire bottle of shampoo and became seriously dehydrated, which caused Molly to rush her to a hospital in order to keep her from dying. This act has probably led to Zoey bonding strongly with Molly and learning the most from her.|$|E

25|$|After graduation, {{she spent}} some time in France. Returning to California, Swett became a teacher in the {{kindergarten}} schools of San Francisco. It was in 1879, when the second Free Kindergarten west of the Rocky Mountains was organized, at 116 Jackson Street, that Swett, then an earnest, enthusiastic student, became deeply interested in the needy, neglected children of the Barbary Coast, that had been grouped for training and improvement. It was not long until a Second Class was organized in the same building, from the overflow of Class No.1. In the absence of a trained Kindergartner, and while waiting to secure the same, Swett took the work in hand, and day after day, was as faithful at her post <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> paid teacher of the Association.|$|E
25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E
500|$|Collings, heir {{presumptive}} to Sark, was treated {{by her father}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> boy. She was lame due to unequal leg length, {{but that did not}} prevent him from insisting on teaching her to shoot, sail, and climb cliffs. He never allowed his daughters to complain of pain or sadness, and his successor was later grateful for [...] "being able to live a life free of the inconvenience of self-pity". As the future ruler of an island situated between France and the United Kingdom, she learned standard French and the local Sercquiais dialect of the Norman language.|$|E

500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E
500|$|Since February 2006, Lindesfarne has {{had her own}} blog titled [...] "Virtual Quill". Originally, she was posting it as a sort {{of private}} journal, using the inter{{dimension}}al portal to make sure that if it were ever seen by others, it would only be seen by humans from her native dimension (namely, our world), not the dimension she's called home {{for the vast majority of}} her life. She would post generally once a week, talking about the various events in her life and those of her friends and family, providing additional information and insights into what was shown on the strip. Many fans commented back to her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> real person, but she couldn’t see those comments at first because her interdimensional Internet connection was one-way (write-only).|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on the Oprah Winfrey {{show and}} received a standing ovation from her cast members, the audience, and left Oprah speechless. Upon the song's completion, Oprah simply exclaimed, [...] "Wow." [...] The second performance was at the 49th Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center, in Los Angeles, California, on February 11, 2007. MTV News' staff members coined it as the Best Oscar Performance, writing: [...] "Beyoncé killed it with a passionate performance of 'Listen'." [...] Beyoncé later performed [...] "Listen" [...] with Alexandra Burke on December 16, 2008, at the final of The X Factor, with Burke having performed the song alone two weeks previously. Burke battled to control her emotions when Beyoncé joined her on stage and dissolved into tears when their duet was over. Burke {{went on to win}} the competition later that night. Barbara Ellen of The Observer praised Beyoncé's performance of the song saying that [...] "there seemed something a little overpowering, invulnerable, dare I say, ungenerous, about Beyoncé - almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> giant slithering diva/snake hell bent on swallowing poor quivering Burke whole." ...|$|E

500|$|Elliot Barker, {{the head}} of Oak Ridge's {{therapeutic}} division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more {{of their time in}} each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. [...] "My original vision," [...] he writes, [...] "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community." [...] Barker's [...] "Social Therapy Unit" [...] (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail, volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were [...] "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the autobiography, the {{principal}} aid she received {{at this stage}} of her life was from other actors. Dressing as a man could of course be explained as one way to avoid being recognised by her many creditors, but it was also clearly Charke's preference. [...] While trying to raise money from friends, she was arrested for debt and imprisoned. [...] According to her in an intriguiging passage of her Autobiography, it was the coffee-house keepers and prostitutes of Covent Garden who banded together to raise the money for her bail, and these women, knowing her well, jokingly referred to her as [...] "Master Charles" [...] <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> young gentleman.|$|E

2500|$|There was no overt sexual {{connotation}} in Butler's order, but {{its effect}} was to revoke the protected status held by women under the social mores of the time, which mandated that any [...] "respectable" [...] woman (i.e., a non-prostitute) {{be treated with}} the extra degree of respect due a lady, regardless of their own provocations. Under General Order 28, however, if a woman showed any form of insult or contempt towards a Union soldier (even so much as turning her back when he approached or refusing to answer his questions), the usual social standards no longer applied, and she could be retaliated against (either verbally or physically) <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> common prostitute. The order produced the desired effect, as few women proved willing to risk retaliation simply to protest the Union presence; but it was seen as extremely draconian by everyone except the Union soldiers in New Orleans, and provoked general outrage in both the North and the South, as well as abroad, particularly in England and France.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{reviews of}} the time made much of {{the manner in which}} each {{production}} approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; [...] "At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry." [...] Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers Élisabéthains, said of the scene, [...] "audience members turned their heads away in real distress." [...] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia [...] "almost too ghastly to behold." [...] Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage [...] "chills the blood." [...] Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; [...] "violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war." [...] Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked [...] "is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?" [...] Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote [...] "At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence." [...] Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers Élisabéthains, for example, wrote [...] "Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic." [...] Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote [...] "Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror." [...] Ninagawa himself said [...] ""The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production." [...] In her 2013 essay, [...] "Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agnès Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a [...] "visual emblem"; [...] "Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance [...] Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to [...] "dissonance," [...] the production presents Lavinia onstage <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> painting [...] Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood [...] are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it." ...|$|E
