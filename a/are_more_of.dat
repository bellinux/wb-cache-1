25|$|Characters U+0800 through U+FFFF use three bytes in UTF-8, {{but only}} two in UTF-16.

25|$|In some cases, the {{peroxides}} can spontaneously precipitate as concentrated crystalline solids {{within a}} storage container for ether.

Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a problem in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle.

25|$|The {{number of}} Arab dirhams {{discovered}} {{on the island}} of Gotland alone is astoundingly high. In the various hoards located around the island, there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> these silver coins than at any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum is almost as great as the number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim world. These coins moved north through trade between Rus merchants and the Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver-Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian merchants would help northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} texts have Berrice today, {{as well as}} Bergos for Vergos in {{the same}} list of islands. The Scandiae islands <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a problem, {{as they could be}} Scandinavia, but other islands had that name as well. Moreover, Procopius says that the earlier name of Scandinavia was Thule and that it was the home of the Goths. The fact that Pytheas returned from the vicinity of the Baltic favors Procopius's view. The fact that Pytheas lived centuries before the colonization of Iceland and Greenland by European agriculturalists makes them less likely candidates, as Thule was populated and its soil was tilled.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequent}} midwinter thaws in Great Plains Chinook country <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a bane than {{a blessing}} to gardeners. Plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent Chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if {{they appear to be}} remaining dormant. In either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves. Many plants which do well at Winnipeg (where constant cold maintains dormancy all winter) are difficult to grow in the Alberta Chinook belt; examples include basswood, some apple, raspberry and Saskatoon varieties, and Amur maples. Trees in the Chinook-affected areas of Alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than trees in areas not affected by Chinooks. This is once again caused by the ‘off-and-on’ dormancy throughout winter.|$|E

25|$|The Catskill Mountains <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a {{dissected}} plateau than {{a series}} of mountain ranges. The sediments {{that make up the}} rocks in the Catskills were deposited when the ancient Acadian Mountains in the east were rising and subsequently eroding. The sediments traveled westward and formed a great delta into the sea that was in the area at that time. The escarpment of the Catskill Mountains is near the former (landward) edge of this delta, as the sediments deposited in the northeastern areas along the escarpment were deposited above sea level by moving rivers, and the Acadian Mountains were located roughly where the Taconic Mountains are located today (though significantly larger). Finer sediment was deposited further westward, and thus the rocks change from gravel conglomerates to sandstone and shale. Further west, these fresh water deposits intermingle with shallow marine sandstone and shale until the end, in deeper water limestone.|$|E

Key {{has in the past}} noted others' concern at the pace of asset sales, but argued that the arguments against selling assets in the 1980s were largely irrational. In a 2002 interview, he stated that [...] "some form of orientation towards privatisation" [...] in health, education and superannuation, such as giving firms tax breaks for employer super schemes, made sense. After his party won a plurality in the 2011 election, Key rejected claims that the National Government lacks a mandate to partially privatise state-owned assets.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson was {{familiar}} {{not only with}} the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature.

Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyres influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him [...] "Carlo" [...] after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, [...] "Why clasp any hand but this?"
