5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against opposing forces. However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' that shows the motions <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> of the officers. A gallery of character artworks and game movies is also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E

50|$|Begun in 2000, {{the band}} was known as Mumrah until 2006. The {{original}} members were Iain MacKenzie (rhythm guitar), Jimb (guitar), Chuckles the Clown (drums <b>and</b> <b>voice),</b> Greg Cruse (bass) <b>and</b> DJ Implant (<b>voice</b> <b>and</b> turntables). This incarnation was short-lived and Implant and Cruse left the band; Iain MacFrenzy assumed the position of lead vocalist and Nixo (bass) became a full-time member. The band expanded to include Mickey Bones (trombone, <b>voice)</b> <b>and</b> Tiny Tommy Toot-Fruit (Arif Driessen, trumpet <b>and</b> <b>voice,</b> now of UK/US ambient rock band *Shels). Toot Fruit left the band in 2008 {{to be replaced by}} T-Cass (trumpet, voice). The line-up at that time consisted of Iain MacFrenzy (rhythm guitar <b>and</b> <b>voice),</b> Chuckles The Clown (drums <b>and</b> <b>voice),</b> Jimb (lead guitar <b>and</b> <b>voice),</b> Oz (bass guitar <b>and</b> <b>voice),</b> Mickey Bones (trombone <b>and</b> <b>voice)</b> <b>and</b> T-Cass (trumpet <b>and</b> <b>voice).</b> This personnel recorded the album, Drones, in mid-2008 which was released on the Genin label - home of Djevara, Elephant Vs Leopard, Thumpermonkey, Claypigeon, Frowser and Pigshakle - on 1 February 2010.|$|R

5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral {{cats and}} black rat (Rattus rattus).

Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds.

5|$|Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy film {{produced}} by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon, {{it is the}} sequel to 1995's Toy Story. In the film, Woody is stolen by a toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted {{by the idea of}} immortality in a museum. Many of the original characters <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> from Toy Story return for this sequel, and several new characters—including Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson), Stinky Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Estelle Harris)—are introduced.|$|E

5|$|In 1973-1982 {{restoration}} of the Refectory Church of St. John the Theologian (the only building that survived the demolition of the 1930s) was held. Authors of the project - architect V. Shevchenko and architect I. Karakis (interiors and furniture). After Ukraine regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> started to be heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as {{an important part of}} the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997–1998, whereupon the cathedral and belltower were transferred to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt.|$|E

Superb fairywrens may utilise a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala) recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners {{did not respond to}} miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and white-tailed kites. The nests may be raided by {{a range of}} species {{including}} mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation {{has not yet been}} directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush. Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> a continuous alarm call. In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator. The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the tumbling off the bush display.|$|E

5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces <b>and</b> <b>voices.</b> An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
5|$|Viswanathan (T. S. Balaiah) is an arrogant, money-minded {{estate owner}} {{who lives in}} a {{bungalow}} called Chinnamalai Estate near Pollachi. His son Chellappa (Nagesh) is an aspiring filmmaker; Chellappa is the antithesis of his father <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> his displeasure at his father's arrogance. Viswanathan also has two daughters; Kanchana (Kanchana) and Nirmala (Rajasree). Kanchana is in love with her college mate Vasu (R. Muthuraman), the son of a rich Chennai-based businessman Sachidanandam (V. S. Raghavan). The sisters return home after completing their education in Chennai. One day while out sightseeing, a battered car driven by their father's young, rebellious estate manager Ashok (Ravichandran) bumps into their car. The sisters quarrel with Ashok and are annoyed by his insolence. At their home, they force Viswanathan to dismiss Ashok. Infuriated, Ashok pitches a tent overlooking their bungalow and begins a strike to get his job back. Nirmala accidentally drops a bucket of water on Ashok's head, hurting him. Feeling guilty, she visits Ashok's tent to apologise and they fall in love.|$|E

25|$|Females show a {{stronger}} McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender {{is the issue}} of male faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> as stimuli in comparison to female faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> as stimuli. Although, there is no difference in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.|$|E
