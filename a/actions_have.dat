50|$|The {{complete}} {{aspect of}} a verb indicates the <b>action</b> <b>has</b> been completed. The progressive {{aspect of a}} verb indicates the <b>action</b> <b>has</b> been started but not been completed or that the action is habitual or a universal fact. The contemplative aspect of a verb indicates that the <b>action</b> <b>has</b> not happened but is anticipated. Some verbs take a fourth aspect known as the recently complete aspect which indicates that the <b>action</b> <b>has</b> just been completed before the time of speaking or before a specified time.|$|R

5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 {{they were used to}} scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to destroy them. These <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> been viewed by historians as one of few instances where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain too difficult for conventional units.|$|E

When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which the}} karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|Between September and November 1917, I Anzac Corps {{took part}} in a number of actions around Ypres in Belgium as the Allies {{launched}} a campaign in order to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau in Belgium.

Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> reminded her of why she loved him.|$|E

5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> given his life a new purpose.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{is leading}} the Spartan army in a rampage across Greece. During the campaign, he is {{attacked}} {{by a number of}} beasts led by Argos, who was sent by the gods to stop Kratos. After a series of skirmishes, Argos is killed by an unknown assassin, who frames Kratos in an attempt to turn the gods against him. The Spartan pursues his foe across Greece to discover the identity of the assassin, but is slowed by constant attacks from the minions of Hades, the God of the Underworld. Zeus sends Ceryx to deliver a message to Kratos: stop the relentless pursuit and take heed of the destruction already caused. Kratos, however, battles and kills Ceryx, which inadvertently allows the assassin to escape. Kratos then realizes his <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> further alienated the gods, and Zeus will soon act in response to his defiance.|$|E
5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas—the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her <b>actions</b> <b>have</b> caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
