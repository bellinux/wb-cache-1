25|$|The 2007 season saw {{a dip in}} {{form for}} Compton scoring less than 400 runs in {{first-class}} cricket with just three fifties, including featuring for the MCC against County Champions Sussex. Although his one-day form improved with his first List A century in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy against Sussex in June 2007, scoring 110 not out. During the 2008 season Compton only played five first-class matches scoring just 68 runs {{at an average of}} 8.50, thus the 2009 season was a marked improvement top scoring in first-class cricket for Middlesex with 860 runs including two centuries and three half-centuries. In one-day cricket Compton was in fine form with three centuries and 694 runs at an average of 77.11, and a highest score of 131 against Kent. Compton rejected an improved two-year contract with Middlesex acting on a verbal agreement with Angus Fraser, Middlesex's managing director of cricket, when he signed a new contract a year <b>ago,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be free to move on if he wished {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|There, Leo is {{revealed}} as {{a son of}} Hephaestus, Piper as a daughter of Aphrodite and Jason as a son of Jupiter, though Hera tells him he is her champion. In the Aphrodite cabin, Piper is horrified {{to discover that the}} head councilor, Drew, is abusing her position as well as the rare gift of charmspeaking (which Piper also possesses) {{to take advantage of the}} other Aphrodite campers. In the Hephaestus cabin, it {{is revealed}} that Leo has the rare ability to conjure fire (a power that has not been seen for centuries), but does not use nor tell anyone about it out of guilt about his mother's death seven years prior. Meanwhile, Jason finds out about his sister Thalia Grace, a demigod daughter of Zeus and a Hunter of Artemis. Shortly thereafter, the three are given a quest to rescue Hera from danger. In the woods, Leo discovers a mechanical bronze dragon (made by the Hephaestus campers long <b>ago)</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> names Festus (Happy) and starts to repair him. After encountering Boreas, Piper, Jason, and Leo soon discover that their enemies are working under orders from Gaea, the Greek primordial goddess of the Earth, to overthrow the gods. Throughout their journey, they run into three Cyclopes, Medea, Midas, and Lycaon and eventually manage to save Coach Hedge. Thalia and Jason meet each other for the first time since Jason was captured by Hera when he was an infant.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Forson {{revealed}} that Mockingbird was secretly working for Forson years <b>ago,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> used Mockingbird to [...] "get Victorius {{out of the}} way" [...] so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could take over the Cult of Entropy.|$|R
60|$|Ah, poor Mrs. White! A sad, sad story! It {{is better}} for poor White that that little churchyard by the sea {{received}} his ashes a while <b>ago,</b> than <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have lived to this time.|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD (decorously subduing his voice). Yes: he did {{not live}} long: indeed, he never came back to England. It must be nearly thirty years <b>ago</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in the West Indies on his {{property}} there.|$|R
500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted a couple of days <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over {{the next two or three}} years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E
2500|$|British {{interpreter}} Hugh Lunghi recounted {{an embarrassing}} episode which {{occurred during the}} Potsdam Conference, when Mountbatten, desiring to receive an invitation to visit the Soviet Union, repeatedly attempted to impress Josef Stalin with his former connections to the Russian imperial family. The attempt fell predictably flat, with Stalin dryly inquiring whether [...] "it was some time <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been there." [...] Says Lunghi, [...] "The meeting was embarrassing because Stalin was so unimpressed. He offered no invitation. Mountbatten left with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 Lange {{announced}} {{in a brief}} press statement on 10 November that he was separating from his wife of 21 years. On 12 November Naomi Lange named his speech-writer, Margaret Pope as the other woman in a Sunday Times article, {{and said that she}} had been told by David five or six months <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> planned to leave the marriage. Lange's mother Phoebe also publicly criticised him, but they later reconciled. He had three children, Roy, Emily, and Byron ( [...] in their 30s) with his first wife (Naomi) and one daughter, Edith, with his second wife (Margaret). He married Margaret in Glasgow on 12 January 1992 while holidaying in Britain.|$|E

I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that {{the truth of what}} rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said. If that is {{entertainment}} to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to— and go there. He could never stand being bored. But there must be Football too— and Peacocks..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 69.
