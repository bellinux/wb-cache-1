2500|$|TVA {{spokesman}} Gil Francis Jr. {{said that}} the TVA was [...] "taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident." [...] In response to a video that showed dead fish on the Clinch River, which had received runoff from the spill, he stated [...] "in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic."

2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened so he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, he visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation. Lauren Abramson, <b>an</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> firm, said she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by Ferguson. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I {{did not want to be}} alone with him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E
60|$|Things were {{ordering}} themselves thus in Plumstead drawing-room when Dr. and Mrs. Grantly were disturbed {{in their}} sweet discourse by the quick rattle of a carriage and pair of horses {{on the gravel}} sweep.

Guests invited to stay a week, and who were conscious of arriving after the first dinner-bell, would probably approach in such a manner.
