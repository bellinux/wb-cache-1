25|$|Thrust was {{provided}} {{by a pair of}} 30kN <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. These were directly mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing. Each engine drove a 6-kW generator for the 28-V onboard electronics, as well as a hydraulic pump and a bleed air system for cabin pressurization. The wing itself was typically empty, fuel was contained within two internally-support self-sealing fuel tanks and an additional lace-support bag held within the upper fuselage. The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used to start the engine. An improvised method of starting the engine using compressed air was heavily discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators successfully operated the Canberra's engines in such a manner, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of sheared equilibrium flows on the $m = 1, n = 1 $ resistive internal kink mode {{in the framework of}} a reduced magnetohydrodynamic model in a periodic cylindrical geometry. Our numerical studies show that there is a significant change of the scaling dependence of the mode growth rate on the Lundquist number in the presence of <b>axial</b> <b>flows</b> compared to the no flow case. Poloidal flows do not influence the scaling. We have further found that viscosity strongly modifies the effect of flows on the (1, 1) mode both in the linear and nonlinear regime. <b>Axial</b> <b>flows</b> increase the linear growth rate for low viscosity values, but they decrease the linear growth rate for higher viscosity values. In the case of poloidal flows the linear growth rate decreases in all cases. Additionally at higher viscosity, we have found strong symmetry breaking in the behaviour of linear growth rates and in the nonlinear saturation levels of the modes {{as a function of the}} helicities of the <b>flows.</b> For <b>axial,</b> poloidal and most helical flow cases, there is flow induced stabilisation of the nonlinear saturation level in the high viscosity regime and destabilisation in the low viscosity regime...|$|R

An approximate method for obtaining the local skin friction on arbitrary slender bodies of revolution in <b>axial</b> incompressible <b>flow</b> has been developed. A comparison of the approximate results with the exact solutions for paraboloids of revolution and circular cylinders shows good agreement. The existence of energy integrals of the modified compressible boundary layer equations is established.

An approximate method for obtaining the local skin friction on arbitrary slender insulated bodies of revolution in <b>axial</b> compressible <b>flow</b> has been developed. The results show that compressibility counterbalances the rise in local skin friction due to curvature at high Reynolds numbers (based on a characteristic length of the body) and increases the local skin friction at sufficiently low Reynolds numbers.

[...] University of Washington, 2001 The Star Thrust Experiment (STX) {{has formed}} and {{sustained}} the Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) with a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) operated at a strength of 25 G and a frequency of 350 kHz. The RMF was generated with two IGBT switched {{solid state power}} supplies capable of delivering 2 MW each. Plasmas were typically 2 m long by 0. 2 m in radius and consisted of fully ionized deuterium at temperatures of 60 eV and peak densities of 5 x 1018 m- 3. The primary diagnostic was an extremely small 24 channel berylia jacketed internal magnetic probe {{that was used to}} make measurements as a function of time, radius, and axial position. These measurements when combined with the FRC's unique geometry and equilibrium relationships determined many other important plasma parameters. Axial confining fields of 100 G maintained a true vacuum boundary around the plasma and allowed for the study of FRC RMF equilibrium interactions. Key findings are that the RMF maintained a near zero separatrix pressure, penetrated only partially, and drove strong radial and <b>axial</b> <b>flows.</b> Issues discussed include the importance of the RMF driving an axial current distribution consistent with that of the FRC, possible benefits of varying the average beta condition, and potential RMF antenna length limits set by the tendency of driven <b>axial</b> <b>flows</b> to screen the RMF from the plasma...|$|R
