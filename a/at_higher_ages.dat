30|$|The {{estimation}} of life expectancy requires the {{estimation of}} death rates beyond the age sample. By design, the LC model cannot be used to estimate death rates outside of the age sample. A potential {{solution to this problem}} is to use a parametric mortality model, such as the Kannisto law model (Kannisto 1996), and to combine it with the LC estimations of death rates (Ševčíková et al. 2016; Antonio et al. 2017; Bohk-Ewald et al. 2017). When using the CoDe 2.1 model, we do not encounter this problem because the estimates of the death probabilities <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>ages</b> stem from Eqs. 1 and 2. Moreover, in the CoDe 2.1 model, the death probabilities level off <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>ages</b> and asymptotically approach the value of parameter g.

We construct life cycle profiles of health for birth year/gender/income groups from the health surveys (based on 128, 689 observations) and exploit the registries to obtain precise estimates of individual probabilities of mortality and institutionalization using a seven year observation period for 2, 521, 122 individuals. We generate selection corrected health profiles using an inverse probability weighting procedure and find that attrition is indeed not random: older, poorer and unhealthier individuals are significantly more likely not to survive the next year and to be admitted to an institution. While these selection effects are very significant, they are not very large. We therefore reject the hypothesis that selective dropout is an important determinant of the differential health trajectories by income over the life course in the Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The western {{population}} is ageing. It is unknown whether age at diagnosis affects {{the severity of}} Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), we therefore performed the present study. Method: 1, 875 RA-patients (7, 219 radiographs) included in five European and North-American cohorts (Leiden-EAC, Wichita, Umea, Groningen and Lund) were studied on associations between age at diagnosis and joint damage severity. In 698 Leiden RA-patients with 7 -years follow-up it was explored if symptom duration, anti-citrullinated-peptide-antibodies (ACPA), swollen joint count (SJC) and C-reactive-protein (CRP) mediated the association of age with joint damage. Fifty-six other RA-patients of the EAC-cohort underwent baseline MRIs of wrist, MCP and MTP-joints; MRI-inflammation (RAMRIS-synovitis plus bone marrow edema) was also evaluated in mediation analyses. Linear regression and multivariate normal regression models were used. Results: Analysis on the five cohorts and the Leiden-EAC separately revealed 1. 026 -fold and 1. 034 -fold increase of radiographic joint damage per year increase in age (beta= 1. 026, 1. 034, both p Conclusion: RA-patients presenting <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>age</b> have more severe joint damage; this might be partially explained by more severe MRI-detected inflammation <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>age...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to report the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a representative sample of Portuguese youth. Methods. This was a school-based study performed in Portugal. A total of 22 048 children and adolescents aged 10 – 18 years were included in the study. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-offs were used to categorise overweight and obese participants. Results. Using IOTF cut-offs the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 17. 0 and 4. 6 % in girls, and 17. 7 and 5. 8 % in boys, respectively (p 0. 001 for overweight and p 0. 05 for obesity), whereas WHO cut-offs resulted in overweight and obesity prevalence scores of 23. 1 and 9. 6 % in girls, and 20. 4 and 10. 3 % in boys, respectively (p 0. 001 for overweight and p 0. 05 for obesity).

40|$|This Paper {{considers}} empirical work {{relating to}} models of firm dynamics. It is {{shown that a}} hazard regression model for firm exits, with a modification to accommodate age-varying covariate effects, provides an adequate framework accommodating many {{of the features of}} interest in empirical studies on firm dynamics. Modelling implications of some of the popular theoretical models are considered and a set of empirical procedures for verifying theoretical implications of the models are proposed. The proposed hazard regression models can accommodate negative effects of initial size that increase to zero with age (active learning model), negative initial size effects that may increase with age, but stay permanently negative (passive learning model), conditional and unconditional hazard rates that decrease with age <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>ages,</b> and adverse effects of macroeconomic shocks that decrease with age of the firm. The methods are illustrated using data on quoted UK firms. Consistent with the active learning model, the effect of initial size is significantly negative for a young firm and falls to zero with age. The hazard function conditional on size, other firm and industry-level characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions decreases with age only <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>ages,</b> but shows the weaker property of Increasing Mean Residual Life over its entire life-duration. Instability in exchange rates affects survival of very young firms strongly, and the effect decreases to insignificant levels for older firms.
