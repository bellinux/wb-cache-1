40|$|The {{seismicity}} in {{the southern}} Kurile Islands arc {{is characterized by a}} complex overlapping of <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> of a few great and many large earthquakes (Ms [greater, double equals] 7. 0). The spatial relationships of these <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> can be explained in terms of a simple pattern of fault plane heterogeneity. The four largest earthquakes in this region are, from north to south, the 1963 Kurile Islands (Mw = 8. 5), the 1958 Etorofu (Mw = 8. 3), the 1969 Kurile Islands (Mw = 8. 2) and the 1973 Nemuro-Oki (Mw = 7. 8) events. Detailed body wave studies indicate that the moment release associated with each event is concentrated in {{a small portion of the}} aftershock area, with scale lengths Ms [greater, double equals] 7. 0) earthquakes both before and after the great events. The second mode involves either rupture of relatively weak regions which results in low-stress-drop events, or rupture of smaller asperities. The earthquakes produced by failure of small asperities tend to repeatedly rupture the same regions, and they have impulsive source time functions indicating rupture of highly stressed regions of the fault surface. By analysis of all Ms [greater, double equals] 7. 0 events since 1946 in this region we find a segmentation of the southern Kurile Islands thrust zone into strongly coupled regions with two scale lengths (dominant and secondary asperities) and weakly coupled regions (the surrounding areas generating the low-stress-drop events). The largest earthquakes and the smaller asperity earthquakes occur at the down-dip portion of the lithospheric interface, while the low-stress-drop events occur much closer to the trench axis. This implies a difference in the degree of mechanical coupling between the subducting and overriding plates, with the deeper portions having greater strength than the shallower parts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> for large earthquakes (scalar seismic moment M 1019. 5 N m, moment magnitude, m 7). Mainshocks are selected from the Harvard centroid moment tensor catalog, and aftershocks are selected from the Preliminary Determination of Epicenters (NEIC) catalog. The af-tershock epicenter maps are approximated by a two-dimensional Gaussian distribu-tion; the major ellipse axis is taken as a quantitative measure of the mainshock focal zone size. The dependence of zone length, l, on earthquake size is studied for three representative focal mechanisms: thrust, normal, and strike slip. Although the num-bers of mainshocks available for analysis are limited (maximum a few tens of events in each case), all earthquakes show the same scaling (M l 3). No observable scaling break or saturation occurs for the largest earthquakes (M 1021 N m, m 8). There-fore, it seems that earthquake geometrical focal zone parameters are self-similar...|$|R

30|$|We {{introduced}} so far our stress-based {{model and}} then showed forecast examples for M ≥ 5 earthquakes in 2009. Since our forecasts were recently submitted or {{are to be}} submitted to the CSEP Japan test center, rigorous testing is out of our scope here. Therefore we do not evaluate our approach modified for the CSEP test. However we show that our approach has several advantages—also pointed out by previous papers discussing the rate/state stress transfer (Toda and Stein, 2003; Catalli et al., 2008; Toda et al., 2005; Cocco et al., 2010)—relative to other statistical earthquake clustering models, such as the Omori-Utsu (Omori, 1894; Utsu, 1961), ETAS (Ogata, 1988) and STEP (Gerstenberger et al., 2004) models. Firstly, off-fault <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> can be well simulated using rectangular finite fault sources rather than point sources. Secondly, areal patterns of triggered seismicity are also influenced by the regional dominant mechanisms of the potential earthquake sources (‘receiver faults’ in Fig. 4). Thirdly, imparted stresses associated with large earthquakes produce stress shadows that lead to a reduction of forecasted earthquakes. This may explain the general seismic quiescence, which the other cluster models cannot reproduce.|$|R
30|$|S. Toda and B. Enescu (2011) {{submitted}} a Coulomb stress transfer model, incorporating a rate- and state-dependent friction law, to the 1 - and 3 -year classes {{as applied to}} the “Mainland” region. Their forecast rates are based on using data on large earthquakes during the past 120 years. Toda and Enescu’s model differs from other statistical earthquake clustering models as follows: (1) off-fault <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> can be modeled {{not just as a}} set of point sources but also as a set of finite, fault-shaped zones; (2) spatial distribution patterns of seismicity to be triggered by Coulomb stresses are determined by taking account of the most likely source mechanisms of future earthquakes; (3) stresses imparted by large earthquakes create stress shadows where smaller numbers of earthquakes are predicted to occur. Although the model has its own weaknesses, such as a number of uncertainty factors and unknown parameters, it is the first physics-based model ever participating in the CSEP. With modifications, this model {{has the potential to be}} used for short-term forecasting, possibly even quasi-real-time off-fault aftershock forecasting in the immediate aftermath of a large earthquake.|$|R
30|$|Numerous studies {{retrospectively}} {{found that}} seismicity rate jumps (drops) by coseismic Coulomb stress increase (decrease). The Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Prediction (CSEP) instead provides {{us an opportunity}} for prospective testing of the Coulomb hypothesis. Here we adapt our stress transfer model incorporating rate and state dependent friction law to the CSEP Japan seismicity forecast. We demonstrate how to compute the forecast rates of large shocks in 2009 using the large earthquakes during the past 120 years. The time dependent impact of the coseismic stress perturbations explains qualitatively well the occurrence of the recent moderate size shocks. Such ability is partly {{similar to that of}} statistical earthquake clustering models. However, our model differs from them as follows: the off-fault <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> can be simulated using finite fault sources; the regional areal patterns of triggered seismicity are modified by the dominant mechanisms of the potential sources; the imparted stresses due to large earthquakes produce stress shadows that lead to a reduction of the forecasted number of earthquakes. Although the model relies on several unknown parameters, it is the first physics based model submitted to the CSEP Japan test center and {{has the potential to be}} tuned for short-term earthquake forecasts.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the shock}} {{occurred}} before the World Wide Standardised Seismological Network was in operation, few instruments captured the event, and its mechanism is not understood {{well as a}} result. Some effort was made with the limited data to {{gain an understanding of}} the rupture area and the distribution of slip.

5000|$|As an example, {{following}} a June 14, 2010 M 5.7 earthquake the CEPEC issued the following statement.

This earthquake occurred at {{the northern end of}} the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zone</b> in an area where there has been considerable activity during the past 10 weeks. The Mw 5.7 earthquake rapidly was followed by a tight cluster of over 30 smaller earthquakes, about 20 of which were in the range of Mw 3.0 to 4.5.|$|E
40|$|We {{determine}} the aftershock areas from relocated hypocentres for 64 dip-slip and eight strike-slip earthquakes {{in the period}} 1977 - 1996 together with those for three recent earthquakes, the 1998 Antarctic plate earthquake, the 1999 Izmit, Turkey earthquake and the 2000 Wharton Basin earthquake. We also include the data for 27 strike-slip earthquakes from Pegler and Das (1996). We find that {{the location of the}} hypocentre is essentially random along strike for both strike-slip and dip-slip earthquakes. Subduction zone earthquakes appear to initiate more frequently towards the down-dip edge of the fault, whereas the non-subduction zone dip-slip earthquakes do not have any preferred depth of initiation. The <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> of subduction zone earthquakes often expand substantially along strike and up dip but far less in the down-dip direction, whereas those for non-subduction zone earthquakes do not expand significantly in either the up- or the down-dip direction. Subduction zone thrust earthquakes have larger and more numerous aftershocks than earthquakes in all other tectonic settings. For strike-slip earthquakes, we find that slip increases at least linearly with length. For dip-slip earthquakes, we find that the ratio of length to width increases systematically with length for lengths > 40 km, indicating that there is some restriction on fault width; slip is found to be proportional to length over the moment range 1017 N m < M 0 < 3 × 1021 N m, taking our data in conjunction with the data of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) ...|$|R
40|$|We invoke a metric to {{quantify}} the correlation between any two earthquakes. This provides a simple and straightforward alternative to using space-time windows to detect aftershock sequences and obviates the need to distinguish main shocks from aftershocks. Directed networks of earthquakes are constructed by placing a link, directed from the past to the future, between pairs of events that are strongly correlated. Each link has a weight giving the relative strength of correlation such that the sum over the incoming links to any node equals unity for aftershocks, or zero if the event had no correlated predecessors. A correlation threshold is set to drastically {{reduce the size of}} the data set without losing significant information. Events can be aftershocks of many previous events, and also generate many aftershocks. The probability distribution for the number of incoming and outgoing links are both scale free, and the networks are highly clustered. The Omori law holds for aftershock rates up to a decorrelation time that scales with the magnitude, m, of the initiating shock as t cutoff ~ 10 β m with β~- 3 / 4. Another scaling law relates distances between earthquakes and their aftershocks to the magnitude of the initiating shock. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of finite <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones.</b> We also find evidence that seismicity is dominantly triggered by small earthquakes. Our approach, using concepts from the modern theory of complex networks, together with a metric to estimate correlations, opens up new avenues of research, as well as new tools to understand seismicity...|$|R
40|$|On 26 December 2004 and 28 March 2005 {{two large}} {{earthquakes}} occurred between the Indo-Australian and the southeastern Eurasian plates with moment magnitudes Mw= 9. 1 and Mw= 8. 6, respectively. Complete data (mb ≥ 4. 2) of the post- 1993 time interval {{have been used}} to apply Poisson Hidden Markov models (PHMMs) for identifying temporal patterns in the time series of the two earthquake sequences. Each time series consists of earthquake counts, in given and constant time units, in the regions determined by the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> of the two mainshocks. In PHMMs each count is generated by one of m different Poisson processes that are called states. The series of states is unobserved and is in fact a Markov chain. The model incorporates a varying seismicity rate, it assigns a different rate to each state and it detects the changes on the rate over time. In PHMMs unobserved factors, related to the local properties of the region are considered affecting the earthquake occurrence rate. Estimation and interpretation of the unobserved sequence of states that underlie the data contribute to better understanding of the geophysical processes that take place in the region. We applied PHMMs to the time series of the two mainshocks and we estimated the unobserved sequences of states that underlie the data. The results obtained showed that the region of the 26 December 2004 earthquake was in state of low seismicity during almost the entire observation period. On the contrary, in the region of the 28 March 2005 earthquake the seismic activity is attributed to triggered seismicity, due to stress transfer from the region of the 2004 mainshock...|$|R
50|$|The mainshock was {{followed}} by a complex series of aftershocks extending over several months, which caused further damage and casualties The largest of the aftershocks, which consisted of two events about 2 seconds apart, had a magnitude of Ms = 6.5 and occurred on 15 June with an epicenter near Java. On 23 October 1992, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurred about 100 km east of the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zone.</b> It was also due to reverse faulting on a northnortheast-dipping plane, although with a significant dextral (right lateral) strike-slip component.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We analyze {{temporal}} {{variations of}} seismic velocity along the Karadere-Düzce {{branch of the}} north Anatolian fault using seismograms generated by repeating earthquake clusters in the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> of the 1999 Mw 7. 4 _Izmit and Mw 7. 1 Düzce earthquakes. The analysis employs 36 sets of highly repeating earthquakes, each containing 4 – 18 events. The events in each cluster are relocated by detailed multi-step analysis {{and are likely to}} rupture approximately the same fault patch at different times. The decay rates of the repeating events in individual clusters are compatible with the Omori’s law for the decay rate of regional aftershocks. A sliding window waveform cross-correlation technique is used to measure travel time differences and evolving decorrelation in waveforms generated by each set of the repeating events. We find clear step-like delays in the direct S and early S-coda waves (sharp seismic velocity reduction) immediately after the Düzce main shock, followed by gradual logarithmic-type recoveries. A gradual increase of seismic velocities is also observed before the Düzce main shock, probably reflecting post-seismic recovery from the earlier _Izmit main shock. The temporal behavior is similar at each station for clusters at various source locations, indicating that the temporal changes of material properties occur in the top most portion of the crust. The effects are most prominent at stations situated in the immediate vicinity of the recently ruptured fault zones, and generally decrease with normal distance from the fault. A strong correlation between the co-seismic delays and intensities of the strong ground motion generated by the Düzce main shock implies that the radiated seismic waves produced the velocity reductions in the shallow material...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{based on the}} {{precisely}} determined hypocenters and focal mechanisms, we considered the important question of why aftershocks occur. In order to address this question, we investigated whether aftershocks represent the rerupture of the mainshock fault plane or aftershocks occur on faults outside the mainshock fault plane. The aftershocks of the 2000 Western Tottori Earthquake were distributed within the zones of 1.0 – 1.5  km in thicknesses along the mainshock fault on which the coseismic slip occurred. These thicknesses of the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> cannot {{be explained by the}} location errors of hypocenters or the geometrical heterogeneity of the mainshock fault plane. This result suggests that most of the aftershocks represent the rupture of fractures surrounding the mainshock fault, rather than the rerupture of the mainshock fault. Moreover, the aftershocks were distributed within a much broader zone than the fault damage zone obtained in the geological observation. Since most aftershocks except in and around the large-slip region have a positive value of ΔCFF, it is suggested that the thickness of the aftershock distribution may be controlled by the stress changes caused by the slip during the mainshock. The hypocenters of the swarm activity in the geothermal region exhibit a narrower planar distribution compared with the aftershock sequence. This result implies a difference in the generation process: Earthquake swarms are controlled by the fault weakening process due to fluid intrusion into a fault damage zone that serves as a highly permeable channel, whereas aftershocks are caused primarily by stress changes due to slip dislocation during the mainshock or its afterslip. In summary, we conclude that the major factor in generating the aftershocks in this region is the stress changes caused by the slip related to the mainshock.|$|R
40|$|Following the M w 7. 9 Wenchuan {{earthquake}}, the M w 6. 6 Lushan earthquake {{is another}} devastating earthquake that struck the Longmenshan Fault Zone (LFZ) and caused severe damages. In this study, we collected continuous broadband ambient noise seismic data and earthquake event data from Chinese provincial digital seismic network, and then utilized ambient noise tomography method and receiver function method to obtain high resolution {{shear wave velocity}} structure, crustal thickness, and Poisson ratio in the earthquake source region and its surroundings. Based on the tomography images and the receiver function results, we further analyzed the deep seismogenic environment of the LFZ and its neighborhood. We reveal three main findings: (1) There is big contrast of the shear wave velocities across the LFZ. (2) Both the Lushan earthquake and the Wenchuan earthquake occurred in the regions where crustal shear wave velocity and crustal thickness change dramatically. The rupture faults and the <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> are also concentrated in the areas where the lateral gradients of crustal seismic wave speed and crustal thickness change significantly, and the focal depths of the earthquakes are concentrated in the transitional depths where shear wave velocities change dramatically from laterally uniform to laterally non-uniform. (3) The Wenchuan earthquake and its aftershocks occurred in low Poisson ratio region, while the Lushan earthquake sequences are located in high Poisson ratio zone. We proposed {{that the effect of}} the dramatic lateral variation of shear wave velocity, and the gravity potential energy differences caused by the big contrast in the topography and the crustal thickness across the LFZ may constitute the seismogenic environment for the strong earthquakes in the LFZ, and the Poisson ratio difference between the rocks in the south and north segments of the Longmenshan Fault zone may explain the 5 years delay of the occurrence of the Lushan earthquake than the Wenchuan earthquake. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The South Scotia Ridge Transform (SSRT) plate {{boundary}} between the Scotia and Antarctic plates experienced large strike-slip earthquakes on August 4, 2003 (Mw 7. 6) and November 17, 2013 (Mw 7. 8). These events have overlapping <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones,</b> which is unusual. A 36 °- 45 ° southward dipping fault zone ruptured with left-lateral displacements in each event along the northern margin of the South Orkney micro-continent near 60 °S. Slip distributions for the two events are determined using teleseismic body and surface wave recordings along with constraints from GPS ground motion recordings at station BORC on Laurie Island (South Orkney Islands), {{just south of the}} SSRT. The aftershock distributions, high-frequency back-projections, and unconstrained body wave finite-fault inversions permit significant overlap of the 2003 and 2013 slip zones; however, the GPS static displacements resolve differences in the large-slip regions of the two ruptures. The 2013 earthquake sequence along the SSRT initiated with Mw 6. 1 (November 13) and Mw 6. 8 (November 16) foreshocks located ~ 50 km west of the mainshock hypocenter, and had aftershocks extending ~ 250 km eastward. The rupture spread primarily eastward at ~ 2. 5 km/s with a total rupture duration of about 120 s, with two distinct patches of large-slip located northwest and northeast of the South Orkney Islands. The rupture swept past BORC, with high-rate GPS (HRGPS) ground motion recordings capturing the time-varying slip history of the faulting. Traditional GPS data require that the largest-slip region of the shorter rupture in 2003 is located in the gap NNE of BORC between the two patches that ruptured in 2013.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the source {{characteristics of the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, using teleseismic data. The solution from body waves gives a mechanism with a strike of 128 °, a dip of 70 ° a rake of 138 °, and a seismic moment of 3 x 10 ^(26) dyne-cm (M_w= 6. 9). This solution is similar to those obtained from long-period Rayleigh and Love waves, PnJ waves, and first-motion data. The body-wave solution suggests a depth of about 15 km. The effective duration of the source is 6 s, suggesting lengths of 30 and 15 km for bilateral and unilateral faulting, respectively. Considering {{the extent of the}} <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones,</b> we estimate a total rupture length of 35 km. The strike-slip and thrust components of coseismic slip are 177 and 159 cm, respectively. The large thrust component raises an important question regarding the recurrence pattern. If the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is a characteristic earthquake with a recurrence interval of about 100 yr, the 159 -cm displacement implies a long-term uplift rate of about 1 cm/yr, which appears too high for this region. Three hypotheses for reconciling this apparent conflict are that (1) the geometry of plate motion along the Santa Cruz Mountains section of the San Andreas fault changes on a time scale of several thousand years, and so the coseismic displacement has not accumulated enough to produce high topographic relief; (2) the coseismic-slip direction varies from event to event; and (3) the slip plane of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is distinct from the Pacific-North America plate boundary-if so, then this earthquake is a rather rare, noncharacteristic event. The surface slip of about 1 m for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake {{is one of the key}} data in long-term forecasting.

This temporal-spatial development relative to the main shock epicenter may indicate that the initial rupture propagated 7 km unilaterally to the WNW, and the initial rupture plane may have been considerably smaller than the eventual <b>aftershock</b> <b>zone.</b> This smaller area suggests that the stres...|$|E
40|$|The Santa Cruz Islands {{region has}} high {{seismicity}} near a 90 ° {{bend in the}} boundary between the Pacific and Australian plates. Southward, along the Vanuatu island arc, the Australian plate under-thrusts the Pacific plate in a well-defined subduction zone. Westward, a transpressional, predominantly transform boundary extends to the southern Solomon Islands subduction zone. The Santa Cruz Islands region has upper plate strike-slip and normal faulting, plate boundary under-thrusting, outer rise extensional faulting, and intraplate compressional faulting. On February 6, 2013 the largest under-thrusting earthquake (Mw 8. 0) that has been instrumentally recorded in the region ruptured the megathrust. The epicenter (10. 738 °S, 165. 138 °E) is about 1 ° north of epicenters of prior large shallow under-thrusting events in Vanuatu in 1934 (M ~ 7. 8) and 1966 (MS 7. 9), and there is overlap of all three events' <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones,</b> but not their large-slip regions. At least 10 lives were lost, with 6 more missing, due to tsunami ~ 1. 5 m high striking the town of Lata and several villages on the main Santa Cruz Island of Nendö (Ndeni) and a nearby small island Nibanga. Inundation of 500 m flooded the Lata airport. The tsunami was well-recorded by DART buoys spanning an unusually wide three-quadrant azimuthal aperture. Iterative modeling of teleseismic broadband P waves and the deep-water tsunami recordings resolves the slip distribution. There are two large-slip patches with a southeastward rupture expansion at about 1. 5 km/s, with the second patch appearing to have ruptured with large slip at the trench. The event has relatively low short-period seismic wave energy release, but a typical overall moment-scaled total energy. The shallow rupture depth may be associated with the low level of short-period energy, and a near-total stress drop may account for a lack of underthrusting aftershocks among a highly productive aftershock sequence that included three events with M_w ≥ 7. 0...|$|R
40|$|The South Scotia Ridge (SSR) left-lateral transform/strike-slip (S-S) fault {{defines the}} Scotia plate’s (SP) {{southern}} boundary separating {{it from the}} Powell Basin (PB), South Orkney Microcontinent (SOM), and the Weddell Sea sections of the Antarctic plate (AP). The SP developed as a space filling accommodation zone for S. America-Antarctica relative motions, mostly during the last 40 m. y. The SSR also hosts several restraining and releasing bends. The SP, PB and SOM have complex evolution histories including large-scale displacement and stretching of the SOM, {{as well as other}} continental fragments within the SP, all of which were incorporated into a background of changing sea floor spreading geometries. The SOM defines an ~ 300 km segment of the SSR opposite a section of the SP that is primarily oceanic crust with a few small, stretched continental fragments. Two large earthquakes, M 7. 6 and 7. 8, with <b>aftershock</b> <b>zones</b> largely confined to the northern SOM boundary, occurred on the SSR in 2003 and 2013. Moment tensor solutions show they occurred on faults dipping ~ 30 and 45 ° to the south. The 2013 event was almost pure, left-lateral strike-slip, while the 2003 event was oblique but predominantly strike-slip. This is an unusual combination of fault dip and slip direction for a strike-slip plate boundary. The half duration of both events is also relatively long. A continuous GPS (CGPS) station on Laurie Island is located immediately west of the rupture zone of the 2003 event and at the approximate center, and close to the surface projection, of the finite fault models for the 2013 earthquake. We present co-seismic static offsets and post-seismic transients for both earthquakes from GPS daily position estimates. In addition, the CGPS station now records at 1 Hz and we present the GPS displacement seismogram for the 2013 event. This record contains a complex signal that includes the passage of the Love and Rayleigh surface waves, with max displacements of ~ 70 cm, over an ~ 80 second time interval during which a ~ 50 cm static offset developed...|$|R
50|$|The shallow mainshock {{occurred}} in a highly populated area 70 km south of Sana'a. The primary event and its <b>aftershocks</b> created a <b>zone</b> of destruction between Ma'bar and Dhamar, where older villages were heavily damaged, with adobe or rubble masonry homes suffering the most. Homes and villages that were adjacent to steep slopes or cliffs were susceptible to rockfalls and landslides, but damage was much less pronounced away from the epicentral area, and modern city centers with properly engineered structures were only slightly affected.|$|R
