5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
60|$|I {{remembered the}} incident, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not imagine {{how it had}} reached his ears.|$|E
60|$|Now Maqueda {{began to}} speak, quietly enough, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see that she}} was quaking with passion.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} believing, <b>although</b> still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{understand}} her.|$|R
60|$|And {{he cautioned}} and advised me, in silver-mellow beneficent voice, as I essayed the venture {{of opening the}} chart-house door to gain outside. He knew the moment, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> have guessed it for myself, and gave the word that enabled me to win the poop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] I said. [...] "She isn't in the cabin,--you won't see HER. Come along." [...] He hesitated, <b>although</b> {{from what}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> discern of his bearded face it was weakly smiling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] I asked, turning cold in my limbs, for <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see {{her face}} because of a hood she wore, now I began to be afraid.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas five o'clock, and I could eat, [...] <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not pay my meal: [...] I hasten {{back into}} the street [...] Where lies my inn, the best Lille.|$|E
60|$|In {{about half}} an hour the wind lulled a little and I could get a better view of our surroundings, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see very far through the swiftly {{descending}} snow.|$|E
60|$|The cheerful, {{confident}} {{voice in}} which our friend said this raised my hopes wonderfully, even <b>although,</b> on consideration, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see that our chances of success were very great. Our guide was visibly comforted, and we stepped aside to pick up our rifles with considerable alacrity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, Miss Brooks," [...] he said gravely, [...] "for your thoughtfulness, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have still}} proven my innocence to Mr. Carstone, {{even if some}} unknown woman tried my door by mistake, and was seen doing it. But I am pained to think that YOU could have {{believed}} me capable of so wanton and absurd an impropriety--and such a gross disrespect to your mother's house." ...|$|R
60|$|I forbear {{to depict}} my sensations upon the gallows; <b>although</b> here, undoubtedly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{speak to the}} point, {{and it is a}} topic upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon such a theme it is {{necessary}} to have been hanged. Every author should confine himself to matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony composed a treatise upon getting drunk.|$|R
60|$|Forgetting {{that we were}} on the Road, I {{stretched}} out my hand; but, of course, it went quite through the hare, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the six little grey tufts clearly enough.|$|E
60|$|The poor frog {{had indeed}} {{come to a}} sad and sudden end, and I felt quite sorry for it, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help smiling at my companion's quaint manner of announcing the fact.|$|E
60|$|In fact, I did {{catch the}} deeper {{sound of a}} man's voice among the lighter tones, and the voice had a ring to it which was not wholly unfamiliar, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not place it.|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel’s countenance lighted as he {{took the}} paper; the silver {{spectacles}} were hurriedly replaced. ‘Ha!’ he said, ‘Alexandrines, the tragic metre. I shall cherish this, your Highness, like a relic; no more suitable offering, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> say it, <b>could</b> be made. “Dieux de l’immense plaine et des vastes forêts.” Very good,’ he said, ‘very good indeed! “Et du geôlier lui-même apprendre des leçons.” Most handsome, begad!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] said Higgs, [...] "that {{when first}} I heard this I {{was very angry}} with you, and thought you a set of beasts. But on {{considering}} things I saw {{the other side of}} it, and that you were right, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> come to fancy the idea of being sacrificed to a sphinx by being chucked like a piece of horse-flesh to a lot of holy lions. However, Barung, an excellent fellow in his way, assured me that there was no road out of the matter without giving grave offence to the priests, who are very powerful among the Fung, and bringing a fearful curse on the nation.|$|R
60|$|But as to myself, {{having been}} wearied out {{for many years}} with {{offering}} vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which as it is wholly new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expense and little trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging ENGLAND. For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation,[137] the flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, <b>although</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>could</b> name a country, which {{would be glad to}} eat up our whole nation without it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did in {{a measure}} mean it, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have shown Christian {{forgiveness}} {{if it had not}} been. Never mind; I will not see him. I'll plague my heart for the credit of my sex.' ...|$|E
60|$|They turned towards me, and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not make}} out the {{expressions}} of their faces, in the gloom, yet I doubted not but that they were puzzled ones at that lengthy and apparently meaningless harangue.|$|E
60|$|<b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{still hear}} the wind blowing {{strongly}} outside, I too was glad that its force had diminished so far that we felt no more the violent jerking that had disturbed us, and I soon fell asleep.|$|E
5000|$|... "Och yeah. At {{the moment}} there's some {{interest}} in Canal Dreams <b>although</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only sell it to Oliver Stone, anybody else doesn't have the clout not to get shoved off the picture and they'd just make it {{and turn it into}} American CIA propaganda. ... Actually of all the books, Canal Dreams is the one I'm least pleased with. By the usual reckoning, the worst books make the best films, so going on that it might be quite a good film! Make a film like Die Hard and cut out most {{of the first half of}} the book." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel's countenance lighted as he {{took the}} paper; the silver {{spectacles}} were hurriedly replaced. [...] "Ha!" [...] he said, [...] "Alexandrines, the tragic metre. I shall cherish this, your Highness, like a relic; no more suitable offering, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> say it, <b>could</b> be made. 'Dieux de l'immense plaine et des vastes forêts.' Very good," [...] he said, [...] "very good indeed! 'Et du geôlier lui-même apprendre des leçons.' Most handsome, begad!" ...|$|R
50|$|The Mark IA had {{a larger}} {{superstructure}} {{and a larger}} turret to give room for operating the machine gun. Horstmann suspension with horizontal coil springs replaced the leaf springs of the Mark <b>I.</b> <b>Although</b> it <b>could</b> give an easy ride under moderate conditions, the springs could under certain circumstances cause an uncontrollable bounce.|$|R
6000|$|... "But in {{that case}} I shall {{not be able to}} get the money to pay you, for I shall not be known; and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> doubtless get a passage, I do not think that I could obtain any funds." ...|$|E
60|$|It surely {{seemed as}} if they must see us, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make out even a shadow of her, strain my eyes as I might, and in case we were discovered, the end would come very rapidly, as I then believed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did expect you. Anyhow, I heard {{white men}} were coming, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only account for one," [...] {{he said and}} added with an ominous smile: [...] "I sent to meet you because I did not want you to lose your way." ...|$|E
60|$|The moon {{began to}} shine--that {{wonderful}} African moon, which turns night to day--throwing {{a network of}} long, black shadows of trees and rocks across the game track I was following. Right ahead of me was a particularly dark patch of this shadow, caused by a projecting wall of cliff, and beyond it an equally bright patch of moonlight. Somehow I misdoubted me of that stretch of gloom, for <b>although,</b> of course, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see nothing there, my quick ear caught the sound of movements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{very popular in}} Egypt. Sandra Nashaat said [...] "The film was as well {{received}} as <b>I</b> expected, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> feel it <b>could</b> have been seen by {{a greater number of}} people. But of course due to the war fewer people are going to the movies. One of my concerns was that Harameya fi Thailand would be compared and contrasted with Harameya fi KG2, because they are two entirely different films. In the end the inevitable happened, but at least it was positive: many liked Harameya fi Thailand more." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew not}} now what to say, for <b>although</b> <b>I</b> felt {{sure that that}} word was for him {{as well as for}} me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{remember}} any other word whereby <b>I</b> <b>could</b> prove it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Wellmere!" [...] cried young Wharton {{in astonishment}} as they entered, [...] "has the fortune of war been thus cruel to you also? But {{you are welcome}} {{to the house of}} my father, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish the {{introduction}} to have taken place under more happy circumstances." ...|$|E
60|$|I arose {{and paced}} the floor. There was entirely too much force in this man's arguments, but, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{immediately}} answer him, his cool determination to persevere in his iniquitous designs so angered me that I {{declared that he}} should be punished if I had to do it myself.|$|E
60|$|As {{they drew}} nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see and hear}} all that went on around me. Two or three of the {{soldiers}} jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them raised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.|$|E
60|$|Willie indeed {{listened to}} me with {{considerable}} attention; but I was no sooner finished, than he immediately mimicked on his own instrument the fantastic complication of tones which I had produced, and made so whimsical a parody of my performance, that, <b>although</b> somewhat angry, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help laughing heartily, in which I was joined by Benjie, whose reverence for me held him under no restraint; while the poor dame, fearful, doubtless, of my taking offence at this familiarity, seemed divided betwixt her conjugal reverence for her Willie, and her desire {{to give him a}} hint for his guidance.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's rather awkward," [...] Helen remarked thoughtfully. [...] "He {{asked if}} he might bring his wife over, and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> wasn't very gracious, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou wert ever {{prone to}} court danger, Glumm," [...] said Erling with a laugh, as they hurried towards Haldorstede, [...] "and methinks thou art {{going to be}} blessed with a full share of it just now, for this Harald Haarfager {{is not a man}} to be trifled with. <b>Although</b> thou and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold our own against some odds, we shall find the odds too much for us in the King's camp, should he set his face against us. However, the cause is a good one, and to say truth, I am not sorry that they had the {{goodness}} to pitch on thee and me to carry out the plan." ...|$|R
