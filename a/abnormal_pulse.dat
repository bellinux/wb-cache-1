50|$|Several {{hypotheses}} for {{the association}} were proposed, {{the most prominent}} being {{the idea that there}} is no causal relationship between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, they are both just common conditions in the elderly, and they sometimes overlap. Other hypotheses included hypoxia of the colonic mucosa and bowel ischemia due to low blood flow, both of which were discounted by later research. Another early hypothesis of note was proposed by Greenstein et al. in 1986. They suggested that GI bleeding could be caused by thinning of the wall of the cecum due to <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> waves in the ileocolic artery (an artery that supplies blood to the cecum) causing dilation of that artery. Specifically, they note that the usual anacrotic and dicrotic notches were absent from the pulse waves of their people with aortic stenosis. There has been no further research investigating this hypothesis, however, as it has been eclipsed by newer research into acquired von Willebrand’s disease.|$|E

40|$|Technology {{has had a}} {{tremendous}} impact on our daily lives. Recently, technology and its impact on aging has become an expanding field of inquiry. A major reason for this interest is that the use of technology can help older people who experience deteriorating health to live independently. In this paper we give a brief review of the in-home monitoring technologies for the elderly. In the pilot study, we analyze the possibility of employing the data generated by a continuous, unobtrusive nursing home monitoring system for predicting elevated (<b>abnormal)</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure (PP) in elderly (PP = systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure). Our sensor data capture external information (behavioral) about the resident that is subsequently reflected in the predicted PP. By continuously predicting the possibility of elevated pulse pressure we may alert the nursing staff when some predefined threshold is exceeded. This approach may provide additional blood pressure monitoring for the elderly persons susceptible to blood pressure variations during the time between two nursing visits. We conducted a retrospective pilot study on two residents of the TigerPlace aging in place facility with age over 70, that had blood pressure measured between 100 and 300 times during a period of two years.

The three data sources for the study were (1) the generic screen results of a 3 percent random sample of Medicare beneficiaries age 65 years or older who were admitted to California hospitals between 1 July 1987 and 30 June 1988 (n = 20, 136 patients); (2) the 1987 and 1988 California Medicare Provided Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) data files; and (3) the American Hospital Association (AHA) 1988 Annual Survey of Hospitals. STUDY DESIGN. Multivariate logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the association between the results of generic discharge administered by the PROs and two patient outcomes: mortality and readmission within 30 days. The analysis was adjusted for other patient characteristics recorded on the uniform discharge abstract. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Four discharge screens indicated an increased risk of an adverse outcome-absence of documentation of discharge planning, elevated temperature, <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse,</b> and unaddressed abnormal test results at discharge. The other three discharge screens examined-abnormal blood pressure, IV fluids or drugs, and wound drainage before discharge-were unrelated to postdischarge adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS. Generic discharge screens based on inadequate discharge planning, <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse,</b> increased temperature, or unaddressed abnormal tests may be important indicators of substandard care.

40|$|Before macrovascular {{disease is}} established, type 2 {{diabetes}} is associated with structural andfunctional changes in large arteries that lead to increased stiffness, <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> wave travel and systolic hypertension. Structural changes result mainly from glycation of wall components. Functional changes originate in endothelial dysfunction. Increased arterial stiffness, or decreased arterial distensibility, increases pulse wave velocity and the amplitude of reflected waves, so that reflected waves arrive early and augment central systolic pressure. This promotes the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality.

40|$|Introduction: Trauma {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the leading causes of death in many countries for decades. Reduction in mortality and morbidity rate of trauma cases is one of the most important attitudes in this field. Evaluation of different risk factors have been considered as the main goal of some studies. The purpose of this study was determining potential risk factors of death in trauma patients. Method: In a retrograde study, data of 740 patients admitted during three years (2009 - 2011) were studied. Demographic data (sex and age), clinical factors (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, Glasgow coma scale (GCS)), trauma characteristics (location, type of injury, etc.), as well as outcome of patients were evaluated. Data analyses was done using SPSS 18. 0. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis was used for recognition of independent predictive factors of death in multiple trauma patients. Results: Of those admitted, majority of patients were male (81. 4 %), 68 % between 18 to 60 years, and 11. 2 % of them died during the course of treatment. Age; type of trauma; abnormal respiration rate, pulse rate, blood pressure; total GCS ≤ 8; abnormal pupil size; and head and neck; vertebral, and extremities fractures were obtained as significant predictive factor of death. GCS≤ 8, head and neck fracture, and <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> rate were independent death predictors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The K-Ar {{dates and}} oxygen isotope data of illite-to-mica mineral phases in Permian to Triassic {{sandstones}} from Germany and Libya have {{been compared to}} previously published results of similar minerals of Liassic ages taken from lithologically similar rocks in several sites in western Europe and northern Africa. The widespread Liassic age for the micaceous mineral phases {{can be related to}} <b>abnormal</b> heat <b>pulses</b> induced by pre-rifting conditions. The temperatures in most cases appeared to be in the 150 - 220 ~ range. Some of these hydrothermal ctivities were responsible for both gas generation and U and Pb-Zn concentrations. An approach combining K-Ar isotope dates and oxygen isotope signatures provides a framework for the characterization f the clay separates used in isotopic investigations and for depicting any crystallization conditions. The trend in decreases in 5180 values relative to increases in K-Ar dates, while the size of the clay fractions in a single sample increases, is indicative of detrital contamination. Varied trends in the 5180 values at constant K-Ar dates for clay fractions with increase in size might be indicative of changes in the pore volume of the host rocks. Since the late 1970 s, several isotopic studies, mainly of K-Ar type, have reported dates rangin...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} different research topics. One is a ?Nano Scale Device for Plasmonic Nanolithography ? Optical Antenna? {{and the other}} is a ?Nano Scale Device for Rapid Sensing of Bacteria ? SEPTIC?. Since these two different research topics have little analogy to each other, they were divided into different chapters throughout the whole dissertation. The ?Optical Antenna? and ?Nanowell / Microwell / ISFET Sensor? represent the device names of each topic ?Plasmonic Nanolithography? and ?Rapid Sensing of Bacteria?, respectively. For plasmonic nanolithography, we demonstrated a novel photonic device - Optical Antenna (OA) - that works as a nano scale object lens. It consists of a number of sub-wavelength features in a metal film coated on a quartz substrate. The device focuses the incident light to form a narrow beam in the near-field and even far-field region. The narrow beam lasts for up to several wavelengths before it diverges. We demonstrated that the OA was able to focus a subwavelength spot with a working distance (also the focal length) of several ?m, theoretically and experimentally. The highest imaging resolution (90 -nm spots) is more than a 100 % improvement of the diffraction limit (FWHM = 210 nm) in conventional optics. A model and 3 D electromagnetic simulation results were also studied. Given its small footprint and subwavelength resolution, the PL holds great promise in direct-writing and scanning microscopy. Collaborative work demonstrated a Nanowell (or Microwell) device which enables a rapid and specific detection of bacteria using nano (or micro) scale probe to monitor the electric field fluctuations caused by ion leakage from the bacteria. When a bacteriophage infects a bacterium and injects its DNA into the host cell, a massive and transitory ion efflux from the host cell occurs. SEPTIC (SEnsing of Phage-Triggered Ion Cascade) technology developed by collaboration uses a nanowell device to detect the nano-scale electric field fluctuations caused by this ion efflux. The SEPTIC provides fast (within several minutes), effective (living cell only), phage specific (simple and less malfunction), cheap, compact and robust method for bacteria sensing. We fabricated a number of devices, including ?Nanowell?, ?Microwell?, and ?ISFET (Ion Selective Field Effect Transistor) ?, which detect bacteria-phage reactions in frequency domain and time domain. In the frequency domain, detected noise spectrum is characterized by ? f / 1. The positive reaction showed much higher 1 ? ? than that of background noise or negative reaction (0 ? ?). For the time domain, we observed <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulses</b> (> ? 8) lasting 0. 1 ~ 0. 3 s which match the duration of ion flux reported by prior literatures. And the ISFET showed the phage-infection-triggered pulse {{in the form of the}} deviated drain current.

40|$|International audiencePeripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{has been}} demonstrated to be prevalent in the primary care setting. However, {{it has also been}} shown to be unrecognized and under-treated. Owing to the association with cardiovascular disease it has been recommended to screen high-risk patients for PAD in the primary care setting using the ankle-brachial index (ABI). ABI {{has been demonstrated}} to be highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing PAD in patients with significant stenosis. However, the utility in patients with less severe stenosis and calcified vessels is in question. The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic utility of measuring the ABI at rest in patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation of suspected PAD, and to assess the added value of pulse volume recordings and post-exercise studies in patients with a normal ABI. A computerized vascular diagnostic laboratory database was queried for symptomatic outpatients referred for measurement of segmental blood pressure, the ABI or pulse volume recordings by physicians not specialized in the evaluation and management of patients with peripheral vascular disease. Of 707 patients undergoing outpatient physiologic arterial evaluations between February 1, 2003 and July 31, 2004, 396 met these inclusion criteria. Data recorded included resting ABI, ABI following treadmill exercise test and the presence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> volume recordings. The study population (= 396) consisted of equal numbers of men and women (mean age 69 years, range 19 - 100 years). Among 396 studies, resting ABI values were normal in 183 (46. 2 %) and abnormal in 159 (40. 2 %). Of the 138 patients who underwent exercise testing, 84 had normal ABI readings at rest. In the 84 patients who had a normal ABI at rest and underwent exercise testing, the ABI fell below 0. 9 after exercise in 26 (31 %). Arterial non-compressibility was detected in 54 (13. 6 %) patients, whose average age was 67 years. Thirteen (24 %) of those with non-compressible vessels had <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> volume recording (PVR) results, compared to five with normal resting ABI who had abnormal PVR findings (2. 7 %). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that nearly half of patients referred to the outpatient vascular laboratory because of suspected arterial disease had a normal resting ABI. While it is recommended that the ABI be measured at rest in patients at risk of PAD in primary care practice, these findings suggest that patients with symptoms of PAD should be more completely evaluated in a vascular laboratory. Furthermore, when the ABI is normal at rest in patients with symptoms of intermittent claudication, exercise testing is recommended to enhance the sensitivity for detection of PAD...|$|E

40|$|Heart {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of death in human beings. A survey shows every year about 900, 000 peoples die due to heart {{diseases}} worldwide. Carotid pulse is a pressure signal recorded over the carotid artery as it passes near the surface of the body at the neck. An <b>abnormal</b> carotid <b>pulse</b> called the dicrotic pulse occurs when patients suffer from sepsis, hypovolemic shock, cardiac tamponade, aortic stenosis. Dicrotic notch usually denotes a very low stroke volume, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Lehner and Rangayyan proposed a methodology to detect this dicrotic notch in the carotid pulse signal. This method used the least-squares estimate of the second derivative because a first-derivative operation would give an almost-constant output for the downward slope. In this paper, a digital system is designed to detect the dicrotic notch in the carotid pulse using Verilog Hardware Description Language. Hardware description languages such as Verilog differ from software programming languages because they include ways of describing the propagation of time and signal dependencies (sensitivity). Verilog modules that conform to a synthesizable coding-style, known as RTL (register transfer level), can be physically realized by synthesis software. Synthesis-software algorithmically transforms the Verilog source code into a netlist, a logically-equivalent description consisting only of elementary logic primitives (AND, OR, NOT, flip-flops, etc.) that are available in a specific FPGA or VLSI technology. Further manipulations to the netlist ultimately lead to a circuit fabrication blueprint. Here architecture of a digital system for detection of dicrotic notch in the carotid pulse signal has been proposed by using Verilog HDL based XILINX FPG...|$|R

Continuous 1 -hour lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring was done in eight children with pseudotumor cerebri on admission and at weekly intervals until the baseline pressure had normalized. (One child had two episodes of pseudotumor cerebri). All patients were treated with oral acetazolamide and furosemide until papilledema had cleared. Raised intracranial pressure was present on admission in all nine episodes of pseudotumor cerebri. Six children had an increased baseline cerebrospinal fluid pressure, whereas raised intracranial pressure was diagnosed in three children on account of an <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> wave and/or pressure waves. The mean baseline pressure was significantly lower after the 1 st week of treatment than on admission (P =. 007) and normalized in all patients within 6 weeks of start of therapy. All children had a rapid clinical response. Combined therapy with acetazolamide and furosemide is an effective first-line method of treating raised intracranial pressure in children with pseudotumor cerebri. The good correlation found between the clinical response and normalization of baseline cerebrospinal fluid pressure suggests that clinical monitoring of treatment is adequate in most children with this condition.

40|$|Background & objectives: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{the sixth}} {{leading cause of}} death in individuals older than 25 years, and accounts for % 18 of all deaths. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the TCD findings in diabetic patients with a history of less and more than 5 years. Methods: In this descriptive, analytic study, all diabetic patients were divided into two groups based on the duration of diabetes, less and more than 5 years after diagnosis. TCD was performed on the patients, and maximum velocity and mean pulsatility index and resistivity index in the right and left Middle Cerebral Arteries (MCAs) and basilar artery were measured. The checklist was completed for all patients, and all data were analyzed by SPSS (v 16) statistical software. Results: Sixty four percent of the patients with duration less than 5 years (average age of 55. 16 years) and 36 percent of those with duration more than 5 years (average age of 59. 37 years) were men. There was no statistically significant difference between disease duration and Body Mass Index (BMI), but with an increase in duration of disease, HbA 1 C of patients was increased. There was no significant difference between the velocity of right, left and basilar arteries and diabetes duration. Also, there was a significant difference between diabetes duration and pulse index of right MCA and basilar. There was no significant difference between age, BMI and HbA 1 C and pulse and resistivity indexes among patients. Conclusion: In this study <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> and resistance indexes in patients with duration more than 5 years was more than patients with less than 5, this may indicate the effect of diabetes duration on the vascular wall...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{design basis}} accidents, some {{inherent}} uncertainties of {{the reliability of}} instrumentations are expected while subjected to harsh environments (e. g., high temperature and pressure, high humidity, and high radioactivity) occurring in severe nuclear accident conditions. Even under such conditions, an electrical signal should be within its expected range so that some mitigating actions can be taken based on the signal in the control room. For example, an industrial process control standard requires that the normal signal level for pressure, flow, and resistance temperature detector sensors be {{in the range of}} 4 ~ 20 [*]mA for most instruments. Whereas, in the case that an abnormal signal is expected from an instrument, such a signal should be refined through a signal validation process so that the refined signal could be available in the control room. For some abnormal signals expected under severe accident conditions, to date, diagnostics and response analysis have been evaluated with an equivalent circuit model of real instruments, which is regarded as the best method. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} introduce a program designed to implement a diagnostic and response analysis for equivalent circuit modeling. The program links signal analysis tool code to abnormal signal simulation engine code not only as a one body order system, but also as a part of functions of a PC-based ASSA (abnormal signal simulation analysis) module developed to obtain a varying range of the R-C circuit elements in high temperature conditions. As a result, a special function for <b>abnormal</b> <b>pulse</b> signal patterns can be obtained through the program, which in turn makes it possible to analyze the abnormal output pulse signals through a response characteristic of a 4 ~ 20 [*]mA circuit model and a range of the elements changing with temperature under an accident condition...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} 24 hour {{growth hormone}} secretion by intermittent 20 minute blood sampling in 34 prepubertal patients with Turner's syndrome, aged 4. 3 - 12. 4 years. Growth hormone profiles were analysed by the PULSAR programme and results expressed as {{the sum of}} growth hormone pulse amplitudes. Six patients had <b>abnormal</b> growth hormone <b>pulse</b> frequencies. In the remaining 28, growth hormone pulse amplitudes declined significantly with increasing age, {{but there was no}} correlation between growth hormone pulse amplitudes and growth rates. Concentrations of insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) rose with age but did not correlate with either growth rates or growth hormone secretion. Fifteen patients were given oxandrolone and 11 low dose ethinyl oestradiol. Both agents increased height velocity without increasing growth hormone secretion. We conclude that the relation between growth hormone secretion and growth in Turner's syndrome is less certain than in normal children. End organ resistance is probably due to a skeletal dysplasia. Both oxandrolone and low dose ethinyl oestradiol improve the growth of girls with Turner's syndrome, but their mechanism of action remains uncertain...|$|R
40|$|T HIS REPORT {{describes}} {{a group of}} chil-dren, ages 3 to 13, who present unusual cardiac findings suggestive of the earliest stages of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Idio-pathic cardiomyopathy refers to an enlarge-ment of the heart without apparent cause, but primarily due to muscular hypertrophy. The process is dominant in the left ventricle, but can involve other chambers, either pri-marily or secondarily after left ventricular failure. When hypertrophy involves the inter-ventricular septum, there may be obstruction to left ventricular outflow and aggravation of the myopathic state. In the cases to be de-scribed, the diagnosis has been made largely on clinical grounds. The most important cri-teria are an abnormal left ventricular impulse with cardiomegaly, an <b>abnormal</b> jugular ve-nous <b>pulse,</b> and an acquired characteristic murmur. Since most of the patients are asymptomatic and all are living, no autopsy or biopsy studies are presented. In the past, reports have been concerned with the late stages of cardiomyopathies. - 4 The majority of patients were adults who presented with congestive failure, and documentation was frequently made by autopsy. It is clear that little is known of the early natural history of the cardiomyopathy disease complex. It is our speculation that the cardiomyopathies run a protracted course measured best in decades rather than years. This study deals with what may be early manifestations of that process. Methods Twenty-seven cases have been identified during a 2 -year period. All were studied beeause of a heart murmur. The patients were selected from the general outpatient clinic population of Babie...|$|R
40|$|Instantaneous {{ascending}} aortic {{blood flow}} was recorded at operation in five patients with severe, pure mitral regurgitation, and in nine dogs in which mitral re-gurgitation was produced experimentally under controlled conditions. In both the patients and the experimental animals, {{the pattern of}} aortic flow was abnormal during mitral regurgitation: peak flow occurred early, the percentage of total forward flow was abnormally high {{during the first half}} of the ejection period and abnormally low during the last quarter. When stroke volume, heart rate, and aortic pressure were maintained constant, mitral regurgitation also resulted in increases in peak flow, mean ejection rate, and maximum acceleration of flow. These abnormalities of the aortic flow patterns are attributable to inability of the ventricle to sustain forward ejection during late systole in the presence of severe regurgitant flow through the mitral valve. Additional Indexing Words: Left ventricular pressure Peak flow Total forward flow Ejection period ONE of the physical findings commonly noted in patients with severe mitral regurgitation is an <b>abnormal</b> peripheral ar-terial <b>pulse,</b> usually described as being slightly water-hammer in quality, with an abrupt up-stroke and early precipitous downstroke. When such patients are studied by means of left heart catheterization, the contour of the left ventricular pressure pulse may also demonstrate a characteristic abnormality: the pressure rises rapidly during isometric con-traction and declines at an unusually rapid rate during the late ejection period, the time at which the left atrial pressure becomes greatest. These abnormal patterns of arterial and ventricular pressure suggested that severe mitral regurgitation might also alter the pat-tern of instantaneous aortic flow, and this possibility was the subject of the clinical and laboratory investigations described herein...|$|R
