5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.|$|E

Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|E

25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{reviewed}} the 30-knot target track {{to try to}} determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to {{the area where the}} TWA800 wreckage had fallen. TWA800 was behind the target, and with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the occupants would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft's breakup or subsequent explosions or fireball(s). Additionally, it was unlikely that the occupants of the target track {{would have been able to}} hear the explosions over the sound of its engines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of the hull traveling through water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin. Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and cargo vessel traffic.|$|E
25|$|The new {{division}} {{was still being}} formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Gerät beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that {{broke out in the}} congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 2008, {{four more}} protesters left the grove, leaving three protesters {{still in the}} trees. At 11:00 pm three of the tree-sitters were seen on the ground, {{at which point the}} UCPD arrested one of them for {{trespassing}} and violating a court order, causing the other two to take refuge in a nearby tree. Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya talked to the two tree-sitters for a couple of hours, at which point they agreed to come down. One of the protesters who was talked down did so with the condition that they would be allowed to make a video statement. Another protester came down later in the day after indicating that she might have an undetermined medical condition that would require treatment. RunningWolf said that she collapsed three times once she was on the ground. RunningWolf blamed the conditions on the long exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and lack of sleep due to the lights the police set up surrounding the grove <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> from the generators needed to power them. The university said they were happy that their strategy to get the tree-sitters to leave the grove was working. RunningWolf said that the remaining protesters would remain in the trees until at least 2008-07-17, when Judge Miller was expected to make a final ruling.|$|E
25|$|That half of {{the party}} returns to Ritardando to reunite {{with the rest of}} the party. As they do, Allegretto leaves the reunion to {{retrieve}} Polka from her village. The full party then heads for Baroque and decide to explore Aria Temple, where they uncover a part of the mystery. When the party returns to Baroque, they find Crescendo and Serenade missing. It is discovered that they left for Forte to turn themselves in to prevent war. The party heads for Forte, and on the way (at Mt. Rock), they encounter Crescendo, Serenade and subsequently, Count Waltz. They battle, but Count Waltz completes a potion which turns his partner, Legato into a giant monster. Legato then rips a portal in the air and disappears with Waltz. Realizing that the entire world, not just Baroque is in danger, the party follows them to the city of the dead, Elegy Of The Moon, where souls lost to the mineral powder dwell. The party advances past Xylophone Tower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Noise</b> Dunes to Double Reed Tower, where Legato made another portal. There, the party defeats them and finally fight Chopin as the final antagonist, for him to complete his destiny. Realizing that it is the only way to save the world, Polka jumps off a cliff and is reborn younger, but then becomes older again and embraces Allegretto. Finally, back in the real world, Chopin’s spirit rises out of his body and he plays his piano one last time, in a blooming sea of nocturnal flowers 'Heaven's Mirror', composing a song that was inspired by Polka.|$|E
500|$|In 1834, when Prince Alexandru II Ghica {{came to the}} throne, Heliade {{became one}} of his close collaborators, styling himself [...] "court poet". Several of the poems and discourses he {{authored}} during the period are written as panegyrics, and dedicated to Ghica, whom Heliade depicted as an ideal prototype of a monarch. As young reformists came into conflict with the prince, he kept his neutrality, arguing that all sides involved represented a privileged minority, and that the disturbances were equivalent to [...] "the quarrel of wolves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> made by those in higher positions over the torn-apart animal that is the peasant". He was notably critical of the radical Mitică Filipescu, whom he satirized in the poem Căderea dracilor ("The Demons' Fall"), and later defined his own position with the words [...] "I hate tyrants. I fear anarchy".|$|E

500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a bird of open country such as {{farmland}} or grassland with some interspersed woodland, usually at altitudes below [...] but occasionally {{as high as}} [...] in the tropics. This owl prefers to hunt {{along the edges of}} woods or in rough grass strips adjoining pasture. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters the ground, alert to the sounds made by potential prey. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing turbulence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the barbules of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies, as shown {{in the case of the}} European T. a. guttata and [...] T. a. alba that probably evolved, respectively, in allopatric glacial refugia in southeastern Europe, and in Iberia or southern France.|$|E
500|$|The hip hop group Public Enemy in {{particular}} has been noted for its use of noise in its music. The group's second album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), was backed by the production team The Bomb Squad, who helped craft the album's layered, anti-harmonic, anarchic noise. Michael Eric Dyson describes the album as a [...] "powerful mix of music, beats, screams, noise, and rhythms from the streets", and considers it {{an example of the}} revival of black radical and nationalist thought. Public Enemy member Chuck D acknowledges that the group's use of noise was an intentional attempt to blur the boundaries between popular music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of everyday life, a decision which writer Jason W. Buel says [...] "ran directly counter to the values of mainstream music of the time." [...] He explains that [...] "without a doubt" [...] this intentional use of noise influenced not only the next decade of hip-hop, but of rock as well. Furthermore, notes Buel, the incorporation of noise served a political function, elevating the ordinary and thus suggesting that common, ordinary people should consider themselves on the same footing as their political and cultural leaders.|$|E
