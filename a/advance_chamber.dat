40|$|A new PTW <b>advanced</b> Markus {{ionization}} <b>chamber</b> {{has been}} implemented in IMRT fields, to measure surface dose at ICRU and ICRP reference depth of 0. 07 mm [ICRU Report 39, Determination of dose equivalents resulting from external radiation sources, 1985; ICRP Publication 60, 1990 {{recommendations of the}} International Commission on Radiological Protection, 1991]. This chamber has a small radius with a revised guard ring design, therefore less prone to surface over-response effects. The over response correction for <b>advanced</b> Markus <b>chamber</b> is 3. 3 %, which is significantly smaller than 10. 1 % which was the original Markus chamber over response. After over response correction, the surface dose can be accurately measured by either data extrapolation or by adding one layer of plastic sheet protector {{to the top of}} Markus chamber. The surface dose measurements for small fields, e. g 3 × 3 cm, the polarity effect of <b>advanced</b> Markus <b>chamber</b> is 12 %, which is significantly higher than the 5 % polarity effect of the original Markus. For a 12 × 12 cm field size, surface dose (at 0. 07 mm) measured by <b>advanced</b> Markus <b>chamber</b> is 19. 8 % for open field and 19. 2 % for an unmodulated step-and-shoot IMRT field. The variation in surface dose due to intensity modulated IMRT fields has also been investigated.

50|$|The kilns allowed large {{quantities}} of pottery to be fired at high temperatures, but the firing was not usually even across {{the length of the}} kiln, which often produced different effects on pieces at different levels. Very often the higher chambers produced the better pieces, as they heated up more slowly. As one example, the wide range of colours seen in Chinese celadon wares such as Yue ware and Longquan celadon is largely explained by variations in firing conditions. Variations in the shades of white porcelains between and within the northern Ding ware and the southern Qingbai were also the result of the fuel used. Some of the most <b>advanced</b> <b>chambered</b> kilns were built to fire Dehua porcelain, where precise control of high temperatures was essential. The dragon kiln form was copied in Korea, from sometime between 100 and 300 CE, and much later in Japan in various types of climbing anagama kilns, and elsewhere in East Asia.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the first phase of a program {{for the development of a}} coal-fired residential combustion system. This phase consisted of the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of an advanced pulse combustor sized for residential space heating requirements. The objective was to develop an advanced pulse coal combustor at the {approximately} 100, 000 Btu/hr scale that can be integrated into a packaged space heating system for small residential applications. The strategy for the development effort included the scale down of the feasibility unit from 1 - 2 MMBtu/hr to 100, 000 Btu/hr to establish a baseline for isolating the effect of scale-down and new chamber configurations separately. Initial focus at the residential scale was concentrated on methods of fuel injection and atomization in a bare metal unit. This was followed by incorporating changes to the <b>advanced</b> <b>chamber</b> designs and testing of refractory-lined units. Multi-fuel capability for firing oil or gas as a secondary fuel was also established. Upon completion of the configuration and component testing, an optimum configuration would be selected for integrated testing of the pulse combustor unit. The strategy also defined the use of Dry Ultrafine Coal (DUC) for Phases 1 and 2 of the development program with CWM firing to be a product improvement activity for a later phase of the program...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{establish}} an empirical model of the ion recombination in the <b>Advanced</b> Markus ionization <b>chamber</b> for measurements in high dose rate/dose-per-pulse electron beams. In addition, we compared the observed ion recombination to calculations using the standard Boag two-voltage-analysis method, the more general theoretical Boag models, and the semiempirical general equation presented by Burns and McEwen. Two independent methods were used to investigate the ion recombination: (a) Varying the grid tension of the linear accelerator (linac) gun (controls the linac output) and measuring the relative effect the grid tension has on the chamber response at different source-to-surface distances (SSD). (b) Performing simultaneous dose measurements and comparing the dose-response, in beams with varying dose rate/dose-per-pulse, with the chamber together with dose rate/dose-per-pulse independent Gafchromic™ EBT 3 film. Three individual <b>Advanced</b> Markus <b>chambers</b> {{were used for the}} measurements with both methods. All measurements were performed in electron beams with varying mean dose rate, dose rate within pulse, and dose-per-pulse (10 (- 2)  ≤ mean dose rate ≤  10 (3) Gy/s, 10 (2)  ≤ mean dose rate within pulse ≤  10 (7)  Gy/s, 10 (- 4)  ≤ dose-per-pulse ≤  10 (1)  Gy), which was achieved by independently varying the linac gun grid tension, and the SSD. The results demonstrate how the ion collection efficiency of the chamber decreased as the dose-per-pulse increased, and that the ion recombination was dependent on the dose-per-pulse rather than the dose rate, a behavior predicted by Boag theory. The general theoretical Boag models agreed well with the data over the entire investigated dose-per-pulse range, but only for a low polarizing chamber voltage (50  V). However, the two-voltage-analysis method and the Burns & McEwen equation only agreed with the data at low dose-per-pulse values (≤  10 (- 2) and ≤  10 (- 1)  Gy, respectively). An empirical model of the ion recombination in the chamber was found by fitting a logistic function to the data. The ion collection efficiency of the <b>Advanced</b> Markus ionization <b>chamber</b> decreases for measurements in electron beams with increasingly higher dose-per-pulse. However, this chamber is still functional for dose measurements in beams with dose-per-pulse values up toward and above 10  Gy, if the ion recombination is taken into account. Our results show that existing models give a less-than-accurate description of the observed ion recombination. This motivates the use of the presented empirical model for measurements with the <b>Advanced</b> Markus <b>chamber</b> in high dose-per-pulse electron beams, as it enables accurate absorbed dose measurements (uncertainty estimation: 2. 8 - 4. 0 %, k =  1). The model depends on the dose-per-pulse in the beam, and it is also influenced by the polarizing chamber voltage, with increasing ion recombination with a lowering of the voltage...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} examination of congressional oversight of administrative agencies. In order to exert control and ensure that legislative mandates are faithfully carried out, Congress needs its members to act as overseers of the bureaucracy. I characterize congressional control of agencies as an institutional public good and argue that the chamber faces a collective action problem in providing it. The problem for the chamber is that it relies on the voluntary eﬀorts of individual members to help advance collective goals, creating incentives for those members to shirk their oversight responsibilities. Despite these incentives, existing {{studies show that the}} chamber regularly performs oversight, suggesting that concerns about congressional control may be overstated. The explanation for oversight provided in this dissertation suggests that such conclusions would be hasty. I depart from most literature on congressional control by focusing on the choices made by individual members, attempting to more clearly specify the individual-level incentives that lead (or do not lead) to oversight. First, I provide new evidence from individual-level behavior that members regularly make the choice to involve themselves in oversight of agencies. Next, I propose an explanation for oversight. Instead of <b>advancing</b> <b>chamber</b> goals, I argue that members use oversight to advance the policy goals of organized interests, receiving electoral support in exchange. What appears to be active oversight is actually members selectively applying pressure to agencies in an eﬀort to ensure that policy beneﬁts go to key interest groups. The following two chapters take up the task of testing that explanation, looking at how the oversight agenda is set within committees and which members actively choose to engage in oversight. By highlighting a disconnect between the needs of Congress as an institution and the incentives faced by individual members of Congress, this dissertation calls into question the ability of Congress to collectively defend against Executive Branch encroachment...|$|R
