25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

[...] In the case of the former, Karunatillake points out that the moment of inertia parameters indicate that the core of the moon is both dense and small, with the rest of the moon consisting of material with nearly-constant density. [...] As for the latter, he notes that the moon is the only planetary body besides Earth on which extensive seismic observations have been made. [...] These observations have constrained the thickness of the moon's crust, mantle and core, suggesting it could not be hollow.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said [...] "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" [...] and that Angelo Badalamenti [...] "contributes an {{extraordinary}} score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," [...] but stated that Lynch [...] "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end." [...] A general criticism from U.S. critics was Blue Velvets often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness {{as a work of}} art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as [...] "convincing and courageous" [...] but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: [...] "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." [...] While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of Blue Velvet remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|Australia won the toss. The match {{began in}} damp conditions, {{and before the}} pitch began to dry, at which point it would become {{extremely}} difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike {{the ball out of}} the ground. MacLaren commented: [...] "I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?" [...] The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren {{at the edge of the}} field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren [...] "later spent much breath defending himself on this point"; although it is not clear how Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had [...] "thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [...] ". Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: [...] "This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat." [...] Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.|$|E

2500|$|Christian worship by {{the sixth}} century had {{developed}} a clear belief in the intercession of saints. This belief was also influenced by a concept of hierarchy of sanctity, with [...] the Trinity at its pinnacle, followed by the Virgin Mary, referred to in Greek as the Theotokos ("birth-giver of God") or Meter Theou ("Mother of God"), the saints, living holy men, women, and spiritual elders, followed {{by the rest of}} humanity. Thus, in order to obtain blessings or divine favour, early Christians would often pray or <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> intermediary, such as the saints or the Theotokos, or living fellow Christians believed to be holy, to intercede on their behalf with Christ. A strong sacramentality and belief in the importance of physical presence also joined the belief in intercession of saints with the use of relics and holy images (or icons) in early Christian practices.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, on most simple test {{questions}} such as [...] "Who is the girl pulling?" [...] or [...] "What is the red box on?" [...] Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful. Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no deixis or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing how much trouble the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year people stopped asking her to produce these questions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a pair of}} cases, the Seventh Circuit {{has dealt}} with {{how and when to}} {{instruct}} a jury that is given the Mt. Healthy test to apply. In Greenberg v.

Frank Easterbrook observed in 1992's Gooden v. Neal, where a correctional officer alleged he had been demoted in retaliation for exposing corruption, that [...] "any defendants do not want Mt. Healthy instructions and prefer to <b>ask</b> <b>an</b> either-or question of the jury" [...] since they also contend the activity the adverse action was in retaliation for was not protected by the First Amendment. [...] "Mt. Healthy is something of a misfit in such circumstances." [...] In that case, where the employer denied that the plaintiff's speech was in any way related to the adverse decision, the chose to shift the burden of proof of that to the employer as well, an approach Donald P. Lay of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation, criticized at length in dissent. In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the test still applies when a plaintiff presents only a circumstantial case that the adverse action was retaliatory as opposed to a direct one.|$|E
