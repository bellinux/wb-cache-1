5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against <b>a</b> <b>tavern</b> keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for <b>a</b> <b>tavern</b> or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that <b>a</b> <b>tavern</b> keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{settled in}} the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} by approximately 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. Ebenezer Hibbard was an early European settler on the creek, living there by 1772. The creek is named after a person with the surname of Solomon, who settled {{at the mouth of}} the creek in 1774. In the early 1800s, Europeans first realized the natural resources of the watershed. In the early 1800s, there was <b>a</b> <b>tavern</b> called Inman's Tavern and several cabins in the Solomon Gap. In the mid-1800s, the population of the watershed increased significantly due to coal mining and timbering opportunities.
