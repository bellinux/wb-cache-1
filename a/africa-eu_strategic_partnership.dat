30|$|By {{recognizing}} {{the climate change}} challenges as a foreign policy concern, the EU came to the realization then that it would effectively advance its climate change policy agendas on a global level if it engaged Africa as a strategic partner via enhanced political dialogue. This {{is in contrast to}} the uncooperative stance that the United States government has taken against the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This realization resulted in an enhanced Africa-EU Partnership on climate change, drafted into the 2007 joint-Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) document. Thus, this would be the instrument that both continents would use in their cooperation to tackle their energy security challenges and environmental concerns, among which the climate change is of the highest priority. The <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Partnership</b> and a Joint Africa-EU Strategy document came about as a reaction to what Europe and Africa perceived to be a solution for the new threats and issues that required joint responses and coordinated efforts based on common vision and shared interests.|$|E
40|$|The Joint <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Partnership</b> and Action Plan {{was adopted}} in Lisbon in 2007. This new strategy, {{which is often}} {{referred}} to as a ‘people-centred partnership’, was launched with the purpose of scaling-up political dialogue between the African Union (AU) and the EU in the interests of building a solid and sustainable continent-to-continent partnership. It aims to reinvigorate and elevate cooperation between Africa and Europe in the fight against poverty, injustice, human rights violations, lawlessness, insecurity and political and social instability. The priorities of the partnership programme are organised around eight themes: peace and security; democratic governance and human rights; trade, regional integration and infrastructure; the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); energy; climate change; migration, mobility and employment; and science, information society and space. The programme stipulates that Africa and the EU will pursue and implement policies and programmes that facilitate the active involvement of diaspora communities in the implementation of the strategy...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the EU and Africa {{adopted a}} {{comprehensive}} strategic partnership {{to reflect the}} changing nature of their relationship in the new world era. Since then, {{the relationship between the two}} partners has deepened in a number of significant areas ranging from peace and security, human rights and governance, migrations, trade, climate change to regional integration. While this new phase in Africa-EU relations faces important challenges due, inter alia, to Africa 2 ̆ 7 s dependency; it also points towards the possibility of a substantive transformation based on a shared vision of interdependencies between Europe and Africa. The paper will assess the significance of <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> against the backdrop of historical relations between the two partners and in light of the transformative dynamics affecting world politics today. I will argue, in substance, that the liberal nature of the European Union project on the one hand, and the pan-African ethos of the African Union on the other have the potential to overcoming some of the historical shortcomings that have defined and dominated Africa-Europe relations for the past sixty years...|$|E

3000|$|In {{addition}} to seeking partners multilaterally as mentioned-earlier, the EU and Africa have also entered into bilateral joint strategic partnerships {{in order to}} enhance their political dialogue and deal with what they call issues of mutual concerns such as the climate change challenges. A case in point is the EU engagement in Africa through the <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Partnership</b> on Climate Change and Environment and the support that the EU explicitly extends to the Climate for development in Africa program referred to as ClimDev Africa. This is an African initiative that seeks to make required information on climate change available to all African decision makers. Although the climate change challenge is no longer disputed by any country in the world, though the way to go about adapting to it and mitigating its effects and fully accepting its historic responsibility differs, the reality is that countries enter negotiations on climate change based on their national economic and security interests. That is so because countries in general base their climate change negotiation strategies on domestic interests driven by powerful stakeholders and local realities. This in effect is the reason why the United States government was lukewarm about the Kyoto Protocol and the Congress refused to ratify it. And as a consequence of that, former President Bush decided to withdraw the US from the parties of the Kyoto Protocol. Viewing this situation and understanding the politics of the International Climate Change Regime negotiations, one may be inclined to think that the leading countries in the EU, the US, Canada, China, India and other emerging powers as well as the African group on climate change negotiations and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands States representations should maybe focus on less contentious issues, and expend more energy and efforts onto the areas where divergence of positions are less considerable; i.e., the so-called `low-hanging fruit.´ [...]...|$|E

40|$|Bilateral <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{between the}} European Union (EU) and major global actors are an {{emerging}} feature of EU foreign policy. This chapter reviews the ongoing academic and policy debates {{on the concept}} and practice of <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships,</b> highlighting the considerable scepticism surrounding their development. It goes on to argue that, despite their flaws, <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> are an important and multi-purpose tool in the EU foreign policy arsenal, potentially fulfilling reflexive, relational and structural goals at once. Based on this original analytical perspective, the chapter suggests that <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> are those that help pave the way from bilateral transactions to cooperation in broader mini-lateral and multilateral formats. After reviewing the performance of EU <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> at these three levels of analysis, and delivering a sobering but not dismissive picture of their output to date, the chapter addresses {{the connection between the}} EU discourse on <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> and policy-making in the postLisbon institutional context. It detects piecemeal progress in agenda-setting and representation but exposes a serious deficit of coordination among EU bodies and with member states, which as yet prevents the EU from devising an integrated approach to its <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships.</b> SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|When the EU and South Africa acceded to a <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership,</b> they {{expanded}} into new areas of partnership. One {{of these areas}} was peace and security, which {{is the focus of}} this article. The article argues that although {{there appears to be a}} shared understanding of what security means, the <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> has not been utilised significantly to further this understanding in practice. This is largely due to the EU’s preferences for a continental, multilateral approach over the bilateralism of a <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership.</b> At the same time, South Africa sees its <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> with the EU as being outside of its broader commitment to regional security. As a result the peace and security element of the <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> has not been leveraged effectively despite several entry points for action. The article thus concludes that both the EU and South Africa need to re-think the current arrangement...|$|R
