5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the costs <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

Many countries are currently considering how to manage carbon rights <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> sharing issues, including Cambodia and Kenya. Both of these countries host existing forest carbon projects and are also in the process of designing national REDD+ programmes. This article uses a conceptual framework for carbon rights <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> sharing derived from legal analysis to consider the cases of both Cambodia and Kenya, and also includes a general discussion of the challenges countries might encounter when considering how to manage carbon rights <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> sharing in the context of REDD+ implementation...|$|R

Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing.

40|$|Stakeholder risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> {{perceptions}} <b>and</b> {{attitudes towards}} a technology {{matter for the}} societal response to these technologies. This is especially the case for technological innovations where the public has no direct experience with the technology and its applications. In such cases, expert views are the main source for public opinion formation. Stakeholder risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception, <b>and</b> their effect on attitudes towards a new technology (nanotechnology) and its applications were examined in two studies. In a survey, the effect of risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception on attitudes to nanotechnology in specific application domains (energy, water, food and medicine) was examined. While risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception predicted much {{of the variance in}} attitude, experts were more positive about medicine applications and more negative about food applications than could be explained through risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception. In the second study, expert focus groups were asked for reasons why food and medicine were seen as more negative and positive than based on the risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perceptions as measured in the survey. For medicine, the urgency and unique potential of nanotechnology was seen as a reason as why this domain was liked more. For food, the high level of uncertainty about risk assessment and about exposure of consumers and the lack of urgency in applying nanotechnology to food was seen as a reason this domain was liked less. In addition, experts voiced concern about potential negative public response to food applications as reasons for their negative attitude. These results thus suggest that both risk <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception consist of multiple dimensions that require further exploration...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
