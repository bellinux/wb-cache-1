The work is aimed at the calculated-experimental investigation of the corrosion process and carbon steel passivating in the desalted water stream with different content of the dissolved gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia) at temperatures up to 600 K, pressures 1 and 200 atm anl in initial stage during 6. 5 h. The following methods and equipment have been used: electron-diffraction examination, Auger-electron spectroscopy, gravimetry, spectrophotometry, EP- 100 electron diffractometer, Auger-spectrometer "Balzers". First, the phase composition and thickness of the oxide films on the steel forming in the conditions modelling the hot water-oxygen treatment (HWOT) have been determined; the character and speed of the acid corrosion during initial 6. 5 h have been investigated and determined. First, the experimental data on the carbon <b>acid</b> <b>steel</b> at HWOT have been obtained that permits to optimize HWOT regime by a establishing the necessary pH water values.

Four different alkylphosphonic acids exhibiting alkyl chain of various size were synthesized and studied: butylphosphonic acid (C 4 P), octylphosphonic acid (C 8 P), decylphosphonic acid (C 10 P), and hexadecylphosphonic acid (C 16 P). Electrochemistry experiments were extensively {{carried out in}} order to determine electrochemical surface blocking of adsorbed layers in function of grafting time. In term of surface blocking, an 8 h modification time was optimal for all alkylphosphonic acids. Longer immersion times lead to degradation of adsorbed layers. For the first time, grafting of C 16 P was studied under high frequency ultrasound irradiation. Interestingly, grafting process is highly accelerated under sonication and well-covering C 16 P modified substrates are obtained after 1 h of immersion under ultrasound irradiation. This would allow to elaborate high-quality alkylphosphonic acids modified samples within much shorter times.

50|$|The {{application}} of phosphate coatings {{makes use of}} phosphoric acid and {{takes advantage of the}} low solubility of phosphates in medium or high pH solutions. Iron, zinc or manganese phosphate salts are dissolved in a solution of phosphoric <b>acid.</b> When <b>steel</b> or iron parts are placed in the phosphoric acid, a classic acid and metal reaction takes place which locally depletes the hydronium (H3O+) ions, raising the pH, and causing the dissolved salt to fall out of solution and be precipitated on the surface.

In the case of depositing zinc phosphate or manganese phosphate the additional iron phosphate is frequently an undesirable addition to the coating.|$|R

5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of <b>acid</b> pickled <b>steel</b> strip primarily because acid pickling imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not.

Although the steel strip is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some residual amount of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen.

40|$|An {{efficient}} CO 2 capture {{process has}} been developed by integrating calcium looping (CaL) and waste recycling technologies into iron and steel production. A key advantage of such a process is that CO 2 capture is accompanied by simultaneous iron and CaO recycling from waste steel slag. High-purity CaO-based CO 2 sorbents, with CaO content as high as 90 wt%, were prepared easily via <b>acid</b> extraction of <b>steel</b> slag using acetic <b>acid.</b> The <b>steel</b> slag-derived CO 2 sorbents exhibited better CO 2 reactivity and slower (linear) deactivation than commercial CaO during calcium looping cycles. Importantly, the recycling efficiency of iron from steel slag with an acid extraction is improved significantly due to a simultaneous increase in the recovery of iron-rich materials and the iron content of the materials recovered. High-quality iron ore with iron content of 55. 1 – 70. 6 % has been recovered from waste slag in this study. Although costing nearly six {{times as much as}} naturally derived CaO in the purchase of feedstock, the final cost of the steel slag-derived, CaO-based sorbent developed is compensated by the byproducts recovered, i. e., high-purity CaO, high-quality iron ore, and acetone. This could reduce the cost of the steel slag-derived CO 2 sorbent to 57. 7 € t− 1, appreciably lower than that of the naturally derived CaO. The proposed integrated CO 2 capture process using steel slag-derived, CaO-based CO 2 sorbents developed appears to be cost-effective and promising for CO 2 abatement from the iron and steel industry...|$|R
