50|$|<b>A</b> <b>graded</b> module {{is defined}} {{similarly}} (see below for the precise definition). It generalizes <b>graded</b> vector spaces. <b>A</b> <b>graded</b> module {{that is also}} <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> ring is called <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> algebra. <b>A</b> <b>graded</b> ring could also be viewed as <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> Z-algebra.|$|R
50|$|Example: <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> ring is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> module over itself. An ideal in <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> ring is {{homogeneous}} if {{and only}} if it is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> submodule. The annihilator of <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> module is <b>a</b> homogeneous ideal.|$|R
50|$|Remark: To give <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> {{morphism}} from <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> ring to <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> {{ring with}} the image lying in the center {{is the same as}} to give the structure of <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> algebra to the latter ring.|$|R

5|$|Travelling north, the old Town Hall {{building}} at Sunderland Road is <b>a</b> <b>Grade</b> II listed building.

The five piers and lamp-holders guarding the town hall are also Grade II listed. The Brandling Junction railway building, now an urban studies centre, has been restored and is also <b>a</b> <b>Grade</b> II listed building.

5000|$|A {{morphism}} [...] between <b>graded</b> modules, called <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> morphism, is <b>a</b> morphism {{of underlying}} modules that respects grading; i.e., [...] <b>A</b> <b>graded</b> submodule is <b>a</b> submodule that is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> module in own right and {{such that the}} set-theoretic inclusion is <b>a</b> morphism of <b>graded</b> modules. Explicitly, <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> module N is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> submodule of M {{if and only if}} it is a submodule of M and satisfies [...] The kernel and the image of <b>a</b> morphism of <b>graded</b> modules are graded submodules.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> Lie algebra is a Lie algebra {{endowed with}} a {{gradation}} which {{is compatible with}} the Lie bracket. In other words, <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> Lie algebra is a Lie algebra which is also <b>a</b> nonassociative <b>graded</b> algebra under the bracket operation. A choice of Cartan decomposition endows any semisimple Lie algebra with the structure of <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> Lie algebra. Any parabolic Lie algebra is also <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> Lie algebra.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} graded almost prime submod-ules under localizations by introducing a new definition, their character-izations and their properties. Let G be an abelian group with identity e, R be a G−graded commutative ring and M <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> R−module. <b>A</b> proper <b>graded</b> submodule N of M is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> almost prime if for r ∈ h(R) and m ∈ h(M), rm ∈ N − (N: M) N implies r ∈ (N: M) or m ∈ N. <b>A</b> proper <b>graded</b> submodule is <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> weakly prime submod-ule if for r ∈ h(R) and m ∈ h(M), 0 = rm ∈ N implies r ∈ (N: M) or m ∈ N. Every graded prime submodule is graded weakly prime as well as graded almost prime. However, since { 0 } is always <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> weakly prime submodule and hence <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> almost prime submod-ule. <b>A</b> <b>graded</b> almost prime submodule need not be <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> prime submodule...|$|R
