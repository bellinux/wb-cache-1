The difficulty for modellers is that the detail and subtlety embodied in {{a wide array of}} policy interventions means that some simplification is appealing, but no meaningful general propositions exist in the theoretical literature as to the sign or size of the differences in predicted effects. All that can seemingly be done is to investigate the differences case by case, but even here the findings are sensitive both to the particular form of model used as well as the model parameterization employed. As a result, there is relatively little in the literature that provides guidance as to how serious the pitfalls may be, and how misleading ad valorem tariff equivalent treatment is. Here I draw on three examples of numerical modelling where explicit representation of policy interventions are used. The picture that emerges is one of large quantitative and even qualitative differences in predicted impacts. These examples suggest that where interventions differ from a tariff, ad valorem representation should be undertaken in numerical trade modelling only with substantial caveats. ...|$|E

The reason for this seems to be that administrators were convinced that is was not possible to raise sufficient revenue in any other way.

40|$|Quantifying the restrictiveness of NTMs for {{services}} {{has proven to}} be difficult. The main limitation has been the lack of comprehensive data, whether trade, policy, or microeconomic data. A first solution is to use a STRI approach whereby qualitative information is arbitrarily transformed into a quantitative measure of the restrictiveness of each measure. We use here a reduced form of the gravity approach to estimate services trade without relying on STRI information. Our results compare with those of Fontagné, Guillin, and Mitaritonna (2011) for the year 2004. We use the same method, for a larger set of countries. The tariff equivalents are inferred by comparing the inward multilateral resistance term for each country with that of a benchmark country.

For this, we analyze Indonesia's imports because Indonesia not only reduced MFN rates for {{a significant number of}} products but also raised those rates for a large number of other products in 2010. The analysis results indicate asymmetric tariff pass-through: trade prices decrease when MFN rates decline but do not change when these rates rise. Furthermore, examining the effects of changes in MFN rates on product quality and quality-adjusted prices separately, we find that a decrease in trade prices when MFN rates decline is led by a reduction in (average) product quality. In addition, we find that controlling for the change in <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>equivalent</b> rates, a change in tariffs from ad valorem form to specific form does not have any additional impact on import prices...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{adoption}} of the Trade Facilitation Agreement by WTO members in 2014 renewed the global impetus to ease the movement of goods. Developing countries in Sub Saharan Africa have joined the global community in this regard. It has been noted that although tariffs in developing countries have been lowered, numerous non-tariff barriers and non-tariff measures are stifling trade. Cumbersome border processes have added avoidable costs to trade. In this study, we examine the challenges being faced in Zimbabwe in the transboundary movement of goods. The study makes use the World Bank database on Trading Across Border, Logistics Performance Indicators, and the <b>Ad</b> <b>Valorem</b> <b>Equivalent</b> by the World Bank's Economic and Social Community for Asia and Pacific. The data is compared with South Africa, Zambia, OECD High Income Countries, and East Asia. The findings show that, {{it is a huge}} challenge to move goods in Zimbabwe. In other words, doing business with Zimbabwe is not for the faint at heart. These challenges emanate from exorbitant administrative fees, high document requirements, and time delay constraints. These costly non-tariff barriers present a costly murky trade protectionism. The entire logistics chain and infrastructure system need to be revamped to improve reliability and minimise trade costs. When compared to <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>equivalent,</b> Zimbabwe trade costs with South Africa and Zambia in agriculture are in excess of 100 %, while those for the manufactured goods average 65 %. The high trade costs in agriculture are high mainly due to excess requirements in terms of processes and procedures to move goods across borders. Combining trade costs data with specific knowledge on trade facilitation, logistics and trade policy will provide a comprehensive diagnosis that will help to prioritize reform packages that carry maximum impact. In light of these findings, the research recommends to customs officials and government policy makers, areas to address in the entire trade facilitation process that will bring huge impact in terms of removal of border inefficiencies, minimising of trade costs, and improvement of the logistics chain. These recommendations range from the establishment of single window system, integrated border management, and one stop border posts as part of the entire process under trade facilitation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Relating the {{collected}} customs {{duty to the}} value of imports enables the estimation of a rate of applied duty that takes into account all pricing components and their use. Indeed, this <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>equivalent</b> integrates the complex dimensions of customs duties, the measures of exemption and suspension, and those concerning preferential regimes. Processing collected duties for all the products reveals that the 1. 5 per cent rate of duty actually applied in 2003 is the same for the EU and the US. Nevertheless, it appears that the US taxes more the least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries than does the EU. Thus, setting aside those products which enter free of duty, the rate of taxation applied by the US is 15 per cent and 6. 2 per cent respectively with regards to LDCs and developing countries, whereas in the EU it is only 3. 7 per cent and 4. 1 per cent. In the US market the sectors that are the most highly taxed upon importation are textiles, apparel and clothing, cotton and articles of leather, whereas in the EU it is more agricultural and food products (fruits and preserves, meats, sugars and cereals).

40|$|The methodological {{problems}} associated with standard partial equilibrium models may impart a significant bias in their projections of the trade effects of tariff cuts. First, these models fail {{to account for the}} price-raising effects of nontariff barriers (NTBs) that shift the supply curve for imports. This causes the percentage price change associated with any cut in import duties to be overstated, which in turn produces an upward bias in projections of new trade resulting from those cuts. Second, this problem of the interaction of tariffs and NTBs, and the failure to consider the influence of supply constraints, can cause major upward biases in simulation of trade diversion due to preferential tariffs. Using representative estimates of supply elasticities and NTB <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>equivalents,</b> this paper shows that the magnitude of this bias may reach several hundred percent or more. It suggests procedures for removing biases in models used to simulate the effects of tariffs and nontariff barriers in international trade.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of {{different}} aspects of trade facilitation in developed and developing countries through an augmented gravity model and uses the latter to estimate <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>equivalents</b> (AVEs) of administrative barriers to trade. Trade facilitation is defined as measures that aim at making international trade easier by eliminating administrative delays, simplifying commercial procedures, increasing transparency, security and incorporating new technologies in trade. I use a two-step analysis to do this. First, I precisely determine the predicted time related to trade facilitation aspects using the Doing Business database (World Bank). Then, the predicted time to export and to import are introduced in the gravity model and its outcome is used to estimate AVEs of the administrative barriers to trade. The results show that internet, bureaucracy, corruption and geographic variables significantly affect the transaction time to import and to export. Time to import has a higher negative impact on trade than that to export. When sectoral characteristics are taken into account, some perishable (food and beverages), seasonal (wearing apparels) and high-value added products {{appear to be more}} sensitive to transaction time than other products.
