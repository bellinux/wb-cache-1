5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and <b>actinolite</b> that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E

25|$|Nephrite {{consists}} of a microcrystalline interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium, magnesium-iron rich amphibole mineral series tremolite (calcium-magnesium)-ferroactinolite (calcium-magnesium-iron). The middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called <b>actinolite</b> (the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos). The higher the iron content, the greener the colour.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} {{remarkable}} in the geology of Choongtam: {{the base of}} the hill consists of the clay and mica slates overlain by gneiss, generally dipping to the eastward; in the latter are granite veins, containing fine tourmalines. <b>Actinolites</b> are found in some highly metamorphic gneisses, brought by landslips from the neighbouring heights. The weather in May was cloudy and showery, but the rain which fell was far less in amount than that at Dorjiling: during the day the sun's power was great; but though it rose between five and six a.m., it never appeared above the lofty peaked mountains that girdle the valley till eight a.m. Dark pines crest the heights around, and landslips score their flanks with white seams below; while streaks of snow remain throughout the month at 9000 feet above; and everywhere silvery torrents leap down to the Lachen and Lachoong.|$|R
40|$|The D/H, 18 O/ 16 O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr {{ratios of}} the basaltic {{basement}} from the Leg 83 section of DSDP Hole 504 B {{show that in}} that area the oceanic crust has experienced intensive but not pervasive alteration. Isotope ratios of the basalts are very heterogeneous because of an input of oxygen, hydrogen, and strontium from seawater. The hydrogen isotopic composition of many samples displays the complete thermal history of the water-rock interactions. High-temperature mineral formations (<b>actinolites,</b> epidotes, and chlorites) were overgrown by a mineralization at lower temperatures (mixedlayer smectites, iddingsites, and smectites) during successive stages of cooling of the oceanic crust by cold seawater. From 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data bulk water/rock ratios up to 5 : 1 have been calculated. There is evidence that some primary minerals like high-An plagioclases contain oxygen from altered basalts. We have discussed the probability that there existed a seawater/crust interface, now {{at a depth of}} 620 m sub-basement, during the high-temperature water/rock interactions. This interface was covered during later magmatism by thick flows, pillow lavas, and intrusives...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{necessary}} {{conditions for}} optical pleochroism in orthopyroxenes are: ordering of Fe 2 + ions, with preferential occupation of M S positions; presence of small, high-valence ations (A 13 +, Fe 3 +, Ti 4 +} in M 1 positions; replacement ofSi by A 1; and a sufficient Fe 2 + content. These factors favour an intensification of the charge-transfer absorption bands in the ultra-violet hat is more marked for the a vibration direction than for fl and ~. This leads to absorption i {{the blue and}} a red colour in transmitted a-polarized light, while fl and ~, remain green. T WO distinctive features of minerals are the properties of colour and pleochroism of crystals in thin section. In many cases, the origins of colour and, in particular, pleochroism in silicates have not been explained. Measurements of polarized absorption spectra of minerals can, however, yield information {{on the origins of}} colour and pleochroism (Burns, 1965). Most ferromagnesian silicates (olivines, orthopyroxenes, clino-pyroxenes, cummingtonites, <b>actinolites,</b> pigeonites) are distinctly pleochroic in the short-wave infra-red region (7000 - 14 000 A), but th...|$|R

25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape.

2500|$|Amphiboles {{have great}} {{variability}} in chemistry, described variously as a [...] "mineralogical garbage can" [...] or a [...] "mineralogical shark swimming {{a sea of}} elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the 12−; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group (−), although it can {{be replaced by a}} fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion. Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+. Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis; amphibole asbestos (anthophyllite, tremolite, <b>actinolite,</b> grunerite, and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos.|$|E

50|$|<b>Actinolite</b> is an {{intermediate}} member in a solid-solution series between magnesium-rich tremolite, Ca2(Mg5.0-4.5Fe2+0.0-0.5)Si8O22(OH)2, and iron-rich ferro-actinolite, ☐Ca2(Mg2.5-0.0Fe2+2.5-5.0)Si8O22(OH)2. Mg and Fe ions can be freely exchanged in the crystal structure. Like tremolite, asbestiform <b>actinolite</b> is regulated as asbestos.|$|E
50|$|Greenschist, {{as a rock}} type, {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of the minerals chlorite and <b>actinolite</b> and may contain albite or epidote.Greenschist often has a lepidoblastic, nematoblastic or schistose texture defined primarily by chlorite and <b>actinolite.</b> Greenschists often have some foliation resulting in mineral alignment, especially of chlorite and actinolite.Grain size is rarely coarse, due primarily to the mineral assemblage. Chlorite {{and to a lesser extent}} <b>actinolite</b> typically exhibit small, flat or acicular crystal habits.|$|E
50|$|Uralites are {{particular}} hydrothermally altered pyroxenites; during autogenic hydrothermal circulation {{their primary}} mineralogy of pyroxene and plagioclase, etc. has altered to <b>actinolite</b> and saussurite (albite + epidote). The texture is distinctive, the pyroxene altered to fuzzy, radially arranged <b>actinolite</b> pseudomorphically after pyroxene, and saussuritised plagioclase.|$|E

50|$|Ferroactinolite prisms {{are much}} darker in color than <b>actinolite</b> due to higher iron content {{affecting}} opacity, {{but may be}} dark green in thin slices or around the edges. The crystals are brittle with a hardness of 5-6 on the Mohs scale and a white streak. It is pleochroic and has a higher refractive indices and surface relief than <b>actinolite.</b>|$|E

50|$|Amphibole class fibers are needle-like. Amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, {{anthophyllite}} and <b>actinolite</b> {{are members}} of the amphibole class.|$|E
50|$|Metavolcanic rock {{can contain}} the {{minerals}} quartz, feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene. Less common minerals can include biotite, garnet, <b>actinolite,</b> epidote, chalcedony, prehnite, and wodginite.|$|E
50|$|Some {{forms of}} <b>actinolite</b> {{are used as}} gemstones. One is nephrite, {{one of the two}} types of jade (the other being jadeite, a variety of pyroxene).|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, for an (ortho)amphibolite to be classed as a {{metamorphic}} amphibolite, it must {{be certain}} that the amphibole in the rock is a prograde metamorphic product, and not a retrograde metamorphic product. For instance, <b>actinolite</b> amphibole is a common product of retrograde metamorphism of basalts at (upper) greenschist facies conditions. Often, this will take on the crystal form and habit of the original protolith assemblage; <b>actinolite</b> pseudomorphically replacing pyroxene {{is an indication that}} the amphibolite may not represent a peak metamorphic grade in the amphibolite facies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Actinolite</b> is {{commonly}} found in metamorphic rocks, such as contact aureoles surrounding cooled intrusive igneous rocks. It also occurs {{as a product of}} metamorphism of magnesium-rich limestones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Actinolite</b> schists {{are often}} the result of {{hydrothermal}} alteration or metasomatism, and thus may not, necessarily, be a good indicator of metamorphic conditions when taken in isolation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from the green hue {{imparted}} by the colour of the metamorphic minerals within the mafic rocks: the typical green minerals are chlorite, <b>actinolite,</b> and other green amphiboles.|$|E
5000|$|Tremolite-actinolite root name: <b>actinolite</b> Ca2(Mg,Fe2+)5(Si8O22)(OH)2 (1794, IMA 2012 s.p. Rd), ferro-actinolite Ca2(Fe2+,Mg)5(OH)2|Si8O22 (1946, IMA 1997 s.p. Rd, IMA 2012 s.p. Rd), {{tremolite}} Ca2Mg5(OH)2|Si8O22 (1789, IMA 1997 s.p. Rd, IMA 2012 s.p. Rd) ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{a general}} field petrologic term for {{metamorphic}} or altered mafic volcanic rock. A greenstone is sometimes a greenschist but can also be rock types without any schistosity, especially metabasalt (spilite or picrite). The green is due to abundant green chlorite, <b>actinolite</b> and epidote minerals that dominate the rock. However, basalts may remain quite black if primary pyroxene does not revert to chlorite or <b>actinolite.</b> To qualify for the name a rock must also exhibit schistosity or some foliation or layering. The rock is derived from basalt, gabbro or similar rocks containing sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar, chlorite, epidote and quartz.|$|E
