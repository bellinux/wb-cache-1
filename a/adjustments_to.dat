After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small <b>adjustments</b> <b>to</b> the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor <b>adjustments</b> <b>to</b> the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E

5000|$|The {{abstract}} of a 2012 meta-analysis by Credé and Niehorster (k = 237, N = 44,668) reads: [...] "The review, {{based on}} studies using the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire, is organized around three primary themes: (1) {{the structure of}} students’ <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college, (2) the relationship of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college constructs with possible antecedents and correlates, and (3) the relationship of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college constructs with college grades and college retention. Meta-analytic results indicate that <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of college retention. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students’ relationships with their parents. Weaker relationships are evident with demographic variables, prior achievement, coping approaches, and variables that reflect students’ psychological independence from their parents.

40|$|To explore older adults’ {{perceptions}} of subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and to analyse the correlational {{structure of the}} pre-categories in our study: subjective age, indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and of personal age perception. An exploratory, descriptive mixed-methods design was utilised. A purposive sampling method was used to select 154 older adults aged between 75 and 99 years from three different nationalities. Semi-structured interviews were performed, addressing two core areas: subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing. Data was subjected to content analysis. Representation of the correlational structure of the precategories in our study (subjective age and indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing) were analysed by a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Standardised instruments measured regular cognitive abilities. Five categories derived from interviews for subjective age: ‘adapted’, ‘disconnected’, ‘old’, ‘youthful’ and ‘tolerant’. A total of seven categories emerged as indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing: ‘social networking’, ‘health’, ‘time perspective’, ‘spirituality’, ‘financial autonomy’, ‘professional activities’ and ‘fulfilment and leisure’. These results supported a model for each pre-category. Subjective age was explained by a two-factor model: ‘age-conscientious’ and ‘youthful’. A three-dimensional model formed by ‘reconciled’, ‘satisficers’ and ‘maximisers’ was indicated as a best-fit solution for <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing. A three-dimensional overall model for PAP was formed by ‘age-cognisant’, ‘fulfilled’ and ‘satisficers’. The findings highlighted the underdeveloped potential of subjective age, <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and a personal age perception overall model for this population. Enhancing subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing might be an important target to improve older adults’ interventions’ outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{tested a}} model in which passion for work predicts {{psychological}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement through the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. With a sample of 103 French-Canadian retirees {{from a variety of}} occupations, the first study used a retrospective cross-sectional design. The second study followed 73 French-Canadian teachers over a 6 -year period and examined the relationship between passion for work, assessed when participants were still working, and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement, measured when participants were retired. All participants completed questionnaires on demographics, passion for work, basic psychological needs and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement. Results from structural equation modeling confirmed the hypothesized model, such that both studies confirmed the mediating role of basic psychological need satisfaction in the passion–psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement relationship. Need satisfaction significantly mediated the relationship between harmonious passion for work and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement in Studies 1 and 2. The mediation was also confirmed between obsessive passion and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement in Study 1, but not in Study 2. These findings suggest that passion for work matters in psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement. Being passionate about work can thus lead to positive or negative outcomes in retirement, depending on whether the passion is harmonious or obsessive, respectively...|$|R

5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight <b>adjustments</b> <b>to</b> the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{summarize}} {{relevant evidence}} investigating the psychologic <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> irreversible vision loss (IVL) in adults. Design: Irreversible vision loss entails a challenging medical {{condition in which}} rehabilitation outcomes are strongly dependent on the patient’s psychologic <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> illness and impairment. So far, no study has systematically reviewed the psychologic <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> IVL in adults. Methods: We reviewed all articles examining the psychologic <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> IVL in adults. We included articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals. We performed a keyword literature search using 4 databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct) for all years through July 2014. We assessed risk of bias of selected studies using the RTI Item Bank for Assessing Risk of Bias and Confounding for Observational Studies of Interventions or Exposures and the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. Results: Of a total of 3948 citations retrieved, we selected 52 eligible studies published between 1946 and 2014. The majority of studies were observational and cross-sectional in nature. Our review suggests that high levels of depression occur during the <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> IVL. Better <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> IVL was associated with greater acceptance of vision loss and use of instrumental coping, good social support, positivity, and use of assistive aids. Conclusions: The overall findings indicate that IVL often has negative effects on patients’ {{quality of life and}} mental health and that such effects tend to remain over time. Specific factors and variables associated with the <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> IVL need to be clarified through further in-depth and longitudinal research...|$|R
