25|$|Both sides {{made two}} changes, with India {{dropping}} Sourav Ganguly and Ajit Agarkar for Zaheer Khan and R. P. Singh, with Agarkar suspected {{to have a}} hamstring injury. India elected to choose five bowlers on what was an excellent batting pitch. This {{is the first time}} that a Test team has fielded three left-arm fast bowlers. Pakistan dropped Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and the ill Mohammad Sami, with Abdul Razzaq and Mohammad Asif coming in. Pakistan won the toss, batting first to reach 4/379 at stumps with Inzamam-ul-Haq & Shahid Afridi approaching centuries, on 79 and 85 respectively. On <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> for bowling, R. P. Singh made a promising debut, taking three wickets.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everything {{about the}} whole setup was fantastic, apart from {{the size of the}} boundaries. It was a little bit farcical. They were just too small. If you bowled to [...] Matthew Hayden or Adam Gilchrist it would be <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> as a spinner. Aside from that, if they can sort it out I couldn't rate it higher. It {{can be one of the}} premier test venues." ...|$|E

Only six golfers remained under-par for the tournament. The scoring average for the field was 73.82, almost four strokes over par.|$|R

2500|$|Stage 4 on Wednesday 24 October 1934 covered [...] was {{the first}} time in which an A Grade rider beat the {{handicap}} to finish first. The original 107 riders were down to 91 at the start, with 9 riders having dropped out overnight. [...] The Argus described it as the perfect handicap with riders from each of the grades in the 29 riders at the finish for the 2 lap sprint around Wangaratta showground. Stuart, who had been leading the championship, broke a pedal and lost more than half an hour. Mithouard won the stage and with Stuart out of contention, took the lead in the championship. [...] It was <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> for leaders as the handicap leader Stubenrauch broke his rear wheel in a fall at Benalla and had to wait over an hour for a replacement. Stubenrauch splintered a bone in his right shoulder, but was somehow able to continue the race.|$|E
2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day,</b> I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first Australian wicket fell {{before a}} run {{was on the}} board {{for the third time}} in the series, but it was Ken Archer who succumbed to Alec Bedser when he glanced the third ball of the day to Denis Compton at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by Umpire Barlow. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and {{composed}} innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] to rest. He made 206 out of Australia's 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh Ashes century in four years, overtaking Victor Trumper and Bill Woodfull placing him behind only Sir Donald Bradman on the list of Australian century-makers against England. No other Australian batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with Lindsay Hassett (43), 110 for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with Keith Miller (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. Alec Bedser returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.|$|E

5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Mets for free agency, Reyes {{continued}} to make his offseason home on Long Island. He had lived in Manhasset, New York with his wife, Katherine, and then moved to Old Brookville. Reyes {{was a close friend}} to former right-handed pitcher José Lima. When Lima died May 23, 2010, Reyes said, [...] "He's the funniest guy you could ever meet, he always smiled, he was always happy. It was good to know him. It's <b>a</b> real <b>tough</b> day...I've known him a long time. People in the Dominican Republic love the guy a lot, so it's <b>a</b> very <b>tough</b> <b>day</b> not only for the Dominican people, but for everyone because of the guy that he was." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kent had <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> rain-affected first <b>day</b> at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury. They {{struggled}} against the bowling of Dai Rushbrook, who took 3 for 25 in 8 overs, and Luke Sellers, who took 2 for 23 in 7. At one point they {{were reduced to}} 86 for 6, before recovering to 104 for 6 in the 30 overs the weather allowed them before close of play on the first day. The next two days of this three day match were then both abandoned because of rain.|$|R

25|$|The 1983 SEM {{team had}} Sean Kelly as team leader and Caritoux soon fitted {{into the role}} of Kelly's main helper in stage races. In 1984, Skil became main team {{sponsors}} (making the Skil-Sem team) and Éric showed that he had potential to be more than just Kelly's helper in the mountains, he started the season by taking the Tour du Haut Var, <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> hilly one <b>day</b> race in the south of France and then won the Orange to Mont Ventoux stage of Paris–Nice. He was then given a short break in early April by his manager as the team concentrated on the spring classics for Sean Kelly, races which did not suit Caritoux.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been about that time when Mary and father, and all what {{had to do with}} them, begun to drop out of my head. But I kep' them two knick-knacks, which was once meant for {{presents}} for her--long after I'd lost all clear notion of ever going back home again, I kep' 'em--from first to last I kep' 'em--I can't hardly say why; unless it was that I'd got so used to keeping of them that I hadn't the heart to let 'em go. Not, mind ye, but what they mightn't now and then have set me thinking of father and Mary at home--at times, you know, when I changed 'em from one bag to another, or took and blew the dust off of 'em, for to keep 'em as nice as I could. But the older I got, the worse I got at calling anything to mind in a clear way about Mary and the old country. There seemed to be a sort of fog rolling up betwixt us now. I couldn't see her face clear, in my own mind, no longer. It come upon me once or twice in dreams, when I nodded alone over my fire after <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>day's</b> march--it come upon me at such times so clear, that it startled me up, all in a cold sweat, wild and puzzled with not knowing at first whether the stars was shimmering down at me in father's paddock at Dibbledean, or in the lonesome places over the sea, hundreds of miles away from any living soul. But that was only dreams, you know. Waking, I was all astray now, whenever I fell a-thinking about father or her. The longer I tramped it over the lonesome places, the thicker that fog got which seemed to have rose up in my mind between me and them I'd left at home. At last, it come to darken in altogether, and never lifted no more, that I can remember, till I crossed the seas again and got back to my own country." ...|$|R
50|$|Watson {{did not get}} off to a fast {{start and}} his even-par 72 opening round was nearly much worse; he was +3 through 14 holes when he began to catch fire, scoring three birdies on the final four holes. On <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> scoring <b>day</b> at Pebble Beach, the 72 put him just two back of first round leaders Bruce Devlin and Bill Rogers. Rogers was the {{defending}} British Open champion and was coming off the best year of his career. Jack Nicklaus opened with a disappointing 74. Nicklaus, though in the declining phase of his career, was considered a strong contender as well: he was a winner (at the time) of 17 professional majors including both the 1980 U.S. Open (where Watson had his best previous U.S. Open finish, third place) and the 1972 U.S. Open (the last U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach). Nicklaus had also finished one shot off the pace at the 1977 PGA Championship, the last professional major held at Pebble, a course he considered perhaps his favorite in the world.|$|R
