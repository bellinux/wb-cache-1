5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These {{are attracted}} by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, and upon <b>alighting</b> {{on the plant}} adhere to the sticky drops of mucilage. Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by splendid fairywren {{males have}} been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so {{named for the}} similarity of movements to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after <b>alighting</b> on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to <b>alighting</b> vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} {{use during}} the Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many <b>alighting</b> at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and <b>alighting.</b> It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before <b>alighting.</b> On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

25|$|To further {{solve the}} problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the {{corporation}} was stipulating two door bus bodies with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and <b>alighting</b> - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out through the front (28').|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} rail companies, non-folding {{bicycles}} were banned from peak-time trains {{to and from}} London. However, these restrictions applied only to cyclists boarding or <b>alighting</b> in the area bounded by Hook, Alton, Guildford, Reading and Dorking.

A crow, however, was the first bird to <b>alight</b> on the pole. A crow was considered bad and so Gat Tayaw and his men moved south and erected another bamboo pole. A beautiful bird <b>alighted</b> on the pole and sang, [...] "Liw, Liw, Liw". Thus the town became Liliw.|$|R

25|$|Despite this, the Ro.43 {{had serious}} problems. Its {{lightweight}} structure {{meant that it}} was too delicate for buoyancy at sea, and it had poor sea-handling qualities. These problems meant that when it was launched it was quite normal not to recover it at sea, forcing the aircraft to return to land before <b>alighting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-quality}} Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems {{also use}} high platforms at station stops to allow fast and efficient level boarding and <b>alighting,</b> but potentially leaving hazardous {{gaps between the}} platforms and the buses. Alignment setups such as Kassel curbs help to reduce platform gaps without requiring time-consuming manual alignment at each BRT station stop.|$|E
25|$|The Light Rail's {{ticketing}} {{is based}} on a proof-of-payment system. Passengers must have a ticket or pass before boarding. Maryland Transit Administration Police officers ride some trains and randomly spot-check passengers {{to make sure that they}} are carrying a valid ticket or pass and can issue criminal citations for those without one. Civilian Fare Inspectors also conduct ticket checks, <b>alighting</b> those without fare.|$|E
