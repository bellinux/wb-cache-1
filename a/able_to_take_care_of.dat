After his victory, Gallienus left Marcian in place and hastily left for Italy, intending to suppress the revolt of his cavalry officer Aureolus.

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

We prove the absence of non-trivial phases for one-band AI free or periodic quantum particle systems in each spatial dimension by inspecting the second equivariant cohomology group which classifies "Real" line bundles. We also show that the classification of "Real" line bundles suffices for the complete classification of AI topological quantum systems in dimension d< 4. In dimension d= 4 the determination of different topological phases (for free or periodic systems) is fixed by the second "Real Chern class which provides an even labeling identifiable with the degree of a suitable map.

Otium {{is an example of}} the usage of the term [...] "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war. In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (i.e., winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with otium otiosum (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was otium negotiosum (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying hobby or being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> one's personal affairs or one's own estate.
