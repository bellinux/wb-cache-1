500|$|An {{episode of}} the {{television}} documentary series Horizon titled [...] "Where is Flight MH370?" [...] was broadcast on 17 June 2014 on BBC Two. The programme, narrated by Amanda Drew, documents how the aircraft disappeared, what experts believe happened to it, and how the search has unfolded. The programme also examines new technologies such as flight recorder streaming and <b>automatic</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>surveillance</b> – broadcast (ADS-B), which may help prevent similar disappearances in the future. It concludes by noting that Ocean Shield had spent two months searching [...] of ocean, but that it had searched far {{to the north of}} the Inmarsat [...] "hotspot" [...] on the final arc, at approximately 28 degrees south, where the aircraft was most likely to have crashed. On 8 October 2014, a modified version of the Horizon programme was broadcast in the US by PBS as an episode of Nova, titled [...] "Why Planes Vanish", with a different narrator.|$|E

2500|$|The Microprocessor-En Route Automated Radar Tracking System (MEARTS) is a radar {{processing}} system implemented with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, {{for use in}} the Anchorage, Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and Center Radar Approach Control (CERAPs) environments.

40|$|Aircrews submit {{trajectory}} change {{requests to}} {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to better achieve the operator's preferred business trajectory. Requests are currently made with limited information and are often denied because the change is not compatible with traffic. Also, request opportunities can be overlooked {{due to lack of}} automation that advises aircrews of trajectory changes that improve flight time, fuel burn, and other objectives. The Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) concept leverages <b>Automatic</b> <b>Dependent</b> Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) <b>surveillance</b> information to advise the aircrew of beneficial trajectory changes that are probed for traffic compatibility prior to issuing the request to ATC. This document describes the features, benefits, and limitations of TASAR automation hosted on an Electronic Flight Bag. TASAR has two modes: (1) auto mode that continuously assesses opportunities for improving the performance of the flight and (2) manual mode that probes trajectory changes entered by aircrews for conflicts and performance objectives. The roles and procedures of the aircrew and ATC remain unchanged under TASAR...|$|R

40|$|Several recent {{high profile}} mid-air {{collisions}} highlight {{the fact that}} mid-air collisions are a concern for general aviation. Current traffic alerting systems have limited usability in the airport environment where a majority of mid-air collisions occur. A Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerting Application (TSAA) has been developed which uses <b>Automatic</b> <b>Dependent</b> [...] <b>Surveillance</b> [...] Broadcast (ADS-B), a Global Positioning System (GPS) based surveillance system, to provide reliable alerts in a condensed environment. TSAA {{was designed to be}} compatible with general aviation operations. It was specifically designed to enhance situation awareness and provide traffic alerting. The system does not include guidance or resolution advisories. In addition, the design was consistent with established standards, previous traffic alerting system precedents, as well as air traffic control precedent. Taking into account the potential financial burden associated with installation of a multi-function display (MFD), an audio based TSAA system was also designed to account for constrained cockpit space and added cost of a MFD. TSAA System performance & basic usability was tested using human in the loop studies using a total of 50 general aviation pilots. The studies also evaluated a number of design issues in order to provide recommendation for the final TSAA design. The system was found to be usable and generally effective for all of the encounter scenarios analyzed in both the audio-only and display systems. Performance was significantly improved in the enroute scenarios when a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) was available compared with aural alerts only. In most cases, pilots became aware and responded to traffic earlier when a display was available. Miss distance also increased. Analysis of the audio only system showed that performance improved when alerts were provided to the pilot when compared to performance without a traffic system for a head-on case highlighting the benefit of TSAA. Performance analysis of the final TSAA design showed that 98. 7 % of all collisions were avoided when TSAA was used. The 1. 3 % of collisions that did occur were due to the pilots' conscience decision to disregard an alert. The TSAA system was evaluated for functionality and usability. The findings of these studies will contribute to TSAA standards development for the FAA and design recommendations for the avionics manufacturers. by Sathya Samurdhi Silva. Thesis (S. M.)
