50|$|There {{are three}} main types of sleeve valves: inline, <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> and {{downflow}} pattern. Inline sleeve valve {{can be installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. Inline sleeve valve have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> sleeve valve is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. <b>Angle</b> <b>pattern</b> sleeve valves employ a similar design as the inline sleeve valve by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. Downflow pattern sleeve valves are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, stilling wells or tanks. Unlike inline and <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> the discharge of a downflow pattern is outward and is not contained by the valve itself.|$|E
50|$|With David Akers' ensuing kickoff {{going into}} the end zone for a touchback, {{virtually}} everyone watching assumed the game had finally been decided. However, the Giants had one more play, and Jim Fassel called 86 Lambuth Special - a hook and lateral play named after Ron Dixon's number and the small college in Tennessee he attended, and a play the Giants hadn't even practiced since training camp. Kerry Collins dropped back and threw to Tiki Barber on an <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> over the middle, who then acted as he was going right. However, Barber then abruptly lateraled the ball to Dixon, who cut to the left sideline. To the shock of nearly all watching, Dixon took off down the sideline and appeared to have a chance at a touchdown. However upon reaching field goal range he began running out of room, and safety Damon Moore averted disaster for the Eagles by knocking Dixon out of bounds just 6 yards short of the end zone. The relieved Eagles then celebrated their NFC East title and the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention.|$|E
30|$|Near-field electrospinning {{is a novel}} {{technology}} that is able to realize three-dimensional micro/nanostructures from the controlled fiber stacking. However, due to the developed tension during the electrospinning, it was difficult in patterning the sharp-edged structure. In this study, the sharp-edged 3 D microstructure was successfully electrospun by using the enhanced electric field from the printed conductive pattern on paper, and the good stacking condition for electrospun fibers was analyzed through the electric field modeling. The electrospun fiber was stacked well under high electric field conditions as follows: (1) In the linear conductive pattern, when the angle between the conductive pattern and the needle tip is small. That is, when the needle height is low under the same offset condition. (2) At {{the edge of the}} conductive pattern.

30|$|Compared to {{conductive}} {{straight line}} patterns, curves pattern with acute angle {{was known to}} have a higher electric field singularity [13]. In the conductive pattern with the acute angle, the electric field singularity increases gradually from the peripheral to the intersection of the angled pattern. On the other hand, as the angle increases to an obtuse angle, the electric field becomes higher at the edge of peripheral than the intersection point. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} acute-angle conductive pattern, the electric field at the corner pattern is high, but the obtuse angle shows the low electric field at the corner. The effect of electric field on curved patterns was verified by observing the stacks of electrospun fibers on the patterns that were acute, right and obtuse angle-edge. Figure  3 b, c, and d show the images of the electrospun fibers stacked on the conductive pattern with acute, right and obtuse angles. As expected, the fibers in the acute <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> could be perfectly stacked along the pattern due to the high field intensity by the field singularity (Fig.  3 b). The fibers on the right <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> could be stacked along the pattern, but they did not perfectly follow the conductive pattern like on the acute pattern. They stacked toward the slightly inner side of the pattern edge due to the smaller electric field compared to the acute <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> (Fig.  3 c). The fibers formed on the obtuse pattern did not follow up the pattern due to the weaker electric field than the surrounding area (Fig.  3 d).|$|E

40|$|In Energy Dispersive X-Ray {{diffraction}} measurements, {{the estimate}} of momentum transfer q, on which the diffracted intensity depends, should be as accurate as possible. Since q, in turn, depends on both the energy and the scattering angle, an error on the latter due to an incorrect positioning of the sample, to the asymmetric angular spread induced by the collimation slits or, in general, to any uncertainty on the geometric setup, results in an uncertainty on the q value. Here, a new self calibration method to correct such errors, based on a genetic algorithm is presented. It is robust, fast and completely automatic.

[Subjects] The subjects were 10 people who showed an abnormal knee angle change pattern during usual walking. They did not show the so-called double knee action.

The knee angle was measured during gait with an electronic goniometer. We graphed the temporal changes of the knee angle and compared them with the normal gait pattern. [Results] The knee angle gait pattern of six of the 10 subjects improved after application of the tape and became like a normal gait pattern. The changes in the knee angle resulted from a stimulus via the skin, rather than voluntary muscular adjustment, suggesting that the changes may have originated due to differences in reflexive tensile strength. [Conclusion] In normal speed gait, it is suggested that the knee angle was altered such that it exhibited a normal pattern by applying elastic tape to the anterior surface of the thigh.

40|$|International audienceFoot {{intrinsic}} motion originates {{from the}} combination of numerous joint motions giving this segment a high adaptive ability. Existing foot kinematic models are mostly focused on analyzing small scale foot bone to bone motions which require both complex experimental methodology and complex interpretative work to assess the global foot functionality. This study proposes a method to assess the total foot deformation by calculating a helical angle from the relative motions of the rearfoot and the forefoot. This method required {{a limited number of}} retro-reflective markers placed on the foot and was tested for five different movements (walking, forefoot impact running, heel impact running, 90 degrees cutting, and 180 degrees U-turn) and 12 participants. Overtime intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the helical <b>angle</b> <b>pattern</b> repeatability for each movement. Our results indicated that the method was suitable to identify the different motions as different amplitudes of helical angle were observed according to the flexibility required in each movement. Moreover, the results showed that the repeatability could be used to identify the mastering of each motion as this repeatability was high for well mastered movements. Together with existing methods, this new protocol could be applied to fully assess foot function in sport or clinical contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the 3 -dimensional {{kinematics}} of 'normal' walking gait in young children. A cross sectional study using nine children aged between 10 and 24 months, filmed whilst walking at natural speed, was undertaken using two gen-locked video cameras. The children were at different stages of walking development (from 0. 5 to 10 months of independent walking (IW)). Repeated measures were taken from two of the children at 10 and 17 months of age and then at 18 and 24 months respectively. 3 -dimensional video digitisation techniques utilising the DLT algorithm were used to obtain variables of the gait cycle. The position and movement of the arms were identified as potential motor development patterns. Ranges of movement and motion patterns observed in other variables are useful to determine 'normal' walking gait in such young children. The knees and hips were flexed throughout the gait cycle.

Although multiple advances in developing printing inks and pastes with novel properties are being made, the potential those can bring to electronics is hindered by their stability and performance during the printing process. In this study a UV-LED curable acrylic material was used to test the optimization of inks and pastes for three of the most common direct writing systems: Piezo-type Inkjet, Reverse Offset Roll to Plate, and Micro Deposition. The viscosity of the photosensitive acrylic matrix was controlled by either the addition of diluents or electronically functional reinforcement material. The contact angle of the optimized solutions on 16 different Polyester, Polyimide, and Paper films was observed. Solutions with larger contact angles showed better line definition for the Inkjet and the Micro Dispense systems.

40|$|We {{consider}} axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal {{magnetic field}} and an ultrarelativistic equation of state, {{with the goal of}} studying the lateral structure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the medium through which they propagate. We find all self-similar steady-state solutions of the relativistic MHD equations for this setup. One of the solutions is the case of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it propagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z) ∝ z^- 2. As the jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the ambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while the magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet. Such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle θ_j at distance z is smaller than about 1 /γ, where γ is the characteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts of the jet cannot maintain causal contact. We construct maps of optically thin synchrotron emission from our self-similar models. We suggest that the boundary pile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of M 87. We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from the jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3 C 273 and Mkn 501. Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a strong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the polarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather uncertain.
