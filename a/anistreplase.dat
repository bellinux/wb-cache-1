40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Recent {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} patients with obvious acute myocardial infarction receive thrombolysis, unless contraindicated, within 60 - 90 minutes of summoning assistance. If this target is to be achieved, {{an increasing number of}} general practitioners are likely {{to be involved in the}} administration of thrombolytic agents. AIM [...] This study aimed to assess the practicality and safety of thrombolysis with <b>anistreplase</b> when given by general practitioners. METHOD [...] An observational study was conducted in 805 general practices throughout the United Kingdom. Between March 1991 and September 1992, a total of 3383 patients with a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction were recruited [...] 888 by 344 general practitioners who wished to include <b>anistreplase</b> in their management of myocardial infarction ('user' group) and 2495 by 776 general practitioners who did not wish to use <b>anistreplase</b> but who were willing to provide information about their cases ('comparison' group). RESULTS [...] More than half the patients were seen within two hours of onset of symptoms. A high frequency of contra-indications to thrombolysis, diagnostic uncertainty, and other, mainly practical, reasons limited the number of occasions on which <b>anistreplase</b> was administered. Thus, only 310 patients were given <b>anistreplase</b> in the community. The general practitioners in the study used <b>anistreplase</b> safely. Their diagnostic accuracy was high (of the 310 patients given <b>anistreplase</b> 69 % had a definite, possible or probably myocardial infarction, 4 % a definite non-cardiac diagnosis), the number of patients given <b>anistreplase</b> in spite of a documented contraindication was small (seven patients), and the doctors appeared to be aware of potential bleeding problems associated with thrombolysis. In all cases, the complications of acute myocardial infarction appeared to be managed appropriately. CONCLUSION [...] General practitioners can use <b>anistreplase</b> both appropriately and safely in the early management of acute myocardial infarction. Recognized contraindications to thrombolysis and practicalities of diagnosis and drug administration may, however, limit the number of occasions on which <b>anistreplase</b> is used...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between coronary thrombolysis and coagulation variables after administration of <b>anistreplase</b> (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, APSAC) was studied {{in patients with}} an acute myocardial infarction. Fifty eight consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were given 30 U of <b>anistreplase</b> intravenously within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. A fall in the plasma concentration fibrinogen to less than 1. 0 g/l 90 minutes after administration of <b>anistreplase</b> was considered to reflect a systemic lytic state. Coronary angiography was performed 48 hours after thrombolytic treatment. The overall patency rate was 74 % (43 / 58). Patency rates were significantly different in patients with a systemic lytic (83 % (43 / 52)) and a systemic non-lytic state (0 % (0 / 6)). The absence of a systemic lytic state after <b>anistreplase</b> administration seemed to be highly predictive {{of the failure of}} coronary thrombolysis. Coagulation studies showed evidence of inhibition of <b>anistreplase</b> induced fibrinolytic activity which may explain the failure of thrombolytic treatment in patients with evidence of a systemic non-lytic state...|$|E
40|$|This {{randomized}} study {{compares the}} coronary perfusion rate {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with 2 different intravenous thrombolytic agents: streptokinase 1. 5 million U given over 60 minutes and anisoylated human plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (<b>anistreplase)</b> administrated as a bolus of 30 U over 5 minutes. One hundred seventy-five patients (149 men and 26 women, mean age 54 years) {{have been included in}} this study. Eighty-nine patients were treated with <b>anistreplase</b> and 86 patients with streptokinase. AMI was inferior in 54 patients (61 %) in the <b>anistreplase</b> group and in 54 patients (63 %) in the streptokinase group. It was anterior in 35 (40 %) and 32 (37 %) patients, respectively. Coronary angiography and ventriculography were performed at a mean time (+/- SEM) of 207 +/- 11 minutes after the beginning of thrombolysis in 170 patients. A perfusion score grade of 2 or 3 according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial was found in 63 patients (72 %) in the <b>anistreplase</b> group and in 56 patients (68 %) in the streptokinase group (p = NS). Severe bleeding occurred in 7 patients (8 %) after <b>anistreplase</b> and in 6 patients (7 %) after streptokinase. No cerebral hemorrhage occurred. Nine patients (5 %) died during their hospital stay: 6 after <b>anistreplase</b> and 3 after streptokinase.

40|$|Background. The {{value of}} {{thrombolytic}} therapy in unstable angina is unclear. Methods and Results. To study this problem, 159 patients were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Patients without a previous myocardial infarction, with a typical history of unstable angina, and ECG abnormalities indicative of ischemia were included. After baseline angiography, study medication (<b>anistreplase</b> or placebo) was given. Angiography was repeated after 12 - 28 hours. A significant decrease occurred in diameter stenosis {{between the first}} and second angiogram in the <b>anistreplase</b> group compared with the placebo group (11 % versus 3 %, p= 0. 008). This difference was caused by reopening of occluded vessels in the thrombolytic group. However, no beneficial clinical effects of thrombolytic treatment were found. Bleeding complications were significantly higher in patients who received thrombolytic therapy (21 versus seven patients, p= 0. 001). Conclusions. Thus, angiographic but no clinical improvement after thrombolytic treatment with <b>anistreplase</b> was found in patients with unstable angina with an excess of bleeding complications. Therefore, thrombolytic treatment cannot be recommended in patients diagnosed as having unstable angina until proven otherwise...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the time saved by administration of thrombolytic therapy at home rather than in the hospital and to assess whether earlier thrombolysis resulted in decreased mortality from acate myocardial infarction. Background. There is much theoretic, experimental and trial evidence to indicate that in acute myocardial infarction the earlier that thrombolytic therapy is given, the greater its efficacy. However, the clinical importance of this time effect is uncertain. Methods. In a randomized double-blind parallel-group clinical trial, 311 patients with suspected acute myocrdial infarction seen by their general practitioners within 4 h of symptom onset were given intravenous <b>anistreplase</b> (30 U) either at home or later, after arrival in the hospital. Results. <b>Anistreplase</b> was given at home or in the hospital at median times of 101 and 240 min, respectively, after symptom onset. The median time saved by domiciliary thrombolysis was 130 min. By the end of 1 year after trial entry, 17 (10. 4 %) of 163 patients given <b>anistreplase</b> at home died compared with 32 (21. 6 %) of 148 in those allocated <b>anistreplase</b> in the hospital (relative reduction 52 %, 95 % confidence interval 14 % to 89 %, p = 0. 007). Conclusions. In this trial the time saved by domiciliary thrombolysis by primary care physicians was > 2 h. It is likely that a similar time saving would be achieved if prehospital thrombolysis were to become established practice. Prehospital thrombolysis resulted in a halving of the mortality rate from acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|Streptokinase is well {{established}} as an effective thrombolytic. <b>Anistreplase,</b> a new thrombolytic drug, is a complex of streptokinase and acylated human plas-minogen that can be administered by intravenous bolus and activates plasmino-gen at the clot site. Although both streptokinase and <b>anistreplase</b> are effected in treating myocardial infarction (MI), they have different pharmacologic proper-ties. This {{study was designed to}} identify short- and long-term differences in their clinical effectiveness, safety in use, and survival rates in patients with acute MI. One hundred ten successive patients under seventy years of age admitted within three hours after onset of sustained chest pain suggestive of acute MI were randomized to receive either 30 units of <b>anistreplase</b> intravenously over five minutes or intravenous injection of 750, 000 units of streptokinase over thirty to sixty minutes. Reperfusion was achieved in 34 of the 52 (65 %) patients treated with anis-treplase and in 41 of the 58 (71 %) patients treated with streptokinase (p = NS). The two drugs were equally effective in preserving left ventricular ejection frac-tion, which was found to be significantly better in patients with anterior wall MI who had achieved reperfusion than it was in those who did not (p < 0. 02). One-month, twelve-month, and thirty-six-month survival rates were high (96 % to 88 %) with {{no significant difference between the}} two treatment groups. The authors conclude that the two drugs are equally effective thrombolytic agents but that <b>anistreplase</b> has the advantage that it can be administered as a bolus injection...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of community thrombolysis relative to hospital thrombolysis by investigating the extra {{costs and benefits}} of a policy of community thrombolysis, then establishing the extra cost per life saved by community thrombolysis. DESIGN: Economic evaluation {{based on the results of}} the Grampian region early <b>anistreplase</b> trial. SETTING: 29 rural general practices and one secondary care provider in Grampian, Scotland. SUBJECTS: 311 patients recruited to the Grampian region early <b>anistreplase</b> trial. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous <b>anistreplase</b> given either by general practitioners or secondary care clinicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival at 4 years and costs of administration of thrombolysis. RESULTS: Relative to hospital thrombolysis, community thrombolysis gives an additional probability of survival at 4 years of 11 % (95 % confidence interval 1 % to 22 %) at an additional cost of 425 pounds per patient. This gives a marginal cost of life saved at 4 years of 3, 890 pounds (1, 990 pounds to 42, 820 pounds).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} feasibility, safety, and {{efficacy}} of domiciliary thrombolysis by general practitioners. DESIGN [...] Randomised double blind parallel group trial of <b>anistreplase</b> 30 units intravenously and placebo given either {{at home or in}} hospital. SETTING [...] 29 rural practices in Grampian admitting patients to teaching hospitals in Aberdeen (average distance 36 (range 16 - 62) miles). PATIENTS [...] 311 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy seen at home within four hours of onset of symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Time saving, adverse events, Q wave infarction, left ventricular function. RESULTS [...] <b>Anistreplase</b> was administered at home 101 minutes after onset of symptoms, while <b>anistreplase</b> was given in hospital 240 minutes after onset of symptoms (median times). Adverse events after thrombolysis were infrequent and, apart from cardiac arrest, not a serious problem when they occurred in the community: seven of 13 patients were resuscitated after cardiac arrest out of hospital. By three months after trial entry the relative reduction of deaths from all causes in patients given thrombolytic therapy at home was 49 % (13 / 163 (8. 0 %) v 23 / 148 (15. 5 %); difference - 7. 6 % (95 % confidence interval - 14. 7 % to - 0. 4 %), p = 0. 04). Full thickness Q wave infarction was less common in patients with confirmed infarction receiving treatment at home (65 / 122 (53. 3 %) v 76 / 112 (67. 9 %); difference - 14. 6 % (95 % confidence interval - 27. 0 % to - 2. 2 %), p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS [...] General practitioners provided rapid pre-hospital coronary care of a high standard. Compared with later administration in hospital, giving <b>anistreplase</b> at home resulted in reduction in mortality, fewer cardiac arrests, fewer Q wave infarcts, and better left ventricular function.

40|$|AIMS: To compare plasma {{myoglobin}} {{concentration and}} cardiac enzyme activity with electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in {{two groups of}} patients (reperfused and non-reperfused) participating in a placebo-controlled randomised double blind trial of treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) with intravenous thrombolytic therapy (<b>Anistreplase).</b> METHODS: Twenty two patients with confirmed MI obeying strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were studied. Plasma myoglobin was measured by radioimmunoassay and creatine kinase enzyme (CK and CKMB) by NAC activated and NAC activated/immunoinhibition methods respectively in all patients before and at frequent intervals after injection of <b>Anistreplase</b> or placebo. Patients were divided into reperfused (R) and non-reperfused (NR) groups {{on the basis of}} ECG criteria. Reperfusion was diagnosed if the measured ST segment elevation fell by {{greater than or equal to}} 50 % at 2 hours post dosing. RESULTS: The time to peak (TTP) myoglobin was significantly less in the R group compared with the NR group but there was considerable overlap in the range of values. The area under the enzyme time curves (AUCs) and summed ST segment epsilon ST elevations were significantly smaller in the R compared with the NR group. CONCLUSIONS: Although TTP myoglobin results were significantly lower in the R group, TTP myoglobin will probably not be useful as an non-invasive indicator of reperfusion because of the overlap in values between the two groups. The significant reduction in the AUC and epsilon ST only in the R group suggests decreased infarct size.

40|$|In {{patients}} with {{acute myocardial infarction}} (MI), quick initiation of thrombolytic therapy is the best strategy for improvement of survival and reduction of morbidity. Streptokinase, a purified product of haemolytic streptococci, is the most commonly administered agent. The compound <b>anistreplase</b> (a complex of streptokinase to plasminogen), is available but currently not often used. The nonantigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA). Due to former use of streptokinase or its derivative <b>anistreplase,</b> patients may develop specific antibodies to the foreign protein, whereas cross-reacting antibodies {{may be due to}} streptococcal infections. These antibodies may neutralise streptokinase or its derivative in case of (re) administration and may mediate adverse events, sometimes serious. Since advanced age by itself is certainly not a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy, and because reinfarction occurs frequently, the benefit-risk ratio of re-exposure to streptokinase or its derivative is decreased in the elderly who present with reinfarction. In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether failure of thrombolytic treatment might be due to inhibition of fibrinolysis by high lipoprotein(a) levels. Fifty-eight patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated intravenously within 4 h after onset of symptoms with <b>anistreplase</b> (30 units) and heparin (30 000 IU/ 24 h). Blood samples for measurement of coagulation parameters were taken before and 1. 5 h after treatment. Coronary angiography was performed after 48 h. Levels of lipoprotein(a) were measured 6 months after discharge from hospital. The patency rate was 74 % (43 / 58). Median lipoprotein(a) levels were not different between the patients with a patent and those with a non-patent vessel (10 and 8 mg/dl, respectively), however, in patients with a non-patent infarct-related vessel, a significant inverse correlation was found between the lipoprotein(a) level and the decrease of plasminogen in the first 1. 5 h after treatment. It is concluded that high lipoprotein(a) levels, although not directly associated with a poor outcome of <b>anistreplase</b> therapy, might contribute to insufficient fibrinolysis in patients with a non-patent infarct-related vessel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{thrombolytic}} {{and systemic}} effects of BM 06. 022 were evaluated and {{compared with those}} of alteplase, <b>anistreplase,</b> streptokinase and urokinase in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. BM 06. 022 consists of the kringle- 2 and protease domains of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and is unglycosytated because of its expression in Eicherichia colicells. Thrombus formation in anesthetized open chest dogs was induced by electrical injury to the intimal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery at a high level site of obstruction. In heparinized dogs, none of six vehicle-treated animals exhibited reperfusion. Reperfusion was achieved in four of six dogs at 18. 3 Â± 6 min after intravenous bolus injection of 140 kU/kg (0. 24 mg/kg) of BM 06. 022, whereas four of six dogs exhibited reperfusion later (p < 0. 05) at 76. 5 Â± 16. 1 min during infusion of 1. 33 mg/kg of alteplase (0. 13 mg/kg as initial bolus injection, followed by 0. 66 mg/kg over 1 h and 0. 53 mg/kg over 2 h). Significantly later (p < 0. 05) reperfusion than that achieved with BM 06. 022 was achieved in five of six dogs at 57. 8 Â± 12. 1 min after intravenous injection of 0. 4 U/kg of <b>anistreplase.</b> Streptokinase (21, 000 IU/kg over 60 min) and urokinase (20, 000 IU/kg as an intravenous bolus injection, followed by 20, 000 IU/kg over 89 min) each induced reperfusion in three of six dogs but at 67 Â± 12 and 84. 3 Â± 17. 1 min (p < 0. 05 vs. BM 06. 022), respectively. Residual fibrinogen was lower (p < 0. 05) in the <b>anistreplase</b> (4. 3 Â± 0. 2 %) and urokinase (26. 2 Â± 11. 5 %) groups compared with the BM 06. 022 group (95. 7 Â± 3. 7 %) but was similar in the alteplase (97. 2 Â± 3. 3 %) and streptokinase (101. 1 Â± 3. 5 %) groups. Bleeding time at 90 min was similar in the alteplase (3. 8 Â± 0. 9 min) and BM 06. 022 (2. 5 Â± 0. 2 min) groups but was longer (p < 0. 05) in the <b>anistreplase</b> (13. 5 Â± 4. 3 min), streptokinase (9. 5 Â± 2. 5 min) and urokinase (6. 3 Â± 2 min) groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} pretreatment streptokinase resistance titre and the concentration of IgG antibodies to streptokinase on the efficacy of thrombolytic drugs containing streptokinase in restoring coronary patency in acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN [...] Comparative observational study. SETTING [...] City general hospital. PATIENTS [...] One hundred and twenty four previously unexposed patients presenting within six hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS [...] Streptokinase, 1. 5 MIU as intravenous infusion over 60 minutes (60 patients), or <b>anistreplase,</b> 30 units as intravenous injection over five minutes (64 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Pretreatment streptokinase resistance titre and concentration of IgG antibodies to streptokinase were measured in 96 and 124 patients respectively and coronary patency assessed angiographically at 90 minutes and 24 hours. RESULTS [...] Pretreatment streptokinase resistance titre and concentrations of IgG antibodies to streptokinase were low and skewed towards higher values. Those patients with coronary occlusion at 24 hours had a significantly higher median streptokinase resistance titre (100 v 50 streptokinase IU ml- 1, P = 0. 02). There were trends towards a higher streptokinase resistance titre in those patients with coronary occlusion at 90 minutes (50 v 20 streptokinase IU ml- 1, P = 0. 06) and higher concentrations of IgG antibodies to streptokinase in those with coronary occlusion at both 90 minutes and 24 hours (1. 53 v 0. 925, P = 0. 03; 1. 65 v 1. 04 micrograms streptokinase binding ml- 1, P = 0. 06). Coronary patency rates were similar in the two treatment groups.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{we report on the}} development, introduction, and {{maintenance}} of a policy to promote rational use of thrombolytic drugs by hospital doctors. The work was undertaken {{within the framework of the}} voluntarily operated Riverside East drugs guide (formulary) management system (FMS). The policy was introduced in October 1988 and revised in November 1989 to coincide with the launch of the new, expensive thrombolytic drugs, alteplase (rt-PA, Actilyse) in 1988 and antistreplase (APSAC, Eminase) in 1989. Streptokinase was recommended as the first-line drug for patients who had not received it within the last 6 months. The policy was communicated to all staff in meetings and a drugs guide bulletin and reinforced by ward pharmacists. Results over a 15 month period show voluntary compliance by prescribers with the recommended policy. One hundred and seventy-four patients (22 % cardiac admissions) presented with acute myocardial infarction. Of these 43 (25 %) received streptokinase, the first-line recommended drug, 7 received alteplase and none received <b>anistreplase.</b> The savings in drug expenditure from using streptokinase rather than alteplase or <b>anistreplase</b> for the 15 -month period of investigation were over pounds 27, 000.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare aspirin with anticoagulation {{with regard}} to risk of cardiac death and reinfarction in {{patients}} who received <b>anistreplase</b> thrombolysis for myocardial infarction. DESIGN: A multicentre unblinded randomised clinical trial. SETTING: 38 hospitals in six countries. SUBJECTS: 1036 patients who had been treated with <b>anistreplase</b> for myocardial infarction {{were randomly assigned to}} either aspirin (150 mg daily) or anticoagulation (intravenous heparin followed by warfarin or other oral anticoagulant). The trial was stopped earlier than originally intended because of the slowing rate of recruitment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cardiac death or recurrent myocardial infarction at 30 days. RESULTS: After 30 days cardiac death or reinfarction, occurred in 11. 0 % (57 / 517) of the patients treated with anticoagulation and 11. 2 % (58 / 519) of the patients treated with aspirin (odds ratio 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval 0. 69 to 1. 50, P = 0. 92). Corresponding findings at three months were 13. 2 % (68 / 517) and 12. 1 % (63 / 519) (0. 91, 0. 63 to 1. 32, P = 0. 67). Patients receiving anticoagulation were more likely than patients receiving aspirin to have had severe bleeding or a stroke by three months (3. 9 % v 1. 7 % (0. 44, 0. 20 to 0. 97, P = 0. 04)). CONCLUSION: No evidence of a difference in the incidence of cardiac events was found between the two treatment groups, though the trial is too small to claim treatment equivalence confidently. A higher incidence of severe bleeding events and strokes was detected in the group receiving anticoagulation, suggesting that aspirin may be the drug of choice for most patients in this context...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This report {{presents}} the 5 -year {{results of the}} Grampian Region Early <b>Anistreplase</b> Trial (GREAT) and quantifies the benefit of earlier thrombolysis in terms that are generally applicable. Background. Although it is accepted that the earlier thrombolytic therapy is given for acute myocardial infarction the greater the benefit, there are widely differing estimates {{of the magnitude of}} the time-related benefit of thrombolysis because of inappropriate trial design and analysis. Methods. In a previously reported randomized trial, <b>anistreplase</b> (30 U) was given intravenously either before hospital admission or in the hospital, at a median time of 105 and 240 min, respectively, after onset of symptoms. Intention to treat and multivariate analyses of the 5 -year results were performed. Results. By 5 years, 41 (25 %) of 163 patients had died in the prehospital treatment group compared with 53 (36 %) of 148 in the hospital treatment group (log-rank test, p < 0. 025). Delaying thrombolytic treatment by 1 h increases the hazard ratio of death by 20 %, equivalent to the loss of 43 / 1, 000 lives within the next 5 years (95 % confidence interval 7 to 88, p = 0. 012). Delaying thrombolytic treatment by 30 min reduces the average expectation of life by âˆ¼ 1 year. Conclusions. The magnitude of the benefit from earlier thrombolysis is such that giving thrombolytic therapy to patients with acute myocardial infarction should be accorded the same degree of urgency as treatment of cardiac arrest. Policies should be developed for giving thrombolytic therapy on-site if practicable and by the first qualified person to see the patient...|$|E

By 12 months mortality (5. 8 % (23 patients) in the intervention group v 5. 0 % (20) in the conservative care group; p = 0. 6) and rates of reinfarction (15. 1 % (60 patients) v 12. 9 % (52); p = 0. 4) were similar in the two groups. No significant differences in rates of angina or rest pain were found at 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction at three and 12 months was the same in both groups. Median hospital stay was longer in the intervention group (11 days v 10 days; p less than 0. 0001). CONCLUSION [...] For most patients given thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction a strategy of angiography and intervention is appropriate only when required for clinical indications...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} the earliest electrocardiographic changes in patients with suspected myocardial infarction and their sensitivity and specificity for predicting the final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of paired electrocardiograms recorded at home and on admission to hospital. SETTING [...] 29 rural practices in Grampian and teaching hospitals in Aberdeen. PATIENTS [...] 137 patients participating in the early <b>anistreplase</b> trial in the Grampian region, who received placebo at home and for whom paired electrocardiograms were available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Classified electrocardiographic abnormalities and diagnosis at discharge. RESULTS [...] Electrocardiograms were recorded immediately before injection of placebo at home and <b>anistreplase</b> in hospital at median times of 110 and 240 minutes after the onset of symptoms. Definite or probable myocardial infarction was later confirmed in 93 (68 %) patients. Of these, 66 (71 %) had the same findings on both electrocardiograms of either ST elevation, bundle branch block, or a non-specific abnormality, while 27 (29 %) showed a major change of classification between home and hospital recordings; 21 (23 %) had ST elevation or bundle branch block on {{only one of the}} paired recordings. Although ST elevation was the commonest abnormality in the 93 patients with myocardial infarction, in only 51 was it recorded at home (sensitivity 55 %) and in 49 on admission (sensitivity 53 %). Of 57 patients with ST elevation at home, six did not have infarction (specificity 86 %), while of 51 with ST elevation on admission, two did not have infarction (specificity 95 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] Elevation of the ST segment is a transient electrocardiographic abnormality that has high specificity but low sensitivity for predicting the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction; it is an unsatisfactory precondition for giving thrombolytic treatment to patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that the earlier a patient reaches hospital and receives thrombolysis, the better the outcome. The GREAT (Grampian Region Early <b>Anistreplase</b> Trial) directly addressed the issue of early thrombolysis by evaluating, in a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of thrombolysis in the community compared with that administered in hospital. Objective: This paper aimed to model the cost and benefits of community compared with hospital thrombolysis from the UK NHS perspective, using efficacy data from the GREAT. Methods: A decision-analytic approach was used to model these two alternatives. Resource use and cost estimates were estimated for a single tertiary centre. Estimates of effectiveness in life-years were obtained from the 4 -year follow-up for patients recruited to the GREAT, using declining exponential approximation of life expectancy. Costs are in Lstg, 2000 / 1 values. Results: Community thrombolysis had an average life expectancy of 12. 48 years and hospital thrombolysis had an average life expectancy of 12. 39 years. Costs were Lstg 361 for community thrombolysis and Lstg 300 for hospital thrombolysis. Community thrombolysis led to an additional 0. 09 years of life-expectancy gained compared with hospital thrombolysis at an additional cost of Lstg 61 per patient. Therefore, the incremental cost per life-year gained for the community thrombolysis service over the hospital thrombolysis service was Lstg 667. Sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of cost per life-year gained were most sensitive to the estimates of survival. Conclusion: This model suggests that, from the UK NHS perspective, implementing community thrombolysis may lead to extra survival but at extra cost over hospital thrombolysis. Although the incremental cost per life-year is modest, judgements still have to be made, however, as to whether the extra benefits estimated are worth the additional resources required. This requires consideration of the local context in which the service may be introduced. <b>Anistreplase,</b> Cost-effectiveness, Heparin, Myocardial-infarction, Streptokinase, Thrombolytics...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This double-blind, randomized, multicenler {{trial was}} {{designed}} to compare the effects of treatment with <b>anistreplase</b> (APSAC) and alteplase (rt-PA) on convalescent left ventricular function, morbidity and coronary artery patency at 1 day in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Background. <b>Anistreplase</b> (APSAC) is a new, easily administered thrombolytk agent recently approved for treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Alteplase (rt-PA) is a rapidly acting, relatively fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent that is currently {{the most widely used}} agent in the United States. Methods. Study entry requirements were age â‰¤ 75 years, symptom duration â‰¤ 4 h, ST segment elevation and no contraindications. The two study drugs, APSAC, 30 U/ 2 to S min, and rt-PA, 100 mg/ 3 h, were each given with aspirin (160 mg/day) and intravenous heparin. Prespecified end points were convalescent left ventrkular function (rest/exercise), clinical morbidity and coronary artery patency at 1 day. A total of 325 patients were entered, stratified into groups with anterior (37 %) or inferior or other (63 %) acute myocardial infarction, randomized to receive APSAC or rt-PA and followed up for 1 month. Results. At entry, patient characteristics in the two groups were balanced. Convalescent ejection fraction at the predischarge study averaged 51. 3 % in the APSAC group and 54. 2 % in the rt-PA group (p < 0. 05); at 1 month, ejection fraction averaged 50. 2 % versus 54. 8 %, respectively (p < 0. 61). In contrast, ejection fraction showed similar augmentation with exercise at 1 month after APSAC (+ 4. 3 % points) and rt-PA (+ 4. 6 % points), and exercise times were comparable. Coronary artery patency at 1 day was high and similar in berth groups (APSAC 89 %, rt-PA 86 %). Mortality (APSAC 6. 2 %, rt-PA 7. 9 %) and the incidence of other serious clinical events, including stroke, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, heart failure within 1 month, recurrent ischemia and reinfarelion were comparable in the two groups; and mechanical interventions were applied with equal frequency. A combined clinical morbidity index was determined and showed a comparable overall outcome for the two treatments. Conclusions. Convalescent rest ejection fraction was high after both therapies but higher after rt-PA; other clinical outcomes, including exercise function, morbidity index, and 1 -day coronary artery patency, were favorable and comparable after APSAC and rt-PA...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES [...] (1) To {{measure the}} quality of life and the loss of quality {{adjusted}} days (QADS) after suspected acute myocardial infarction in patients who received thrombolytic treatment either at home or in hospital. (2) To compare the loss of QADS as a trial endpoint with the conventional endpoints of mortality and Q-wave infarction. DESIGN [...] Randomised double blind parallel group trial of <b>anistreplase</b> (30 U given intravenously) and placebo given either at home or in hospital. SETTING [...] Rural practices in Grampian admitting patients to teaching hospitals in Aberdeen. PATIENTS [...] A total of 311 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and no contraindications to thrombolytic treatment seen at home within four hours of the onset of symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Loss of quality adjusted days (QADS) in the first 100 days after suspected myocardial infarction (365 QADS = 1 QALY) was the main outcome measure. Compared with later administration in hospital, <b>anistreplase</b> at home resulted in a relative reduction of mortality of 49 % (95 % confidence interval 3. 95 %, 2 p = 0. 04), and a relative reduction of 26 % in the proportion of survivors with infarction who had Q-waves (95 % CI 7. 44 %, 2 p = 0. 007). During the 100 day follow up, the median loss of QADS was 25 for all patients. This loss was significantly greater in those who died than in survivors (65 v 18, 2 p < 0. 001), and in survivors with infarction than in survivors without infarction (26 v 13, 2 p < 0. 01). However, {{there was no significant difference}} in loss of QADS in those with infarction with or without Q-waves (29 v 21, NS), and the median loss of QADS was not significantly different in those who had thrombolytic treatment at home or in hospital (median difference 0, 95 % CI - 5, + 4 QADS). CONCLUSIONS [...] Loss of QADS had two serious limitations as an outcome measure: it was less sensitive than mortality and it failed to reflect physiological benefit. Palliative treatment with no physiological effect would have resulted in a greater gain in QADS (or QALYs) than did early thrombolytic treatment. Extreme caution is required in accepting a gain in QALYs as a valid outcome measure for health care...|$|E
40|$|Background. Coronary patency {{has been}} used as a measure of {{thrombolysis}} success after acute myocardial infarction. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group perfusion grades have gained wide acceptance, with grades 0 (no distal flow) and 1 perfusion (minimal flow) being designated as thrombolysis failures and grades 2 (partial perfusion) and 3 (complete perfusion) as thrombolysis successes. However, the significance of the individual TIMI grades on clinical outcome has not been adequately assessed. Methods and Results. To evaluate the functional significance of TIMI perfusion grades, we compared 1 -day coronary patency status with ventriculographic, enzymatic, and ECG indexes of acute myocardial infarction in 298 patients treated with <b>anistreplase</b> or alteplase within 4 hours of myocardial infarction symptom onset. Radionuclide ejection fraction was determined at 1 week and at 1 month. Perfusion grades for the entire study population were distributed as 12 % (n= 37) grades 0 / 1, 13 % (n= 40) grade 2, and 74 % (n= 221) grade 3. Patency profile did not differ between the two thrombolytic regimens. Further coronary interventions were performed after the 1 -day patency determination in 43 % of patients (43 %, 48 %, 42 %, respectively, in grades 0 / 1, 2, and 3 patients). The outcome of grade 2 patients did not differ from grades 0 / 1 patients in ejection fraction, enzyme peaks, ECG markers, or morbidity index. In contrast, grade...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{prospective}} {{study investigated the}} behavior of thrombin generation and activity during thrombolysis and concomitant heparin administration. Background. It {{has been shown that}} during thrombolytic therapy there is an increase in thrombin generation and activity. Increased thrombin activity is suppressed by concomitant intravenous heparin, but it is unknown whether thrombin generation is also affected. Methods. Thrombin generation was assessed by measuring prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and thrombinâ€”antithrombin complex plasma levels and thrombin activity by measuring fibrinopeptide A plasma levels. Serial blood samples were obtained before and at 90 min and 24 and 48 h after the administration of streptokinase (15 patients), recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (15 patients) or <b>anistreplase</b> (13 patients). An intravenous bolus of heparin (5, 000 IU) was administered before the start of thrombolytic therapy, followed by an infusion of 1, 000 U/h to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time > 1. 5 times baseline. Results. During thrombolytic and concomitant heparin therapy, there was an increase in the plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (baseline 1. 08 vs. 2. 73 nmol/liter, p < 0. 001) and thrombinâ€”antithrombin complex (baseline 6. 5 vs. 17. 1 Î¼g/ml, p < 0. 01) at 90 min, whereas no change was observed in fibrinopeptide A at 90 min (baseline 2. 8 vs. 3. 0 nmol/liter, p = NS).

During thrombolytic therapy with both fibrinspecific and nonâ€”fibrin-specific drugs, there is an increase in thrombin generation despite concomitant administration of intravenous heparin...|$|E
40|$|SUmmARY There is a {{need for}} a simple {{clinical}} measurement that will indicate the extent of myocardial salvage after successful thrombolysis. This study examined whether coronary artery reperfusion reduced the infarct size as assessed electrocardiographically after thrombolytic treatment. The sum of the (E) ST segment area in leads showing ST segment elevation in the 12 lead electrocardiogram at presentation was used as an index of potential myocardial injury (initial ischaemic index). The evolved infarct size at 48 h was assessed by a QRS scoring system. Two groups of patients, both admitted with anterior myocardial infarction within 6 h of onset, were studied. Group 1 (n = 35) received analgesia only and group 2 (n = 33) received thrombolytic treatment either by the intracoronary (streptokinase, n = 13) or intravenous route (<b>anistreplase,</b> n = 20). Reperfusion was assessed angiographically. The mean (SD potential infarct size assessed by the initial ischaemic index was similar in both groups (group 1, ST area = 115 (60) MM 2 and group 2 = 126 (77 mm 2). The QRS score representing evolved infarct size was significantly lower in the treated group (4 - 1 (2 - 5)) than in group 1 (7 - 8 (2 - 6)). The 95 % confidence intervals for QRS scores based on the admission E ST area from patients with successful reperfusion were applied to a third set of patients (n = 22) to test the ability of the admission ST area (myocardial injury) t...|$|E
