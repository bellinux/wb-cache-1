The main feature were usage of various props such as a prison for Stefani's opening act, a six-piece band and a large multimedia screen in the backdrop showing videos and animations.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period.

In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E

5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that he {{had lost}} the initiative, was low on {{ammunition}} and food, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly , but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark. The battle was over.|$|E
5|$|The first Matsalu Nature Film Festival {{was held}} between October 3 and October 5, 2003, in Lihula with a {{competitive}} program of 23 films from 7 countries. More than 2,500 people visited the festival that year. The second festival was held between September 23, and September 25, 2004, with participants from 14 countries, a competitive program of 35 films and around 5,000 visitors. The third festival {{took place between}} September 22 and September 25, 2005, with a competitive program of 39 films from 16 countries and over 7,000 visitors. The fourth festival, held between September 21 and September 24 in 2006, had 21 participating countries and 41 competing films. The fifth Matsalu Nature Film Festival was held between September 19 and September 23, 2007, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> than 7,000 visitors. Organizers admit that as the festival is held on a nature reserve, it cannot grow much larger in a little town and therefore plan to bring mostly European nature documentaries to the festival, {{at the same time}} not forgetting the human-related topics.|$|E

5|$|The rank of {{midshipman}} originated {{during the}} Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally {{referred to a}} post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published {{use of the term}} midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{candidates}} were Mary Davis, Seán Gallagher, Michael D. Higgins, Martin McGuinness, Gay Mitchell, David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon. Davis, Gallagher, Norris and Scallon (all running as Independents), secured their nominations via local authorities. Higgins was {{put forward by}} Labour, McGuinness was put forward by Sinn Féin and Mitchell was put forward by Fine Gael. The previously dominant Fianna Fáil party declined to put forward an official candidate following their disastrous general election campaign earlier that year. Norris, a civil rights campaigner credited with helping overthrow Ireland's laws criminalising homosexuality, was the leading candidate {{for much of the}} race, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> than double the support of the other declared candidates in January 2011. He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in March 1897, she was {{relieved}} of that duty and became a depot ship in July at Devonport. The ship was reboilered <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> QF guns installed in 1898. Dreadnought was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900 and took part in British fleet manoeuvres in that year and the following one. In June 1902, she was refitted at Chatham {{to serve as a}} tender to HMS Defiance, torpedo school ship at Devonport, and later as a depot ship. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and was commissioned as tender four days later, on 20 August 1902. She was taken out of service and transferred to the Kyles of Bute in 1905. The ship was sold to Thos W Ward's for scrap for £23,000 on 14 July 1908 and was broken up by February 1909.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} {{to begin the}} game, and Air Force began the first drive of the game at its 20-yard line after a touchback. The Falcons began the game with three {{consecutive}} short rushes that failed to gain a first down and punted the ball away to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their first drive of the game after a short return to their 35-yard line. As had Air Force before them, Tech was unable to gain a first down and punted. Air Force began its second drive at its 34-yard line <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> success on its second drive. Aided by an offside penalty against Virginia Tech, the Falcons picked up a first down with a big run by Bart Weiss that penetrated the Tech side of the field. That run was followed by several others from the Falcons, who drove inside the Tech red zone before being stopped by the Tech defense. Facing fourth down, Air Force attempted a 35-yard field goal, which was successful. With 6:35 remaining in the first quarter, Air Force took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance {{set about}} {{preparing}} for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke {{caught up with the}} French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping past him and attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> ammunition than the confederates. They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition. The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but fortunately for the confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E
5|$|Ride the Lightning is {{the second}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory {{to the rest of}} the band <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine.|$|E
5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E
