40|$|In November of 2014, {{hundreds}} of <b>advanced</b> <b>tax</b> <b>agreement</b> (ATAs) issued by Luxembourg’s Administration des Contributions Directes (Luxembourg’s Inland Revenue, or LACD) to multinational corporate taxpayers (MNCs) were made public. Using an original dataset generated from a hand-coded sample of 172 leaked documents, the Article explores LACD administrative practices in issuing ATAs. The analysis demonstrates how a jurisdiction {{can be made}} a tax-haven by administrative practices, rather than by state law. LACD cannot be reasonably viewed – as some have suggested in LACD’s defense – a passive player in MNCs’ tax avoidance schemes. Rather, LACD is best described as a manufacturer of tax arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, even when the tax laws of the jurisdictions of residence (i. e., investors) and source (i. e., investment) are harmonized, LACD produced regulatory instruments that were intended to artificially create legal differences between the tax laws of the source and residence jurisdictions. MNCs could then exploit the manufactured tax differences to their advantage. LACD collected a fee that was functionally linked {{to the amount of}} taxes avoided by MNCs in the other jurisdictions. The findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} role of tax havens in global economy, by adding an institutional dimension to the phenomena of international tax arbitrage. Specifically, tax administrators can function as intermediaries between residence and source jurisdictions the laws of which are harmonized, and provide taxpayers with synthetic arbitrage opportunities. Hence, international coordination efforts to combat abusive tax schemes by way of <b>advancing</b> harmonization of <b>tax</b> laws may not be as effective as hoped. The Article concludes that international efforts should systematically address arbitrage manufacturing. Namely, the targets of coordinated attempts to combat international tax arbitrage should be tax administrations, and not only taxpayers...|$|R

The present paper applies prospect theory to a simple model of tax evasion, exploring the role that <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> payments may play in enforcing tax laws. The paper demonstrates, as empirically found in the United States, that <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> payments may substitute for costly detection efforts in enhancing compliance.

As a result, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had to identify eligible taxpayers so that checks could be sent to these taxpayers by December 31, 2001. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service was to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, with the first checks to be received {{during the week of}} July 23, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, 84 million taxpayers were to have received $ 36 billion in <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> funds. IRS offset about $ 2. 1 billion from these <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> refunds to recover delinquent federal taxes. IRS spent $ 104 million to run the program through September 2001, which included IRS staffing costs as well as the costs associated with contracts, postage, and printing. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified two initial problems that affected either the accuracy or timeliness of the advance refund notices. One involved computer programming errors that resulted in 523, 000 taxpayers receiving notices indicating that they would receive larger <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> refunds than they were entitled to receive. The IG also determined that 5. 3 million taxpayers who had filled their tax returns by the April 16 filing deadline would have delays of up to nine weeks in receiving their advance refund notices. Two problems that continued throughout the <b>advance</b> <b>tax</b> refund period involved (1) undeliverable refund notices and checks due to incorrect addresses and (2) taxpayer difficulties in reaching IRS telephone assistors.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{different}} tax systems adopted by countries, foreign-sourced income earned by taxpayers may be subject to double taxation. This may therefore impede cross-border trade and investment. Double taxation relief is provided unilaterally, in terms of a country’s domestic laws or bilaterally in terms of Double Taxation Agreements. South African residents earning income from the Democratic Republic of Congo may be subject to tax in both countries. To eliminate such double taxation the South African Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962, provides for unilateral relief from double taxation in the form of exemptions, rebates and deductions. The double <b>tax</b> <b>agreement</b> between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo came into effect recently and double taxation relief for South African residents is now also available in terms of tax treaty law.
