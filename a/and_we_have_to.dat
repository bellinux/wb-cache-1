While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains.

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, {{by virtue of their}} Premier League status. Their opening match was a 3–1 win against Second Division Blackpool, where Grimandi, Adams and Overmars got themselves on the scoresheet. In the fourth round, Arsenal faced Leicester City at Highbury. The match ended goalless, meaning a replay was staged at Filbert Street. With neither side able to score in the 90 minutes and extra time, the game was settled on penalties. Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad blocked Dixon and Grimandi's spot-kicks to help his side win. Wenger said he was [...] "upset" [...] with the loss, adding [...] "the most important thing is the championship <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths.

We can't hurt the whalers <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E

500|$|The Hergé Foundation has {{maintained}} {{control of the}} licenses, through Moulinsart, the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: [...] "We {{have to be very}} protective of the property. We don't take lightly any potential partners <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be very selective... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use." [...] However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as [...] "trivialising the work of Hergé by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising" [...] {{in the wake of a}} move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.|$|E
500|$|In the VH1 special Madonna Speaks, {{the artist}} further {{clarified}} that the theme behind [...] "Hollywood", {{as well as}} [...] "American Life" [...] And [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from the album, was about her [...] "wanting to shout from the rooftops that we have all {{been living in a}} dream. I have been living in a dream — and you're all living in a dream <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wake up to reality." [...] Madonna's first single from American Life—the title track—became the lowest charting first single from a Madonna album since her debut, reaching a peak of number37 on the Billboard Hot 100. Warner Bros. Records hastily wanted to save the album from dropping off the charts, and decided to release [...] "Hollywood", believing the song to have commercial success potential.|$|E
500|$|The first {{preliminary}} results were {{announced by the}} State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced {{that there was a}} tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said [...] "It's not what we expected, it's different to our projections, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept it." [...] However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed [...] "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. [...] The results on the absolute bail bill means that [...] "Puerto Rico remains {{the only place in the}} Western Hemisphere where everyone is entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|R
500|$|Two {{more points}} were dropped in Arsenal's next match, away to Leicester City {{on the first}} weekend of December. Henry was absent from the {{starting}} team as was captain Vieira. Arsenal had taken the lead at the hour mark through a Gilberto header, but conceded the equaliser in stoppage time. What made matters worse was the dismissal of Cole for a two-footed lunge on Ben Thatcher; he missed the team's next three fixtures as a result. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "It looked like Ashley {{wanted to get the}} ball but it was a two-footed tackle that was too high, it was a red card <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept it." [...] A goal from Bergkamp earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, at home to Blackburn Rovers. Chelsea's defeat a day before meant the win for Arsenal was enough to take them back top, a point clear of Manchester United, who were now in second place.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, McGuinness {{said that}} the album was almost {{complete}} and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent {{was no longer the}} likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel your freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E

500|$|Film author Patrick Webster {{considers}} Kubrick's {{methods of}} writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness {{to allow him to}} improvise a scene, stating that [...] "there was a script <b>and</b> <b>we</b> followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it".|$|R
500|$|I {{was very}} pleased it was made at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going <b>to</b> do this', <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the {{schedule}} we want, so we're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|R
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do something about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter joined Conference National side Lincoln City on a free {{transfer}} in July 2011. Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Weta Digital {{took over}} duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We shared assets {{back and forth}} with ILM, but our {{pipelines}} are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different."

30|$|So, to {{come back}} to our {{original}} question, something that has a property opposite to fragile should not only remain unharmed (and unchanged) by the perturbations and by the passage of time; rather it should sometimes also improve and benefit from the disorder. If such a thing existed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ship it by postal service, we would write on the parcel “Antifragile. Mishandle carelessly”, because such things or systems would be able to benefit from events, perturbations, volatility, disorder—that is to say, from time.|$|R
