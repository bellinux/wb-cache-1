500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Sinatra {{released}} Close to You, A Swingin' Affair! <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> You?—his {{first album}} in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers [...] "Close to You" [...] {{to have been}} thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the [...] "golden" [...] era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was [...] "extremely progressive" [...] by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs [...] "With Every Breath I Take", [...] "Blame It On My Youth" [...] and [...] "It Could Happen to You". For Granata, Sinatra's A Swingin' Affair! and swing music predecessor Songs for Swingin' Lovers! solidified [...] "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and noted that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as the Sinatra '57 in Concert live album, after Sinatra's death. In 1958 Sinatra released the album Come Fly with Me with Billy May. It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, [...] "Come Fly With Me", written especially for him, {{would become one of}} his best known standards. On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth was planned, [...] "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.1. Cuts from this LP, such as [...] "Angel Eyes" [...] and [...] "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of the [...] "saloon song" [...] segments of Sinatra's concerts.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Piechociński {{suggested}} that Poland should join the Eurozone in 2020 at the earliest.

2500|$|The duo and {{the rest}} of the show's writing staff then spent three weeks writing {{material}} for the episode, with it being twice the length of a standard episode. The writers did not intentionally tone down their material as they knew that Lucasfilm would inform them of any items unsuitable for broadcast. Lucasfilm's director of marketing Tom Warner noted that [...] "There were definitely a few [...] I batted an eye at, and if I were producing probably wouldn't have put in. But they were having fun with it." [...] The writers decided not to choose [...] "obvious" [...] things to subvert so, for example, rather than just penning a sketch mocking Jar Jar Binks, had Jar Jar meet up with Darth Vader and react to the changes he has undergone since they last met. Goldstein noted [...] "It was a wild challenge to come up with fresh, new stuff since Star Wars has already been parodied for 30 years now." [...] On the style of the humor, Green opined: [...] "We love to emphasize the mundane in the extraordinary, and Star Wars was perfect for that. You have something that's intergalactic, and yet there's got to be some textural machinations of day-to-day business: How can you run an industry that large without paperwork? <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> the bathrooms?" ...|$|E
