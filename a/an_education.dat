Using a logistic regression methodology, this study explored (a) the relationship between identification with <b>a</b> special <b>education</b> communication disorder by race/ethnicity, (b) the relationship between identification with <b>a</b> special <b>education</b> communication disorder by native language, (c) the relationship between identification with <b>a</b> special <b>education</b> communication disorder by socioeconomic status (based on free and reduced lunch status), and (d) the relationship between identification with <b>a</b> special <b>education</b> communication disorder by EL status.
