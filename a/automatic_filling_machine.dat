40|$|The {{development}} of mechatronic systems {{involves the use}} of multiple disciplines, from mechanical engineering to electronics engineering and computer science. Traditionally, every discipline was developed independently and then integrated to generate the final system. However, high-quality designs cannot be achieved without simultaneously considering all the engineering disciplines. This integrated approach carries an intrinsic complexity into system design process and numerous researches are on-going in order to find out optimal methods. This article illustrates a methodology based on Model-Based System Engineering to support the integrated {{development of}} complex mechatronic devices. The main contribution is the introduction of a design methodology based on the W model and the identification of SysML as the tool to support the whole process. This method will also address the problem of “devices interchangeability”, that means the possibility to develop the functionality of a system with different operation principles, at a very early stage of the development process (i. e. during the conceptual development). To achieve this goal, the methodology treats the problem of linking the conceptual with executable models to enable the validation by simulation. Main advantages of this methodology are in providing, to the mechatronic systems designers, a fixed schedule which does not limit their intuition and reduces complexity through a hierarchical approach. The process has been tested through the rationalization of the choices that have brought to the current solution of the filling system of an <b>automatic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> for liquid foodstuff...|$|E

40|$|Critical {{contamination}} {{sites and}} {{sources for the}} Gram-negative psychrotrophs (GNP) of the taxa Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas, and the Gram-positive spore-forming (GPS) species Bacillus cereus, have been traced in the production line of pasteurised milk. Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> and in air surrounding the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> over long periods, especially at the bottom of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant. By using traditional microbiological methods and RAPD-typing, the pasteurised milk was once found to be contaminated by B. cereus while passing through one pasteuriser, and commonly found to be contaminated during the filling procedure...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> and the packaged ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.
