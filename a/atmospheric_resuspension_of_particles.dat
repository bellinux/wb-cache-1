40|$|Airborne <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> {{biological}} origin – bioaerosols – {{are present}} everywhere, including the indoor environment where people spend considerable amounts of time, {{and exposure to}} such materials via inhalation can {{have a number of}} health implications. Bioaerosol dynamics can occur through a variety of mechanisms, among them <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> deposited <b>particles</b> due to human activity. Because the breathing zone of infants is at a much lower height than that of adults, there is reason to suspect that infants are exposed to greater concentrations of bioaerosols resuspended from the floor, though knowledge in this specific area is limited. To investigate, a mechanical infant was used to simulate crawling over carpeting and particle concentrations for varying size groups were recorded using an optical particle sizer (OPS) at heights corresponding to both infant and adult breathing zones. In addition, resuspension tests on the infant breathing zone were repeated following vacuuming of the carpets to observe the effect of vacuuming on exposure rates. Results show that, as a result of infant crawling, concentrations <b>of</b> resuspended <b>particles</b> are significantly higher in the infant breathing zone compared to the bulk air, which is reduced but not quite eliminated by vacuuming. In addition, the mechanisms governing particle concentrations in the breathing zone appears to differ from those of the bulk environment.

Its presence is {{a direct consequence of}} the historical mining activity in nearby Idrjia (Slovenia), as well as significant discharges from a chlor-alkali plant into the AussaeCorno river system, which connects to the lagoon. Previous studies have shown that sediment acts as secondary source of Hg species to the overlying water column in natural conditions.

In a subset of 10 dwellings, ultrafine particles (UFP; > 0, 01 μm) were also measured with a condensation particle counter (CPC) during one evening. Particles 1 -hour median levels vary between 4. 3 × 103 and 6 × 104 part/cm 3 for UFP and from 23 to 323 part/cm 3 for FP > 3 μm. Max/min ratios vary between dwellings from 10 to 257 for FP and up to 15 for UFP. The maximum concentration for either FP or UFP occurred between 7 and 9 pm corresponding systematically with the maximum occupation rate of the living room. Reported activities and carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring allow to determine the specific sources <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> indoors, i. e. specific activity (tobacco smoke, air freshener, cooking, etc.), occupation without activity (particle resuspension), combustion (high CO), and outdoors (windows opening). RELEVANCE: Particles are a major pollutant in the indoor environment with contributions from both outdoor and indoor sources. Crossing measurements with time-activity diaries allowed to determine the major occurrence <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> pollution in dwellings within a typical week and to identify the major sources <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> Occupation appears clearly to be a key factor as it implies the activation of direct or indirect sources (<b>resuspension)</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> (both UFP and FP).

40|$|Carbonate sediments on {{continental}} slopes in temperate {{areas have}} not received {{as much attention as}} their tropical counterparts. This study documents the sedimentology and main early diagenetic features of hemipelagic carbonate oozes from two piston cores from the continental slope of the south Balearic margin (western Mediterranean) between 38 ° and 39 °N. The two cores contain hemipelagic carbonate oozes consisting of a mixture of clay minerals and several carbonate phases, which settled on the flanks of the Balearic carbonate platform during the last full Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycle. Textural, faunal and mineralogical data suggest that the Balearic sedimentary record is closely related to changes in productivity, dissolution and dilution, all of which are related to δ 18 O and δ 13 C signals during the Late Quaternary. The dominant carbonate phase is low-magnesian calcite, whereas aragonite and high-magnesian calcite are present as minor components. The incorporation of low-magnesian calcite in the sediment is due to planktonic pelagic rain. The high-magnesian calcite is incorporated via <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> originating from the degradation of molluscan and red algal carbonate skeletons from the adjacent carbonate-rich Balearic shelves. Aragonite derives from pteropods and presumably shallow-water aragonite organisms, as the red algae Peyssonelia. The main differences between tropical carbonate slope sediments and Balearic temperate hemipelagic oozes are the lesser amounts of carbonate minerals, mainly aragonite and high-magnesian calcite, and the greater quantity of quartz and clay minerals. Our results suggest that the hemipelagic carbonate oozes of the Balearic slope are an intermediate type of carbonate oozes between the low-magnesian calcite deep-pelagic oozes with low diagenetic potential and the multiphasal carbonate tropical periplatform sediments with high diagenetic potential.

40|$|Due to its {{adverse effects}} on human health, {{atmospheric}} particulate matter (PM) constitutes a growing challenge for air quality management. It is also a complex subject of study. The understanding of its atmospheric evolution is indeed made difficult by the wide number of sources and the numerous processes that govern its evolution in the troposphere. As a consequence, the representation of particulate matter in chemistry-transport models needs to be permanently evaluated and enhanced in order to refine our comprehension of PM pollution events and to propose consistent environmental policies. The study presented here focuses on a summer particulate pollution episode that occurred on the French Mediterranean coast. It aims at identifying the constitutive elements of this episode and to discuss its representation within a eulerian model. We first highlight the major role of dust transport from western Africa {{in the formation of}} a multi-day PM event. This result shows that dust import has to be regarded as a potentially major participant to PM events in Europe, even when considering moderate peak values. In parallel we focus on a lack of diurnal variability in the model, which is attributed to missing urban sources in standard emission inventories, and notably the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> by urban road traffic. Through a sensitivity study based on PM and NOx measurements, we could assess the amplitude of this lack as well as the need to reconsider road traffic PM sources. In parallel, by coupling the CHIMERE-DUST model outputs to our simulation, we could show that the representation of transcontinental dust transport is a necessity for a better simulation <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>particles</b> in Southern Europe, and – in the frame of air quality management – for the quantification of the anthropogenic part of particulate matter pollution...|$|R
40|$|The flow induced motion <b>of</b> wall {{deposited}} <b>particles</b> {{is highly}} {{linked with the}} instantaneous fluid structures. Here we perform a two-phase flow DNS to analyze the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> solid <b>particles</b> from a surface hit by a transonic jet into a low pressure container in conditions similar to those which occur in a fusion reactor vacuum vessel during a Loss of Vacuum Accident (LOVA). The initial condition of pressure and temperature were set to 49. 5 mbar and 373 K, with a Reynolds number of 3300 on a 512 512 512 grid properly refined in regions where high gradients are present. The Thornton and Ning impact/adhesion model is adopted, whereas an advanced resuspension model, which also {{takes into account the}} dynamics (rolling and sliding) <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> at the wall, is here implemented. The initial deposited particles follow a log-normal distribution with a count median diameter of 2. 21 μm, geometric standard deviation of 2. 93 and constant density of 8527 kg/m 3. It has been found that the resuspension phenomenon mostly affect <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> the biggest diameters. Moreover, the jet-deposit interaction is for the most part confined within a circumference around the jet of radius equal to the jet diamete...|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{provided}} the observations needed for developing models capable of calculating pathogen survival under particle attached condition, {{which is not}} well established. The mechanism that could explain the study findings is that sediment particles provide improved nutrient availability and resistance to heat stress. As a result, the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> sediment <b>particles</b> sustains individual pathogens and ultimately enhances the pathogen population in stream water (Craig et al. 2001; Droppo et al. 2011; Mueller-Spitz et al. 2010; Pandey and Soupir 2013; Pandey et al. 2016). Despite the common understanding of enhanced pathogen survival in sediment, there is a knowledge gap in terms of changes in pathogen survival and decay kinetics under particle attached conditions during resuspension (Brookes et al. 2004; Hipsey et al. 2008; Pachepsky and Shelton 2011), {{and the results of}} this study provide the much needed additional information to fill the knowledge gap. Further, considering the increased uses of thermal springs for bathing purposes, the scope of this study is wide.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the benthic foraminiferal fauna from sediment event layers associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and former storms that have been retrieved in short sediment cores from offshore environments of the Andaman Sea, off Khao Lak, western Thailand. Species composition and test preservation of the benthic foraminiferal faunas exhibit pronounced changes across the studied sections and provide information on the depositional history of the tsunami layer, particularly on the source water depth of the displaced foraminiferal tests. In order to obtain accurate bathymetric information on sediment provenance, we have mapped the distribution of modern faunas in non-tsunamigenic surface sediments and created a calibration data set {{for the development of}} a transfer function. Our quantitative reconstructions revealed that the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> sediment <b>particles</b> by the tsunami wave was restricted to a maximum water depth of approximately 20 m. Similar values were obtained for former storm events, thus impeding an easy distinction of different high-energy events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSediments in the Deûle River (northern France) are {{severely}} polluted by metals {{in the vicinity}} of several metallurgical plants. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the role played by the recurrent <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> these polluted sediments by boat traffic on the dissolved Pb and Zn concentrations in the river. For that purpose, several high-frequency on-line monitoring campaigns were performed. Our results clearly suggest that the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> sedimentary <b>particles</b> into the overlying water significantly increased the dissolved electrolabile Pb and Zn contents. This increase does not persist for a long time because at night and during weekends and holidays, when the boat traffic strongly slows down, Pb and Zn concentrations drop again quickly. Our data also indicate that the biological processes (such as photosynthetic and respiration activities), diffusive and benthic fluxes, as well as dilution of pore water into the overlying water during sediment remobilization do not contribute significantly to the sharp increase of dissolved Pb and Zn concentrations in the river during the day. The good correlation between turbidity and electrolabile metal concentration allows us to discard slow AVS (Acid Volatile Sulfides) oxidation as well. Desorption of metals from sediment particles was clearly the most relevant process, responsible for the increase of dissolved Pb and Zn concentrations in the water column...|$|R
