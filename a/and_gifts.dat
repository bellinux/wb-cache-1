5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an {{irrigation}} channel by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with leeches, the water saved the group from dying of thirst. Marching {{for another two}} days, they reached the vicinity of Herat, where they made contact with Afghan authorities. Unsure what reception awaited them, von Hentig sent Barkatullah, an Islamic scholar of some fame, to advise the governor that the expedition had arrived and was bearing the Kaiser's message <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> for the Emir. The governor sent a grand welcome, with noblemen bearing cloths <b>and</b> <b>gifts,</b> a caravan of servants, and a column of hundred armed escorts. The expedition was invited into the city as guests of the Afghan government. With von Hentig in the lead in his Cuirassiers uniform, they entered Herat on 24 August, in a procession welcomed by Turkish troops. They were housed at the Emir's provincial palace. They were officially met by the governor {{a few days later}} when, according to British agents, von Hentig showed him the Turkish Sultan's proclamation of jihad and announced the Kaiser's promise to recognise Afghan sovereignty and provide German assistance. The Kaiser also promised to grant territory to Afghanistan as far north as Samarkand in Russian Turkestan and as far into India as Bombay.|$|E
5|$|During the Third Republic (1870–1940) the Louvre {{acquired}} new pieces mainly via donations <b>and</b> <b>gifts.</b> The Société des Amis du Louvre {{donated the}} Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau.|$|E

5|$|In 1191, {{the king}} {{confirmed}} the monastery {{and its surrounding}} fields as belonging to the Cistercian Order. The aged abbot of Santa María de Huerta, bishop Martín de Finojosa (later canonized), consecrated the church in September 1213 and died days later. The surrounding area of Murel and Trillo along the Tagus prospered, giving tithes <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> of land to the monastery. The cartulary, Cartulario de Óvila, is preserved at the University of Madrid.|$|E

He arrives at Sugar's party early to discover his admirer is actually former bully Karofsky (Max Adler), who declares his love for Kurt. Kurt lets him down gently, but their parting words are overheard by a classmate of Karofsky's, and Karofsky flees.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{returned}} to Durham on 11 September 1091, {{with a large}} sum of money <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> for his church. Thereafter he remained in the king's favour. In fact, in 1093 his lands were restored without the need to perform feudal services. For {{the rest of his}} life, St-Calais remained a frequent advisor to the king. It was St-Calais, along with Robert, Count of Meulan who negotiated with Anselm, the abbot of Bec, in 1093 over the conditions under which Anselm would allow himself to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{on the one}} hand, {{this work}} adds color <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> into {{the long list of}} {{influential}} factors to consumer return behavior. We find that both, color <b>and</b> extra <b>gifts,</b> can significantly decrease consumer’s return intentions by adding extra perceived utilities. On the other hand, this study also enriches color <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> research by demonstrating their positive influences on the post-purchase behavior. By integrating literatures on color psychology, promotion, and consumer return behavior, we discovered that colors <b>and</b> extra <b>gifts</b> can influence both purchase and return decisions.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} {{collection of}} Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) {{became part of}} the Wittliff collections of Southwestern Writers, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend Bill Wittliff, who wrote or co-wrote Honeysuckle Rose, Barbarosa and Red Headed Stranger. In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> and tributes from Nelson's fans.|$|E
5|$|King Æthelberht {{converted}} to Christianity {{and allowed the}} missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at London, and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor, Laurence of Canterbury. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a saint.|$|E
5|$|Prospective colourists at A. Farsari & Co. {{were interviewed}} by Farsari himself, who ensured they were {{familiar}} with Japanese painting techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses <b>and</b> <b>gifts.</b> On the other hand, Farsari complained {{in a letter to}} his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E

5|$|Schindler's {{ties with}} the Abwehr and his {{connections}} in the Wehrmacht and its Armaments Inspectorate enabled him to obtain contracts to produce enamel cookware for the military. These connections also later helped him protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death. As time went on, Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> of luxury items obtainable only on the black market, to keep his workers safe. Bankier, a key black market connection, obtained goods for bribes as well as extra materials {{for use in the}} factory. Schindler himself enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and pursued extramarital relationships with his secretary, Viktoria Klonowska, and Eva Kisch Scheuer, a merchant specialising in enamelware from DEF. Emilie Schindler visited for a few months in 1940 and moved to Kraków to live with Oskar in 1941.|$|E

5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates <b>and</b> <b>gifts,</b> as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E

5|$|The Kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar {{were used}} for drawing the {{carriages}} of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals. The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> for allied cities. The horse was known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The Liber {{covers the}} period from the {{founding}} of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during {{the latter part of the}} 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the Liber chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, Æthelthryth, <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> of land to Ely.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no {{evidence}} of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E

5|$|Wade is {{well known}} for his philanthropic {{involvement}} in various organizations. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations. He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida. In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.

In addition, Wade donated some furnishings, clothing, <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> to the family for the holiday.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{apparent}} success, Bedouin power was fragile, as the Jarrahids proved susceptible to bribery. Al-Hakim sent large sums <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> to Mufarrij and his sons, with Hassan in return sending back the grandsons of Jawhar al-Siqilli, {{who had been}} entrusted to his care, to be executed. Abu'l-Futuh began to have second thoughts, as the Jarrahids increasingly treated him disrespectfully after the money he had brought with him ran out. Eventually he returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance. Abu'l-Qasim too feared a Jarrahid rapprochement with the Fatimids, and fled for Iraq, eventually rising to become a vizier for the Marwanid and Uqaylid rulers of the Jazira. Finally, in July/August 1013, al-Hakim sent a 24,000-strong army under Ali ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah against the Bedouin. The latter were heavily defeated {{in the field and}} lost Ramlah. Ali and Mahmud surrendered, and at the same time, Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned by agents of the Caliph. Thereupon Hassan too secured a pardon, and managed to retain his father's lands in Palestine. Although initially loyal to the Fatimids, he too held ambitions to rule Palestine as an autonomous ruler. From 1024, he launched a series of rebellions, allied with the Christians of Palestine and the Byzantines. Like his father, however, he failed to achieve but ephemeral success.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Estate Tax was {{introduced}} in 1916, <b>and</b> <b>Gift</b> Tax in 1924. Unlike many inheritance taxes, the <b>Gift</b> <b>and</b> Estate taxes were imposed on the transferor rather than the recipient.

These taxes remained under 1% of government revenues through the 1990s.|$|R
