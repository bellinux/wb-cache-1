5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> more consistently.|$|E
