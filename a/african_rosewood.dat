5000|$|Despite the {{implication}} of this commonly used name, the Irish flute is not an instrument indigenous to Ireland. The simple system, conical-bore flute is what people played {{before the advent of}} the modern, Boehm system, Western concert flute in the mid-19th century. Simple-system flutes are usually made of wood (cocus, grenadilla (<b>African</b> blackwood), <b>rosewood,</b> ebony, etc.). There were several manufacturers of this type of flute, among whom was English inventor and flautist Charles Nicholson Jr, who developed a radically improved version of the transverse wooden flute.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{objective}} and subjective experiments on brass instruments, organs, flutes and clarinets {{have shown that}} the influence of material was weak. Yet, the influence of wood on the sound of oboes is still to be determined. In this study, short musical recordings of ten French 16 ″ bagpipes made of 5 different woods (<b>African</b> Ebony, Santos <b>Rosewood,</b> Boxwood, <b>African</b> Blackwood and Service Tree) were presented to subjects (specialist and naïve), who had to give their feedback on several criteria (global quality, warmth, aggressiveness, brightness, volume and attack precision). The choice of a bagpipe rather than a simple oboe enables to minimize the influence of the musician, as he is not directly in contact with the reed. An influence of the reed material was found, but no influence of the wood. In a second experiment, a discrimination task allowed to confirm that the differences between chanters were not principally due to the wood. Several physical parameters calculated from recorded signals could also not reveal any large differences between woods...|$|R

50|$|Guibourtia coleosperma, aka <b>African</b> <b>rosewood</b> (ambiguous), large false mopane, Rhodesian copalwood, and machibi, is {{a species}} of Guibourtia in the family Fabaceae. It is a large {{evergreen}} tree (to 20 m tall) found in open woodland and dry forest, almost exclusively on Kalahari Sand in Angola, southern Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} in English as African redwood, East <b>African</b> <b>rosewood,</b> [...] brayera, cusso, hagenia, or kousso, in Amharic as kosso, and in Swahili as mdobore or mlozilozi. It is the sole species of genus Hagenia, and its closest {{relative}} is the Afromontane genus Leucosidea. Synonyms include Banksia abyssinica, Brayera anthelmintica, Hagenia abyssinica var. viridifolia and Hagenia anthelmintica.|$|E
50|$|The timberline {{forest is}} usually found between 3000 m and 3500 m, {{although}} it extends to lower altitudes on the drier slopes.Smaller trees dominate in the timberline forest, and the characteristic trees are <b>African</b> <b>rosewood</b> (Hagenia abyssinica) and giant St. John's wort (Hypericum). The common flowers are red-hot poker (Kniphofia thomsonii), violets (Viola spp.), and giant forest lobelias (Lobelia bambuseti and Lobelia gibberoa).|$|E
50|$|Despite its aridity, the Kalahari Basin {{supports}} {{a variety of}} fauna and flora on soils known as Kalahari sands. The native flora includes acacia trees, <b>African</b> <b>Rosewood</b> {{and a large number}} of herbs and grasses. Some of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species and, in the rainy season tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.|$|E
50|$|Savanna and the Sahel {{habitats}} are of two types. One is {{the southern}} Guinea savanna which has rich and dense vegetation of over 50 tree species. The {{other is the}} Sudan Savanna which is contiguous to the Guinea savanna on the north bank of the Gambia River. These areas are dry woodlands with soils of laterite formations. The local tree species include silk cotton (Bombax costatum), dry-zone mahogany (Khaya Senagalensis) in deeper soil areas and <b>African</b> <b>rosewood</b> (Guibourtia coleosperma). Short grasses and shrubs are seen thinly spread in the Sahelian habitats.|$|E

5000|$|Millettia laurentii is a legume tree from Africa {{and native}} to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The species is listed as [...] "endangered" [...] in the IUCN Red List, principally due to {{destruction}} of its habitat and over-exploitation for timber. Wenge, a dark colored wood, {{is the product of}} Millettia laurentii. Other names sometimes used for wenge include <b>African</b> <b>rosewood</b> (ambiguous), faux ebony, dikela, mibotu, bokonge, and awong. The wood's distinctive color is standardized as a [...] "wenge" [...] color in many systems.|$|E

50|$|For years, Brazilian Rosewood was the {{industry}} standard as the best wood for the backs and sides of guitars. Unfortunately, the export of Brazilian Rosewood has been restricted due to the endangerment of the species. Much of the Brazilian Rosewood used for guitars is of poor quality, and the inflated price of the wood has caused many luthiers to search for alternative tonewoods. There are many other good very dry woods for guitar construction. In fact, of the surviving Torres instruments, the most common back and side wood used was maple. Many guitars made today use East Indian Rosewood {{because it is a}} close substitute for Brazilian Rosewood, is readily available in high-quality, and has desirable characteristics as tonewood. There are many other woods with the characteristics to make excellent guitars and are excellent alternatives: cocobolo, maple, bubinga (<b>African</b> <b>Rosewood),</b> African Blackwood, Camatillo Rosewood, Spanish Cypress (used exclusively for flamenco guitars), granadillo, ebony, satinwood, ziricote, among others, are excellent choices for backs and sides.|$|E
