5|$|In 1971, Roberts won the AMA Rookie of the Year Award. In {{his first}} {{professional}} race {{as an expert}} class rider in 1972, Roberts rode to victory at the Grand National short-track race in the Houston <b>Astrodome.</b> Roberts {{made a name for}} himself that year by battling the dominant Harley-Davidson factory dirt track team aboard an underpowered Yamaha XS 650 motorcycle, making up for his lack of horsepower with sheer determination. He finished the season ranked fourth in the country. In 1973, in just his second season as an expert, Roberts won the national championship, amassing a record 2,014 points in the 25-race series.|$|E
5|$|In February 1980, Roberts made a {{remarkable}} {{return to the}} American Grand National Championship for two races at the season opening Houston TT and short-track events held in the Houston <b>Astrodome</b> over two evenings.

He followed that the next evening with a third place in the Houston short-track national. Returning to England once again for the 1980 Transatlantic Match races, Roberts was once again the top individual points scorer as he led the American team to victory over the British.|$|E
5|$|Manila also hosts several {{well-known}} {{sports facilities}} {{such as the}} Enrique M.

Other collegiate sports are still held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Professional basketball also used to play at the city, but the Philippine Basketball Association now holds their games at Araneta Coliseum and Cuneta <b>Astrodome</b> at Pasay; the now defunct Philippine Basketball League played some of their games at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1993 season, the Jets {{obtained}} Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, who {{had worked}} with Coslet in Cincinnati. Steinberg signed veteran safety Ronnie Lott to shore up the defense. O'Brien's career with the Jets ended with an offseason trade to the Green Bay Packers, and running back Freeman McNeil retired after twelve seasons. The Jets suffered another December collapse: they lost four of their last five to finish 8–8. The Jets would have made the playoffs by winning their last game, but were shut out at the <b>Astrodome</b> by the Oilers. Following the season, Steinberg fired Coslet and replaced him with defensive coordinator Pete Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} a city {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the <b>Astrodome</b> and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, {{which may be}} {{explained}} by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the <b>Astrodome,</b> that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.|$|E
50|$|Stadium Park/Astrodome is {{an island}} platformed METRORail light rail station in Houston, Texas, United States.

The station {{is located at the}} intersection of Fannin Street and Holly Hall Street, next to NRG Park. This station is decorated with various photographs from The <b>Astrodome's</b> history including the Rodeo, the Houston Astros and an Elvis concert.|$|R
50|$|The {{decade of}} the 1990s {{had not been a}} good one for UH football. Since the almost magical 10-1 season of 1990 in which they held a No. 3 ranking into November, the Cougars had since failed to crack the AP Top 25 and had gone to only one bowl game. The team's poor on-field {{performance}} had not been kind to fan interest. Attendance had slipped slowly downward throughout the decade, and the team often played in front of home crowds of fewer than 20,000 fans. The program also lacked stability in the athletic department after several changes at athletic director. Clearly, significant change was needed for the program to break out of its cycle of apathy. In a move to alleviate the financial burden of paying rent to the <b>Astrodome's</b> operators, Athletic Director Chet Gladchuk began a drive to renovate Robertson Stadium to modern standards and move all home football games back to campus {{for the first time since}} the 1940s. This idea became a reality in the 1998 season, and significant renovations to the 60-year-old stadium were completed the following year.|$|R
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston <b>Astrodome</b> when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like <b>Astrodome</b> interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E
