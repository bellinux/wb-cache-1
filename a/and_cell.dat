40|$|Isolation and {{characterization}} of lung epithelial stem <b>and</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> {{understanding of their}} specific role in lung physiopathology are critical for preventing and controlling lung diseases including lung cancer. In this review, we summarized recent advances in classification and research methods of lung epithelial stem <b>and</b> progenitor <b>cells.</b> Lung epithelial stem <b>and</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> were region-specific, which primarily included basal <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> duct <b>cells</b> in proximal airway, Clara cells, variant Clara cells, bronchioalveolar stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> induced krt 5 + cells in bronchioles, type II alveolar <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> type II alveolar progenitor cells in alveoli. The research methods of lung epithelial stem <b>and</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> were mainly focused on lung injury models, lineage-tracing experiments, three dimensional culture, transplantation, chronic labeled <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> single-cell transcriptome analysis. Lastly, the potential relationship between lung epithelial stem <b>and</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> lung cancer as well as lung cancer stem cell-targeted drug development were briefly reviewed...|$|R

5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prion structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|E

Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E

5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E

Apical dendrites from pyramidal cells in the external granular layer and more prominently the external pyramidal layer project into the molecular layer.

5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their cytosol. Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E

Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E

5|$|Lactacystin, {{a natural}} product {{synthesized}} by Streptomyces bacteria, {{was the first}} non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered and is widely used as a research tool in biochemistry <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> biology. Lactacystin was licensed to Myogenics/Proscript, which was acquired by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, now part of Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino-terminal threonine of catalytic β subunits of the proteasome, particularly the β5 subunit responsible for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity. This discovery helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease.|$|E

5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) is a {{polypeptide}} hormone that mediates {{a broad range}} of biological activities and interacts with surface receptors on numerous cell types. Equilibrium binding studies have identified a class of IL- 1 receptors on T <b>cells,</b> fibroblasts, <b>and</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> that have 2 - to 5 -fold higher affinity than the receptors on bone marrow <b>cells,</b> pre-B <b>cells,</b> <b>and</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> lines. Affinity cross-linking with human 125 I-labeled IL- 1 alpha (125 I-IL- 1 alpha) labels an approximately 100 -kDa protein on T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts and an approximately 80 -kDa protein on pre-B <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> lines. Monoclonal <b>and</b> polyclonal antibodies specific for the IL- 1 receptor on T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts block human 125 I-IL- 1 alpha binding to T <b>cells,</b> fibroblasts, <b>and</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> but cannot block IL- 1 binding to bone marrow <b>cells,</b> pre-B <b>cells,</b> <b>and</b> macrophages.

An S 1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated that T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts contain identical IL- 1 receptor mRNA but that pre-B <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> macrophages do not contain this receptor mRNA.
