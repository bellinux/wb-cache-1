60|$|CATHLEEN. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> Oona, my nurse, {{should have}} remembered it, For {{we were happy}} {{for a long time}} there.|$|E
6000|$|... "She'll hop no {{more for}} me," [...] said George Robinson, sternly. But {{on this matter}} he was weak as water, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> was able to turn him round her little finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{sure that}} I have but one desire, to know you, Lord, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> whom, being mad, you seek so madly, far from Cuzco and never {{to look upon}} your face again." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, {{her head against}} the tree trunk--long <b>and</b> steadfastly-- <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who could see the naked soul.|$|R
50|$|The Women Cross {{demilitarized zone}} (DMZ) group, which {{includes}} noted American feminist and activist Gloria Steinem, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer Christine Ahn with other activist women members, have conducted a peace symposium in Pyongyang on May 20, 2015 <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>women</b> group {{walked across the}} DMZ, separating North and South Korea for peace on May 24, 2015.|$|R
50|$|Captain Yolanda Ruiz is {{in charge}} of Joe's police precinct <b>and</b> <b>this</b> feisty <b>woman</b> {{recently}} married Crunchy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you were}} there and you know, of course, but I should have thought the last thing Gussie <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> would {{have done in the}} circs. would have been to start singing duets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} priest, [...] "deliver me over Torfrida the younger, {{daughter}} of Hereward <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> that I may {{take her to}} the King, who has found a fit husband for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{this the}} {{surprise}} you held {{in store for}} me?" [...] he cried. [...] "You assured me that no obstacle which might not be easily overcome stood between me <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> and now I find that the one insuperable obstacle intervenes. What mean you, man? What have you to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the hour}} Faith foresaw; Moor {{had gone to}} her with his trouble, why not follow, <b>and</b> let <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> wise, discreet, <b>and</b> gentle, show her what should come next? ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. Good heavens, no! What a lot {{you expect}} from your very mild sins! You <b>and</b> <b>this</b> young <b>woman</b> have lived together, then? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look here, Miner, if you {{was half}} a man, you'd pull out <b>and</b> leave <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> in peace. How {{you can stand}} around here and occupy the {{position}} you do, I don't see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, after all, what is {{the good}} of talking in this way?" [...] exclaimed Chatteris abruptly. [...] "I am simply trying to elevate the whole {{business}} by dragging in these wider questions. It's justification, when I didn't mean to justify. I {{have to choose between}} life with Adeline <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> out of the sea." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} that for the moment I lost my self-possession. I had gone through so much {{during the last few}} hours, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> spoke with such confidence--so quietly, and yet with such {{absolute}} conviction--that I felt the barriers which I had built about myself crumbling away. I answered her lamely, and without conviction.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he won't,--no {{married man}} ever is," [...] said Miss Grace, wiping her eyes, and sitting up very straight. [...] "No man, {{that is a}} gentleman, is ever master in his own house. He has only such rights there as his wife chooses to give him; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> won't like me, I'm sure." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARLOW. That you <b>and</b> <b>this</b> young <b>woman</b> {{were married}} {{in the sight of}} heaven, or through eternity, or {{something}} similar, but that you couldn't make up your minds to it on earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Here shall you {{be beaten}} {{before all the}} world <b>and</b> <b>this</b> shameless <b>woman</b> who would, with her own hand, take you by the ear and call such sacrilege marriage! Stay, shameless woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|And he thinks, {{with the}} {{interest}} of attentive curiosity, as he watches the struggle in her breast, [...] "The power <b>and</b> force of <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> are astonishing!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{claim for}} my countrymen and women, {{our right to}} true history. For years, the popular {{literature}} has held up publicly before our eyes the facts as to this man <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> and called on us to praise or condemn. Let us have truth when we are called on to judge. It is our right.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> says, [...] "My {{days were}} sunless and my nights were [...] moonless, [...] Parched the {{pleasant}} April herbage, and the lark's heart's outbreak [...] tuneless, [...] If you loved me not!" [...] And I who--(ah, for words of flame!) adore [...] her, [...] Who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her-- ...|$|E
60|$|In that day, God, {{who will}} judge {{the secrets of}} all men, will judge between this man <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b> Then, if never before, the full truth shall be told both of the depraved and dissolute man who made it his life's object to defame the innocent, and the silent, the self-denying woman who made it her life's object to give space for repentance to the guilty.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{first wife}} was a poor match for him, though," [...] said Mrs. Waule. [...] "She brought him nothing: <b>and</b> <b>this</b> young <b>woman</b> is only her niece,--and very proud. And my brother has always paid her wage." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I couldnâ€™t do it. It {{would kill}} her love for me. <b>And</b> now about <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>this</b> Mrs. Cheveley. How can I defend myself against her? You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{conflicting}} evidence was introduced during the trial. Arguments {{on both sides}} during the trial reflected racial mythology of the time. For example, Upton argued that Miller {{could not be a}} quartronne (1/16 Negro) because [...] "the Quartronne is idle, reckless <b>and</b> extravagant, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is industrious, careful and prudent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] I answered; [...] "I am Naass, head man of Akatan, {{the last}} of the blood, as you are {{the last of}} the blood." [...] 'And she laughed. By all the things I have seen and the deeds I have done may I never hear such a laugh again. It put the chill to my soul, sitting there in the White Silence, alone with death <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who laughed.|$|E
60|$|Horrified, sick at heart, we {{continued}} our journey. No {{wonder that the}} Khania hated such a mad despot. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> {{was in love with}} Leo, and this lunatic Khan, her husband, was a victim to jealousy, which he avenged after the very unpleasant fashion that we had witnessed. Truly an agreeable prospect for all of us! Yet, I could not help reflecting, as an object lesson that horrid scene had its advantages.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not, {{four men}} whose faces were masked. They said also that though you must die, they were {{commanded}} {{to do me}} <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> no harm, only to bind and silence us. This they did, then, having taken what money they could find, went out to waylay you. Afterwards I heard a scuffle in the arch and well-nigh died of sorrow, for I who could neither warn nor help you, was sure that you were perishing beneath their knives." ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately a {{neighbor}} arrived just at <b>this</b> moment, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> good <b>woman,</b> {{aided by the}} squire, soon revived the widow. At the end of ten minutes she sat up in a chair, her face as white as a sheet.|$|R
60|$|To James' {{great relief}} {{they reached the}} house at last; the silence <b>and</b> impenetrability of <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> by his side, whom he had always thought so soft and mild, alarmed him.|$|R

60|$|The {{carriage}} {{drove away}} and I {{walked back to}} the house. The air seemed full of voices, and the grey rising mists loomed into strange shapes. Cruta! She was going to Cruta! What power had this man in his hands to send my lover from me with a heart like a stone, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> back into the living hell from which she had just freed herself. It was my turn now! Would he be able to subdue me to his bidding? The thought made me shudder.|$|E
6000|$|But Sir Richard, {{watching}} him intently, {{shook his head}} and fetched a sigh of sorrow and disdain. [...] "Pshaw, Justin! How we befool ourselves! You think it is not so; you try to think it is not so; but to me it is very plain. A woman has arisen in your life, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> seen but once or twice, unknown a week or so ago, suffices to eclipse the memory of your mother and turns your aim in life--the avenging of her bitter wrongs--to water. Oh, Justin, Justin! I had thought you stronger." ...|$|E
6000|$|Riggs walked {{towards the}} window, turned, and coming back, {{held out his}} hand. [...] "Yes, she did it; and I thanked her, as I thank you." [...] He stopped and hesitated, as the other took his hand. [...] "But, blank it all, Chivers, don't you see that Alice is a young girl, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is--you know what I mean. Somebody might {{recognize}} HER, {{and that would be}} worse for Alice than even if it were known what Alice's BROTHER was. G--d! if these two things were put together, the girl would be ruined forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have more}} copyists {{than they need}} now; <b>and,</b> in fact, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> does not write the sort of hand at all that would enable her to get on as a copyist." ...|$|R
