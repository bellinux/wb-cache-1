40|$|BackgroundCutaneous adverse drug {{reactions}} frequently {{present as}} a benign maculopapular exanthema (MPE) with a rapid healing. Sometimes systemic signs are present, which could represent a more severe or systemic MPE (sMPE) or even be the initial {{phase of a}} drug reaction with eosinophilia <b>and</b> systemic symptoms (<b>DRESS).</b> Histopathology associated with MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS</b> has not been well characterized. ObjectivesTo study the cutaneous histopathological changes associated with MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> MethodsA retrospective clinicopathological analysis of 13 cases of MPE, 13 of sMPE <b>and</b> 45 of <b>DRESS,</b> collected in one centre from 2005 to 2013. ResultsThe number of histopathological changes per section increased gradually from MPE to sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Prevalence of spongiosis, dermal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils did not differ between MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Keratinocyte damage, rare in MPE, was regularly found in sMPE <b>and</b> frequent in <b>DRESS.</b> The density of the inflammatory infiltrate increased progressively from MPE to sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Atypical lymphocytes were absent in MPE, present in sMPE and more frequent in DRESS. Deep dermal involvement and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were only observed in DRESS. LimitationsThis was a retrospective study.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate how perceived stressful conditions (PSC) and perceived non-stressful conditions (PNSC) influence eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> behaviors of Chinese females. Chinese female university students (18 – 30  years) residing in the United States, completed a validated and reliable 45 -itemized Chinese Stress Eating <b>and</b> <b>Dressing</b> Survey (CSEDS). The CSEDS included: (i) effort to control making healthy eating choices <b>and</b> <b>dressing,</b> (ii) foods eaten <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> items selected during PSC, (iii) foods eaten <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> items selected during PNSC, and (iv) demographics. Seven comfort food categories and eight appearance categories were used. The CSEDS included multiple choice, yes/no, and Likert scale questions. Statistical analyses were performed using t tests. A total of 129 females completed the CSEDS. Mean body mass index (BMI) calculated from reported heights and weights was 20.86  ±  3.86. From PNSC to PSC, there were significant decreases in all dressing patterns (p < . 028), and the majority of the participants reported dressing casually during PSC (78.3 %). Overall, there was a decrease in the types of foods eaten during PNSC to PSC, but significance was noted for common foods (e.g., Chinese, Other Asian, Italian, American, and Mexican; p = . 033), mixed dishes (e.g., casseroles, soy and vegetable based dishes, meat entrees, and salads; p = . 018), and soft foods (e.g., rice, noodles, bread, dumplings, and eggs; p = . 003). During PSC, Chinese females tended to select a limited variety of foods, forgo appearance enhancement items, <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> casually suggesting that ethnic groups vary in eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> behaviors. Findings from this research contribute to the body of knowledge related to stress and its influence on appearance (eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing)</b> behaviors specifically of Chinese female university students when transitioning from one country to another.|$|R
