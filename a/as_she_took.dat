On 1 May, she departed {{as part of a}} group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> off for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.|$|E

The following year {{he went on to}} test the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner which first flew in 1949. On 23 May 1952 he flew the Comet—now a highly successful export—carrying the recently widowed Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on a four-hour tour around the Alps. At one point he supervised the Queen Mother <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> the controls. She was to dine with members of the No. 600 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron later that night and was anxious to say she had piloted an aircraft. Cunningham continued to test-fly prototypes such as the re-built Comet 3 and 4 in the late 1950s. On 23 October 1956 he travelled to the United States and received the Harmon Trophy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was the most prestigious American trophy for services of civil aviation.|$|E

500|$|Between 1935 and 1940 Akhmatova composed, {{worked and}} {{reworked}} the long poem Requiem in secret, a lyrical cycle of lamentation and witness, depicting {{the suffering of}} the common people under Soviet terror. She carried it with her as she worked and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. It was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. It consists of ten numbered poems that examine a series of emotional states, exploring suffering, despair, devotion, rather than a clear narrative. Biblical themes such as Christ's crucifixion and the devastation of Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdelene, reflect the ravaging of Russia, particularly witnessing the harrowing of women in the 1930s. It represented, to some degree, a rejection of her own earlier romantic work <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> on the public role as chronicler of the Terror. [...] This is a role she holds to this day.|$|E

On July 26, 2006, Koda released her first photobook, Maroc; the book, photographed by Leslie Kee, was tied with her thirty-second single [...] "4 Hot Wave", which was released on the same day. Koda reclaimed the title of highest debut week sales for a female artist in 2006 with [...] "4 Hot Wave"; which also ranked second behind the KinKi Kids. [...] "4 Hot Wave" [...] is Koda's nineteenth consecutive single to debut in the Top Ten since [...] "Kiseki". Koda's next single, [...] "Yume no Uta / Futari de..." [...] (2006), was a musical first for Koda, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> full creative control over {{the production of the}} single and music video; she wrote the lyrics, chose the outfits, and produced the concepts for the videos of both songs. Koda then recorded a cover of the Bubblegum Brothers' [...] "Won't Be Long" [...] with label-mates Exile. [...] "Cherry Girl/Unmei" [...] was the last single Koda released before releasing her fifth album Black Cherry in December. Black Cherry became the first female studio album to stay atop the charts for four weeks since Ayumi Hamasaki's album Duty. At the end of 2006, Oricon named her the best-selling artist of 2006 with ¥12,702,200,000 profit (approximately $136,465,304), and Yahoo!

500|$|The {{concert was}} divided into four parts: Equestrian, Bedouin, GlamPunk and Disco. The Equestrian segment of the show began with images of Madonna, riding crop in hand, and horses cantering across windswept plains on the big screens. A giant disco ball was then lowered onstage, and opened like a flower bud to reveal Madonna inside. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> her dancers' reins, she {{performed}} [...] "Future Lovers/I Feel Love". This was followed by [...] "Get Together" [...] backed by her dancers in horse reins. She rode a carousel horse-like dancepole during [...] "Like a Virgin". The backdrops displayed the X-Ray of Madonna's broken bones, which she had during a previous accident. [...] "Jump" [...] followed this performance, where the dancers displayed the physical discipline parkour. After Madonna disappeared backstage, three of her dancers then revealed personal tragedies during an interlude called [...] "Confessions". The second segment titled Bedouin started with Madonna appearing on a mirrored crucifix to sing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] as a death toll of African AIDS victims counted down onscreen above her. She stepped down off the cross to perform [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] where two male dancers intertwined each other while displaying religious symbolism on the screens like blood corpuscles connecting to form symbols of hope and unity. Madonna brought a guest vocalist from her Confessions on a Dance Floor album onstage for [...] "Isaac", when a female dancer in an oversized Middle-Eastern burka danced within a cage with the backdrops displaying sand dunes. Madonna then recreated the dance-off scene from her [...] "Sorry" [...] music video live with her troupe for her performance of the song. The performance {{was followed by the}} song [...] "Like It Or Not" [...] where burlesque-style dancing was performed by Madonna {{with the help of a}} chair as a prop.

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated".

2500|$|It was Roundtree's {{successful}} {{defense of}} the black laborer accused of the 1964 murder of alleged Kennedy mistress Mary Pinchot Meyer that solidified her reputation in the Washington, D.C. legal community. [...] For a fee of one dollar, Roundtree took on the defense of Ray Crump, Jr., accused of the execution-style shooting of Meyer <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> her daily walk along the C & O Canal. [...] Crump, who had been found by police wandering along the towpath near {{the scene of the}} crime, was arrested on the word of an eyewitness who claimed Crump resembled the black man he had seen standing over Meyer's body moments after the murder. [...] He had then been indicted without a preliminary hearing. Convinced that Crump's limited mental capacity rendered him incapable of perpetrating a murder of such stealth and meticulousness, Roundtree took on the United States government in a July 1965 trial in which the notoriety of the victim drew record crowds of lawyers, law students, and reporters to the United States District Court.|$|E
