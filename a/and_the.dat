5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Princess <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cobbler, The Thief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond {{had already}} been on bad terms with Peter of Angoulême, Latin Patriarch of Antioch.
