Such dance seldom has any narrative. <b>A</b> group <b>dance</b> and <b>a</b> corps de ballet, <b>a</b> social partner <b>dance</b> and <b>a</b> pas de deux, differ profoundly. Even <b>a</b> solo <b>dance</b> may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.|$|R
