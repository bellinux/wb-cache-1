50|$|Most {{military}} {{combat aircraft}} have an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>indicator</b> among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely {{how close to}} the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).|$|E
50|$|This graph {{shows the}} stall angle, yet in {{practice}} most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling {{in terms of}} airspeed. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an airspeed indicator, but fewer aircraft have an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>indicator.</b> An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) {{for a range of}} weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.|$|E
50|$|In takeoff {{and landing}} {{operations}} from short runways, such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL back country flying, aircraft may {{be equipped with}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> or Lift Reserve Indicators.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{design of}} highly flexible wings, made of extremely light structures yet {{still capable of}} carrying {{a considerable amount of}} non-structural weights, requires significant effort. The complexity involved in such design demands for simplified mathematical tools based on appropriate reduced order models capable of predicting the accurate aeroelastic behaviour. The model presented in this paper is based on a consistent nonlinear beam model, capable of simulating the unconventional aeroelastic behaviour of flexible composite wings. The partial differential equations describing the wing dynamics are reduced to a dimensionless form in terms of three ordinary differential equations using a discretization technique, along with Galerkin&# 039;s method. Within this approach the nonlinear structural model an unsteady indicial based aerodynamic model with dynamic stall are coupled. Only three degrees of freedom in edgewise, flapwise, and torsion, are needed to describe efficiently the dynamics of the wing and to evaluate the sensitivity to system parameters, such as stiffness ratio, aspect ratio, and root <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Interesting design <b>indicators</b> will be highlighted. In addition to analytical results, a wind tunnel test article will be introduced to assess the validity of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, when Reynolds {{number is}} {{within the range of}} 10000 to 1000000, the {{horizontal}} component of the total pressure of flow around flat plate at high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as lift <b>of</b> high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> and the vertical component was regarded as drag <b>of</b> high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The horizontal component of total pressure at small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as shape drag, and the total drag coefficient at small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was considered to the sum of the shape drag and frictional drag at zero <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For the two states of large and small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the application scopes of the formulas of lift and drag coefficients were given. Final, the relations of lift and drag coefficients were obtained by eliminating all <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Research results show that lift- drag curve <b>of</b> small <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is parabola, and the lift- drag curve <b>of</b> high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is circle...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration {{recently}} {{released a statement}} that personal and homemade aircraft accidents could be reduced significantly {{with the addition of}} Angle of Attack information for the pilot. Installing most available devices on modern aircraft requires extensive fitting and modification at great expense. Furthermore, modification of older and vintage aircraft may not be desirable. The introduction of a simple, non-invasive device that provides the same information would increase safety and be marketable. Utilizing this opportunity and setting a range of requirements including cost, weight, ease of installation, and reliability, analysis was performed on different methods purposed to accomplish the stated design requirements. The solution selected uses a Hall Device switch (a magnetically actuated electronic switch), a 100 decibel buzzer contained by an interior component, and a vane assembly with magnetic base for position reference on the exterior component. The device transmits airflow information outside the cockpit to the pilot and mounts non-invasively. Adhering the two components to opposite sides of the canopy provides reliable data to the pilot in glider type aircraft, multiengine aircraft, and some single engine aircraft. The Icarus <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>indicator</b> proves that the concept of a non-invasive <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>indicator</b> is viable and serves its purpose as an experimental aviation device.

5000|$|The {{critical}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{which produces}} maximum lift coefficient.

5000|$|P-Factor is {{sometimes}} erroneously explained {{with the word}} [...] "bite", as in [...] "the descending blade has a bigger bite, or <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> than the ascending blade".

In order to better understand this concept, imagine a propeller aircraft moving forward with a 90° <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (vertical). This situation is identical to what a helicopter experiences, but a helicopter can reduce or increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> individual blades of the rotor (decreasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on the advancing blade, while increasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on the retreating blade) in order to keep the lift of the rotor disc balanced. Because the force of the air on the blades moving forwards through the arc is greater, they will produce more thrust than the blades that move backwards. If the blades of the rotor were unable to independently change their <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> there would be a constant backwards rolling motion due to the increased lift on the side of the rotor disc with the advancing blade. In a fixed-wing aircraft, there is usually no way to adjust the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> the individual blades of the propellers, therefore the pilot must contend with P-Factor and use the rudder to counteract the shift of thrust.|$|R
