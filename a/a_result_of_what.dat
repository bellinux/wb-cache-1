5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{married his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) over New Year's. However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married {{the two of them}} instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E
5|$|The {{degrading}} {{structure of}} Isbell resulted in some weakening as it accelerated toward Florida. At 22:00UTC on October14, the hurricane made landfall near Everglades City as a Category2 with sustained winds between 100 and 110mph (160 and 175km/h). Within five hours, the system cleared the Florida Peninsula and emerged over the western Atlantic Ocean north of West Palm Beach. The storm's passage over land resulted in notable weakening, though Isbell remained of hurricane-strength. During {{the afternoon of}} October15, the low that had formed the previous day induced a northward turn of the cyclone and directed it toward North Carolina, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as the}} Fujiwhara effect. Thereafter, the two systems began to intertwine as Isbell began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone; rapid weakening accompanied this phase. Isbell completed this process by 12:00UTC on October16 as it moved onshore near Morehead City, North Carolina. On October17 the two non-tropical systems merged into a single storm over the Outer Banks. Isbell's remnants emerged back over the Atlantic Ocean on October18 near the Delmarva Peninsula before accelerating northeast. The system was last noted on October19 as it moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E

Because the properties of an explosive compound is in some degree related to its density, which is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> with <b>what</b> pressure it is compressed during manufacture, the stages in a staged detonation may also come from each section having been pressed to a different density, giving it varying properties.|$|R
50|$|No Carthaginian {{records of}} the war exist today because when the city was {{destroyed}} in 146 BC by the Romans, the books from Carthage's library were distributed among the nearby African tribes.

25|$|The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund {{released}} a model community bill of rights, promoting laws that strip corporations of their personhood rights and elevating {{the rights of}} citizens, for occupy organizers to adopt locally. In December 2011, Occupy Homes embarked on a movement to assist home owners who had lost or were scheduled to lose their homes due to foreclosure as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they called the illegal practices used by banks that took advantage of consumers. The group planned to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.|$|E
25|$|In 550BC, Cyrus the Great, {{the son of}} Mandane and Cambyses I, {{took over}} the Median Empire, and founded the Achaemenid Empire by unifying other city states. The conquest of Media was <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is called the Persian Revolt. The brouhaha was {{initially}} triggered {{by the actions of}} Median ruler Astyages, and was quickly spread to other provinces, as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper, as well as the lands {{to the west of the}} Indus and Oxus rivers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Peter Paul was {{a lawyer}} in Miami, Florida, {{representing}} foreign governments and political leaders in South America and the Caribbean. He also served as President of the Miami World Trade Center and was the original owner and operator of the largest Foreign Trade Zone in the U.S., Miami Free Zone Inc. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Paul described as anti-Communist and anti-Castro political activities, he directed a fraud on the Cuban government of $8.75 million by selling agents of Cuban president Fidel Castro nonexistent coffee. The plan apparently also involved sinking the ship that was to deliver the nonexistent coffee to hide the fraud from Castro and, according to Time magazine, to defraud its insurer, but the conspirators neglected to bribe a port official in Santo Domingo, {{and the people who}} were supposed to scuttle the boat were not allowed on board.|$|E

2500|$|Eritrea {{discovered}} {{that it would be}} cheaper to build its network of railways with local expertise and resources rather than to spend aid money on foreign consultants and engineers. US law, backed by strong farm interests, requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is spent is used on transport. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> tying aid is estimated to increase the cost of aid by 15–30%.

Liz congratulates them and tells the two that their son will have an old dad as Jack is in his early 50s. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz said, Jack fears {{that he will not}} be around so he decides to teach his unborn son how to live by {{recording}} a video containing advice for him. Later, Jack learns that he and Avery are in fact expecting a daughter and not a son.

500|$|Unemployment {{originally}} {{rose from}} 4.2percent in January 2001 to 6.3percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5percent as of July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as the}} [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." [...] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2percent.|$|E
500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{one reporter}} called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term [...] "Polack" [...] to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as [...] "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating [...] "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." [...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize [...] "white backlash" [...] into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as [...] "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Thompson {{testified against}} those {{responsible}} for the My Lai Massacre. Twenty-six officers and enlisted soldiers, including William Calley and Ernest Medina, were charged with criminal offenses, but all were either acquitted or pardoned. Thompson was condemned and ostracized by many individuals in the United States military and government, as well as the public, {{for his role in the}} investigations and trials concerning the My Lai massacre. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he experienced, Thompson suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, divorce, and severe nightmare disorder. Despite the adversity he faced, he remained in the United States Army until November 1, 1983, and continued to make a living as a helicopter pilot in the southeastern United States.|$|R

40|$|The author´s {{proposal}} {{is to consider}} the public/private as a materialization of the shared/reserved (or social/ intimate), instead of taking it as a coincidence of the political/economical. In this sense, the author considers the city as <b>a</b> concrete <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is public, <b>an</b> expression of social order, a will to live together and not an opportunity for an open space to any passer-by (as it may happen in the countryside or in the mountains).

500|$|On January 9, 1779, while {{en route}} to Philadelphia, Hogun was {{promoted}} to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. [...] His promotion came about in part as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Thomas Burke, a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and a fellow Irishman, termed the [...] "distinguished intrepidity" [...] Hogun had exhibited at Germantown. [...] This caused some controversy, as the North Carolina General Assembly, which was customarily consulted {{for the promotion of}} generals from that state, had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. Sumner was promoted, but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun, who received the support of nine of the thirteen states. [...] Hogun's surprising victory was due in large part Burke's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress. [...] By political conventions governing such matters, Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature's recommendations of Clark and Sumner, but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark. [...] Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19, 1779, serving until November 22 that year.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, it is {{revealed}} that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon {{instead of his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net, while Avery wore a black cocktail dress. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce. Since beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic {{relationship between the two}} characters. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. [...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together." [...] Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook-up, he responded [...] "I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work." ...|$|E

So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E
40|$|Capital {{offenders}} {{cannot be}} executed {{if they are}} mentally retarded. Therefore, the IQ scores of offenders are important, and the U.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} 1 Cor 14 : 34 – 35, on {{the background}} of the social world of Paul within the context of first Corinthians and, more broadly, the entire Bible, in order to find out to what the instruction in these verses to women to keep silence precisely refers. Given that in various churches the issue of granting equal roles and positions to women as to men is still problematic, {{the findings of this study}} will make a contribution to the biblical scholarship in understanding the matter. Furthermore, the results will help the church, especially the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania – Mbulu Diocese which still use the Scripture to deny women from being ordained as pastors. Thus, the study will show whether the denial of ordination and other leadership roles for women is truly scriptural or whether it is rooted in patriarchal cultures and is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> misinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Paul wrote. Other challenges that women face because of misinterpreting the Scripture are also addressed...|$|R
