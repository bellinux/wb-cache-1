40|$|Extension {{practitioners}} {{from the}} private sector are highly trained in the Natural Science. Some shortfalls in their Extension Science training have been identified. Perceived training needs in the Extension Science within this sector have been privatised. A number of possible training inputs and options are suggested. Options can be pursued by way of the Continuous Professional Development (CPD) models as already practiced by a number of Professions. Such investment can assist management with personnel evaluation. Credible and experienced seminar style (including capable retirees) would become involved in CPD programmes and as mentors within in-service training initiatives. The private sector is becoming increasingly involved in the upliftment of the emerging agricultural sector. Many emerging farmers are seen as the Commercial Gardens of the future and are being empowered by their Extensionists to fulfil such roles. The quality of the training cannot be compromised. Compromising education and training programmes is disadvantageous to the Extensionist but even more so to the disadvantage of the farming clientele. Only 16. 3 % of the practicing <b>agricultural</b> <b>Extensionist</b> lack sufficient training in the Natural Sciences to register with the South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions (SACNASP). 43, 5 % of the field workers (80) are members of Learned Societies in the Natural Sciences, 12, 5 % are members of the South African Society for Agricultural Extension(SASAE) and only 6, 3 % are registered with SACNASP.

The analysis applied propensity score matching as a means of establishing a counterfactual and differencing to measure impact. Using the Enabling Rural Innovation initiative as a case study, the study establishes that rural livelihood outcomes pertaining to crop and livestock production, household income, asset ownership, and fertilizer use are significantly impacted upon by agricultural innovation systems interventions. In depth analysis however demonstrates that although participating households have more robust livelihoods during the intervention, phasing out of the research 2 program reduces the effects on livelihoods.

The population of this study was all extensionists who were working at various irrigation divisions throughout the Scheme (47 respondents). The main instrument for data collection was a structured questionnaire. The data were collected during the period from January to February 2013. The data were statistically analyzed using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) to calculate frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation. A Likert scale was used to assess the needed level of training [...] The study showed that there was a strong need for in-service and job training to narrow the gap between the actual and the required skills and knowledge. Extensionists expressed a greater need for in-service training in specific areas and they showed the necessity of receiving training on computer skills, extension methods, water management, technical packages of crops, analysis of agricultural policies, optimum use of the available financial resources, determination of farmers training needs, establishment of field demonstrations and field days, evaluation of trails, planning skills of extension programs and integrated pest management.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for West African Sahel farmers to be availed with appropriate technologies and management practices that sustainably increase productivity and resilience, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions where possible. In this paper, we analysed prevailing key water and nutrient interaction practices namely stone bund, zaï and half-moon techniques in order to explore how their outcomes could be linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Data were derived from previous publications but were reinterpreted in the angle of technologies’ alignment with the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). We found that the most successful systems are those that provide water, nutrients and a supportive soil structure in a synergistic manner. Indeed, technologies such as zaï, half-moons and stone bunds, combined with an application of organic/inorganic sources of nutrients, are promising climate-smart agricultural practices that could be widely used by smallholder farmers to maintain food production and secure farmers’ livelihoods, while contributing to ecosystem services. However, accompanying incentive measures are needed to empower and capacitate rural farmers to adopt the considered techniques. These are successful examples that can {{form the basis for}} informing farmers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensionists,</b> as well as future agricultural development plans, policies and investments that pursue sustainable food and nutritional security in the West African Sahel...|$|R
40|$|Land {{evaluation}} is {{the prediction of}} land performance over time under specific uses, to guide strategic land use decisions. Modern land evaluation has a 30 year history, yet the results have often been disappointing. Land users and planners {{have been reported to}} ignore land evaluations, perhaps reflecting poor quality, low relevance, or poor communication. To test the success of a large land evaluation exercise undertaken as part of micro-catchment project in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil, we queried <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensionists,</b> considered as the primary land evaluation clients. We used a questionnaire with both structured and open questions, to determine their experiences with, and attitudes to, the current land evaluation method. The soil resource inventory and associated land evaluation had some usefulness, but were not in general used for their intended purpose, namely farm planning. This was mainly because they did not contain crucial information necessary to such planning in the actual context of the farmer taking decisions. The primary deficiencies were identified as: (1) no estimate of environmental degradation risk; (2) no financial analysis; (3) no social analysis of decision-makers' attitudes and preferences; (4) no risk assessment for weather, yields, profits and market; and (5) insufficiently-specific alternative land uses. These deficiencies could have been avoided with a demand-driven approach, evaluating and reporting according to the true needs and opportunities of the decision-makers...|$|R

40|$|Widespread food {{insecurity}} and rapid biodiversity loss {{are two of}} the most serious problems facing the world today. My work in this area focuses on two important questions: how can we address hunger in a world that produces enough food, but where poverty denies so many access to it? And, how can we accomplish this while conserving the environment upon which all organisms depend? In order to examine these questions, I conducted a case study of the connections between food security and conservation {{in the context of a}} large city (Belo Horizonte, 2. 5 million residents) and its local food system, situated in the “mega-biodiverse” Atlantic Rainforest of southeastern Brazil. Belo Horizonte’s government made access to food a right of citizenship in 1993, creating a Secretariat of Supply (SMAB) to guarantee this right. SMAB has overseen dramatic reductions in infant malnutrition and mortality since its creation in 1993. SMAB’s programs also connects it to local, small family farmers, implicating the role local food may play in landscape biodiversity conservation. The objective of this work is to understand how SMAB formed, how it has achieved its present successes, and whether or not its connection with local farmers has generated differences in biodiversity in the agroecological landscape. Using ants as an indicator of biodiversity, my results suggest that SMAB has had a positive influence on the conservation of biodiversity both on the studied farm fields and within adjoining fragments of native rainforest. It appears that SMAB produces these effects by enhancing economic security for the partnering farmers (such security has been previously shown to affect the sustainability of farmer practices), and via the partner farmers’ regular contacts with <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensionists</b> as part of their participation in SMAB. My results may be the first comprehensive evaluation of a political ecological system starting from food policy and tracing its effects through to biodiversity. Only through such an integrated, holistic understanding of the articulation of human food systems and natural habitats can we conserve crucial and irreplaceable biodiversity, and provide human rights like food security in the “Developing World”, or indeed, in any of the world...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The purpose of this research was to examine the extent {{and the manner in which}} contact farmers in the Training and Visit System of agricultural extension in two districts of eastern Paraguay influenced the dissemination of agricultural information among small-scale follower farmers. The study was conducted in October and November of 2000. Survey instruments were translated into Spanish and data were collected by personal interviews, informal conversations, and through participation in farmer meetings. This descriptive study was based on the responses of 35 Contact Farmers (CF) and 42 Follower Farmers (FF). Results showed that demographic characteristics of the two groups did not differ, except for the level of education (CFs' mean = 6. 83, FFs' mean = 5. 16, t value = 3. 07). The forms of communication used by contact farmers and preferred by follower farmers were individual visits and group meetings. Follower farmers preferred contact farmers, friends, and neighbors, and their own experience to information received from <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensionists.</b> Friends, neighbors, and contact farmers were sources of information that follower farmers stated were available on time, understandable, and trustworthy. Key findings for the adoption of five cotton practices were the following: Paraguayan REBA P- 279 was the most recommended, but the Argentine Guazuncho II was most grown; only 9. 5 % reported the use of the fertilizer formulated as 12 - 12 - 17 - 2; cultural methods of weed control were preferred to chemical control; a 5 % increase in plant density from the beginning to the end of the project was seen; and 88 % reported that they did not have enough information to control cotton diseases. The knowledge gained will be useful for extension workers, administrators, program managers, policymakers, funding organizations, and the general public to formulate guidelines and organize work programs for disseminating information more effectively to small cotton farmers. Results and recommendations will be presented to the board and staff members of the Agricultural Extension Directorate and the Ministry of Agriculture in order to develop strategies for effective methods of communication long needed among all involved in the agricultural extension process...|$|R

40|$|Democratic {{decision-making}} {{inclusive of}} all possible stakeholders in defining issues, goals, agendas, and implementation of programs is perhaps the key to promoting sustainable agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa. In The Gambia, as elsewhere in the developing world, farmers singularly have been, for far too long, assigned a nominal role, largely as passive recipients, in the higher order processes of decision-making for national agricultural policies and practices. Yet the creation of responsive innovations that could contribute to {{a reversal of the}} persistent low productivity of agriculture in most of Africa just might be contingent upon farmers having greater influence and voice in the planning and implementation of development interventions. The traditional hierarchical relationship among farmers, central governments, international aid agencies, and <b>agricultural</b> researchers and <b>extensionists</b> should be replaced by a more democratic practice in which stakeholders engage in genuine partnership relationships based on the principles of mutual accountability, respect, trust, and power sharing, and in which individual knowledge and expertise are valued. This dissertation recounts a participatory action research project I initiated in The Gambia to understand and advance democratic partnerships among private and public stakeholders involved in urban agriculture in the Greater Banjul region of The Gambia. As action research, it was conducted in partnership with a community of inquirers consisting of farmers, researchers, extensionist, central government policymakers, and international aid agencies. The approach also blended direct action organizing of farmers to strengthen organizational and entrepreneurial capacities. In this dissertation I make the case that absent this foundational phase, farmers cannot develop the agency required for them to function as genuine partners in agricultural development processes. The inquiry catalyzed the emergence of a culture of farmer-led organizations in the urban agriculture sector of The Gambia. I had multiple roles in this study. The role of chronicler of the research process is the most important to completing this dissertation.

Although, in many instances it has been overused and misused, attaining sustainability in agricultural development is always one of our concerns. This paper aims (1) to clarify and describe the core beliefs and values underlying the two opposing world views of agriculture, i. e., “conventional agricultural paradigm” and “sustainable agricultural paradigm”; (2) to describe an instrument developed to measure the basic beliefs and values assumed to constitute the two competing paradigms; (3) to measure the adherence of extensionists and researchers of the Ministry of Agriculture towards sustainable agriculture; and (4) to compare the adherence to alternative paradigms against conventional agricultural paradigms of Iranian groups with permaculture groups and agricultural chemical dealers of USA. The instrument was used in a nation wide survey. A two-stage random sample was used. In the first stage, 11 provinces were randomly selected and then in each of the selected provinces a simple random sample of extension agents, extension experts and agricultural researchers were selected for the study. The findings indicated that there is no significant difference among agricultural researchers, extension agents and extension experts in their mean endorsement score of sustainable agriculture. Data from a similar study in the USA were used to provide a means of comparison. Two extreme groups were selected, permaculture group with strong sustainable agricultural score and agricultural chemical dealers with lowest mean scores of sustainable agriculture. The mean scores of sustainable agriculture adherence of three Iranian groups were considerably lower than that of the USA permaculture group. However, there was no significant difference between three Iranian groups and USA agricultural chemical dealers which indicates low adherence of Iranian sample to sustainable agriculture.

Before the official opening by Burkina Faso's Minister of Agriculture, there was an opportunity for different groups of participants (scientists, <b>extensionists,</b> <b>agricultural</b> equipment manufacturers and suppliers and representatives of farmer associations) to meet for a day and express their own views on what the outcome of the seminar should be. After several presentations, including an historical resumé of agricultural mechanization projects in Burkina Faso, the work of the seminar was grouped into three themes that had been identified by the study: ? mechanization programmes within the context of liberalization ? the place of mechanization in agricultural development ? the role of professional organizations in the mechanization and evolution of rural society. Participants then visited blacksmiths and other artisans making agricultural equipment and also farmers who used this equipment. Visits were made to 18 businesses within the environs of Ouagadougou and the information gathered (usually following discussions in local languages with translation into French and English) served to identify further themes for the the working groups which formed {{the second part of the}} seminar proceedings: ? the respective roles of the State and private sector in sustainable mechanization ? action and specific programmes as a function of agro-ecological and socio economic conditions ? the perspective from the point of view of private enterprise.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comparative}} analysis of the joint development of the Fon and Adja styles {{of making a living}} as well as the ecological changes between the two adjacent plateaux in South Bénin on which they live. The period of analysis is between ca. 1600 and 1990. The South Béninese plateaux are usually described as a homogeneous category. However, popular opinion also holds that the Fon plateau is ecologically more degraded than the other plateaux, and that the Fon are socially more organised, technologically more advanced, and socio-economically more successful than the Adja. This thesis challenges the popular images about the Fon and Adja, and analyses how and why ecological processes on their plateaux differed between ca. 1600 and 1990. The two plateaux form part of a chain of plateaux in South Bénin and Togo. They have similar soils (Nitisols) with the same bimodal rainfall pattern and precipitation. The Nitisols are regarded as the best tropical soils for arable farming, but their fertility depends strongly on organic matter and clay content. This led in South Bénin, as in many other places, to high population densities on Nitisols. The Fon and Adja plateaux both had about 110 inhabitants per km 2 in 1960 and about 300 inhabitants per km 2 in 1990 respectively (the Fon plateau 20 - 30 % less if the urban population is excluded). In 2002 the population density was 409 inhabitants per km 2 on the Adja plateau and 377 inhabitants per km 2 on the Fon plateau. Today, the Fon form the largest ethnic group, while the Adja are the second largest group in Bénin, accounting for 19. 9 % and 8. 6 % of the total population, respectively. Ethno-linguistically they are closely related and their cultures have much in common. The two plateaux have the same distance to the coastal urban markets and since 1900, have been subject to fairly homogeneous government policies. Researchers and development interventionists alike tend to assume that any ecological, agronomic and socio-economic data from one plateau can be extrapolated to the rest. Popular belief, on the other hand, holds that the Fon and Adja differ. For example, since early colonial times the Adja are regarded as economi­cally and technologically backward, socially disorganised because they lack higher-level family structures and chiefs, and lazy because they till their land only superficially and do not sell much to export companies. The Fon are internationally known for their pre-colonial Danhomε kingdom and their predominance in all spheres of public life in the colonial and post-colonial state. Fon houses and compound walls are often made from cement-bricks, while the Adja live primarily in clay houses, often having no compound wall at all. In addition to this, the Fon are generally believed to have a more coherent family organisation and to be technologically more advanced than the Adja. So much so, that <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensionists</b> recommend the Fon's ridge tillage, their oil palm planting densities, and their commercial palm oil production to all South Béninese farmers and to the Adja in particular, who practise flat minimum tillage, plant more oil palms per hectare, and harvest more palm wine than oil from their trees. For several decades, degradation of the plateau soils has been a serious concern of policymakers and agronomists. Many argue that the high population densities inevitably lead to soil degradation. In other words, they believe that the plateaux have an intrinsic carrying capacity and that ecological change depends in a neo-Malthusian way on demography. Popular knowledge, however, holds that the soils of the Fon plateau are much poorer than those of the Adja plateau. It is also easy to see that their semi-spontaneous vegetation differs. The Fon plateau consists mainly of tiny herbs and grasses (Cyperus esculentus, Digitaria spp., Brachiaria deflexa, Ipomoea involuncrata etc.) and grasses of 2 meter high (Andropogon gayanus), which tend to catch afire in the dry season. The Adja plateau has a greater variety of herbs, trees and shrubs (Albizia   zygia, Antiaris africana, Combretum hispidum, Mallotus oppositifolius, Dialium guineense, Dracaena arborea, Di­chrostachys glomerata, Securinega virosa, Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides etc.), and the principal grass is the medium-sized Imperata cylindrica. Bush fires do not occur on the Adja plateau. This leaves all those who believe in a linear relationship between population density and agro-ecological change, both the (neo) Malthusians like Homer-Dixon (1999) who regard population growth as a threat, and the followers of Boserup (1965) who consider population growth to be an opportunity for agricultural growth, with the mystery of why Fon and Adja plateau soil fertility levels and vegetations differ in spite of similar demographic conditions. They raise various assumptions in order not to abandon their cherished beliefs in population density models. Many think that the Fon plateau is more densely populated than the Adja plateau, but demographic figures reveal {{that this is not the}} case. Others hypothesise that the Adja plateau was more fertile and more forested than the Fon plateau in its 'original' state. My thesis argues that the Fon and Adja plateau ecologies were similar in the past but diverged under the impact of different human management practices. To 'test' the hypothesis that the two plateaux were ecologically dissimilar before their human occupation, I adopt two approaches, namely an oral history approach and a comparison of processes. In Chapter 4, I analyse local myths of origin of villages and local historical narratives about livelihood activities in their socio-political and technological context and compare these with palaeontological evidence from, amongst others, a lake 20 km from the eastern border of the Fon plateau. My compilation of local traditions, stripped of their likely socio-political intentions, portrays the vegetation of both plateaux as a forest-savannah mosaic when they were colonised. According to various myths on their origin, on both plateaux some villages were installed on grassland, others near isolated trees, and others in more forested areas. These local histories therefore do not require us to reject the opinion of ecologists and palaeontologists that all the South Béninese plateaux were covered, since the end of the last wet period, not later than 950 AD, with a savannah-forest mosaic of the type which is still the dominant spontaneous vegetation of the Adja plateau (and the other plateaux in the chain) today, and that only the Fon plateau is degraded. The triangulation of migratory myths from many different sources and localities also indicates that the Fon and Adja plateaux became more densely populated from the 16 th century onwards, the Adja plateau mainly by Adja from Tado who brought their own iron tools, and the Fon plateau by various Adja-related peoples (Wemenu, Za, Ayizo, Jinu, etc.) and a small Yoruba-related group (the Gedevi) that was socio-politically dominant over its Adja-related neighbours. This Yoruba-related group and visiting traders from the north-east introduced iron tools from the Yoruba and the Bariba to the Fon plateau, especially hoes which were suitable for ridging. The Adja hoes from Tado however, were only suitable for flat cultivation and for mounding. When more iron became available in the 16 th century through the arrival of European traders on the coast, the Yoruba hoe and ridge tillage rapidly spread on the Fon plateau, while the Adja plateau was increasingly colonised by flat-cultivators using Adja hoes. Therefore, the different orientation of the Fon and Adja's socio-political and tool trade networks — their different socio-technical networks, encouraged the development of different tillage styles not later than the 16 th century. The ecological impact of these tillage styles is discussed in Chapter 9 (see below).   Around 1610 another Adja-related group arrived on the Fon plateau, the Agasuvi, who became accepted by the resident population as their royal family. In Chapter 5 I show that the Fon, under their leadership, formed a kingdom called Danhomε, whose strength resided in the centralisation of weapon production and of military power around a few smithies, the centralisation of religion around a number of State cults, and in the promotion of a warrior ideology. From the latter part of the 17 th until the late 19 th century, the Fon raided neighbouring groups, selling many of them to transatlantic slave traders, and retaining others for their own domestic and agricultural work. Trade in other local and imported commodities also flourished in Danhomε at that time, and every adult - including the more fortunate slaves - could participate in it. Contrary to what Polanyi (1968) wrote about Danhomε to support his substantivist theory, the king did not control trade except for that relating to the court's standing army. My findings also do not support attempts in the literature to characterise Danhomε's economy with a single label. And neither does Elwert's (1977) 'slave raiding mode of production articulated to a subsistence mode of production', nor Coquery-Vidrovitch's (1971) 'tributary feudal system', nor Manning's (1982) 'commodity exchange mode of production joined by a slave labor mode of production' describe it sufficiently. What I do show is that the elites' urbanised styles of making a living, including trade, warfare, forging, religious activities as well as weaving and wearing of prestigious cloth, rose in status in the Fon kingdom, while rural life and agriculture became stigmatised. Nukanmε, literally 'secondary bush', became a Fon synonym for backwardness and was a derogatory label for the countryside, in general. Inhabitants of rural areas who neither traded nor engaged in 'urban' crafts were called nukanmεnu or 'backward people of the bush'. At the same time, for the Adja, bush and countryside were central to their|$|R
