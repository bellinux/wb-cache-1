40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} Th-rich hellandite-(Ce) and britholite-(Ce) within a volcanic ejectum from a pyroclastic formation of the Vice volcanic complex, north of Rome, Italy. The host rock is a saturated <b>alkali-syenite</b> which consists mainly of potassium feldspar and plagioclase, together with fluor-biotite, plagioclase, titanite, clinopyroxene and magnetite. Hellandite-(Ce) and britholite-(Ce) are associated with this mineral assemblage which contains also several accessory phases including zircon, fluorapatite, allanite, and silico-phosphates of Th, U, REE close in composition to cheralite-brabantite. Hellandite-(Ce) and britholite-(Ce) are typically intergrown with hellandite in all case observed rimming britholite. These unusual REE, Th, U minerals are secondary {{to the formation of}} the host rock and the compositions of the associated minerals suggest that they originated from fluids rich in F, P and possibly S and C. The presence of fractures filled by clays containing dispersed REE-minerals, probably fluorocarbonates, suggests a very late-stage hydrothermal remobilization, transportation and redeposition of the REE. An important implication of such widespread secondary mineralization is that great care should be exerted when using bulk-rock trace-element data from these volcanic samples for geochemical modelling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new {{occurrence of the}} rare minerals perrierite-(Ce) and zirconolite in the tephra of the Roccamonfina volcano. The host rock is a foid-bearing <b>alkali-syenite</b> and is composed predominantly of sanidine with minor clinopyroxene, magnetite and sodalite. Accessory phases include titanite, zircon and baddeleyite. Intense phyllic and argillic alteration is observed at alkali-feldspars grain boundaries or along fractures within crystals. Perrierite-(Ce) occurs as brownish-red, transparent, well-developed, euhedral, prismatic crystals inside the miarolitic cavities of the ejectum. Its powder pattern can be indexed in the monoclinic P 2 (1) /m space group, with (in Angstrom) a = 13. 676 (11), b = 5. 655 (2), c = 11. 763 (8), beta = 113. 75 (4). It is Zr-rich and the entry of Zr in the C site of the structure can be described by the charge balancing substitution: Ca-[A]([C]) (Ti 4 +,Zr 4 +) = (REE 3 +[C]) -R-[A](M- 3 +,M 2 +). Zirconolite occurs as very small acicular or stubby prismatic crystals typically associated with baddeleyite in the altered parts of the rock. In the ternary REE-Act-Me 5 + its composition plots well {{within the field of}} zirconolites from alkali syenitic environments. The genesis of this unusual mineral assemblage is related to late metasomatic stages at hypabyssal conditions of the regional volcanic activity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a combined electron microprobe and analytical TEM study that describes the chemical and structural characteristics of non-metamict zirconolite from a volcanic ejectum collected within a pyroclastic formation of the Vico volcanic complex, near Tre Croci Community, Latium (Italy). The host rock is a foid-bearing <b>alkali-syenite</b> and consists of potassium-feldspar and plagioclase, with minor biotite, titanite, clinopyroxene and magnetite. Sodalite occurs as well-faceted crystals inside miarolitic cavities between intersecting feldspars and it is variably altered to a kaolinite-like product. Accessory minerals include zircon, baddeleyite, stillwellite, hellandite, fluorite, apatite and monazite. Zirconolite occurs both as elongated acicular crystals of orthorhombic symmetry (zirconolite- 3 O), space group Acam, with (in Å) a = 10. 13 (1), b = 14. 16 (1) and c = 7. 288 (2), and as pseudo-hexagonal platy crystals of trigonal symmetry (zirconolite- 3 T), space group P 312, with a = 7. 279 (2) and c = 16. 89 (2). TEM studies revealed additionally the presence of polytype zirconolite- 2 M in a subset of grains analyzed. Zirconolite displays pronounced compositional zoning, observed in backscattered electron images, resulting mainly from an antipathetic variation in the actinide elements (Th + U) and REE contents. Analytical TEM results indicate compositional differences exist between the zirconolite- 3 T and zirconolite- 2 M polytypes. Zirconolite, and associated accessory REE, Th, U minerals crystallized after the formation of the major rock-forming minerals of the ejectum, from metasomatic fluids rich in F and P...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} a study of over 900 square miles of country round {{the southern end of}} Lake Malawi, the geology of which was previously unknown. The complex structure of the Basement series of crystalline rocks which are exposed on either flank of the Rift results from two episodes of deformation producing superimposed sets of folds with NNW-SSE and NE-SW trending axial planes. These rocks, which are probably largely of sedimentary origin, show a common imprint of granulite facies metamorphism, but the widespread occurrence of disequilibrium textures and biotite in them shows them to have suffered retrogressive changes. The retrograde changes are associated with a growth of microperthitic felspar, extreme development of which gives rise to palingenetic perthositic syenites and quartz-syenites. These syenites are broadly syntectonic with the second deformation; an alkali metasomatism leading to syenitisation, reactivation and partial mobilisation of a pre-existing crystalline Basement is thus indicated. The repeatedly folded polymetamorphic Basement rocks have been intruded, apparently under epeirogenic conditions, by later series of microcline-granites and <b>alkali-syenites.</b> Recent work on radiometric dating has shown that episodes of intrusion of microcline-granites occurred in the region of the Malawi Rift in the Lower Silurian and the Middle Permian, and of <b>alkali-syenites</b> in the Lower Cretaceous, and correlation of the Fort Johnston intrusions with these events is suggested. An account of the minor intrusions of the area is also included. The marked structural asymmetry of this part of the Rift is demonstrated, and the Rift faulting and its relation with the pre-existing structures is examined and discussed. A description of the physiography of the area is given which includes the south-eastern extremity of the Lake, its basin, its shorelines, and its only outlet, which lies within the area mapped...|$|R
40|$|UNUSUALLY large {{crystals}} of boehmite {{have been}} found associated with analcime in syenite from the Mandamus igneous complex in New Zealand, and are probably a replacement product of feldspar. The crystals are sufficiently large to allow measurement of 2 V with the universal stage; a second cleavage {ioo} reported by de Lapparent (I 93 O), but not since ob-served, is well developed. The identification of boehmite is confirmed by X-ray data, and the mineral has been analysed using an electron microprobe. The Mandamus igneous complex is Cretaceous in age and comprises a variety of <b>alkali-syenites,</b> diorites, and gabbros with associated trachyte and igneous breccias. It intrudes complexly folded Torlesse supergroup sediments of probable Triassic age, and is overlain (on an erosional surface) by a sequence of uppermost Cretaceous-Tertiary sediments. The general petrology of the complex {{has been described by}} Mason (I 95 I) and Reid (1972). The boehmite-bearing syenite occurs 15 o m from a volcanic vent and to the south-west of Hurunui Peak (NZMS I: Sheet S 6 I, Culverden, grid ref. 971474, 2 o km west of Culverden and 8 o km north of Christchurch). The syenite is made of interlocking subhedral crystals up to 5 mm length of perthitic alkali-feldspar (approx. 8 o o. ~>), prismatic crystals of complexly zone...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Cretaceous Ambohiby Complex is an {{alkaline}} ring complex {{located in}} {{the central part of}} Madagascar and covers a mountainous area of approximately 225 km 2. The complex intrudes into Precambrian basement gneisses and consists of the following rock types in a chronological order; gabbros, monzonite, <b>alkali-syenite,</b> micro-granite and granites. Both mafic and felsic rocks are dominated by sodic mineralogies. Pyroxenes are generally aegirine, aegirine-augite, and hedenbergite and commonly occur in granites, micro-granites, syenites and monzonite. In gabbros and mafic dykes, augite is the more common composition. Amphiboles are represented by bluish to brownish-green varieties with arfvedsonite to eckermannite compositions in granites, and magnesia-arfvedsonite compositions in micro-granites. Ferro-edenite is present in some alkali-syenites and monzonite. Feldspars are usually single phase and are therefore hypersolvus. In granites, micro-granites and alkali-syenites, path and string perthite is very common. Graphic intergrowth of quartz and alkali feldspars is also common in granites and some alkalisyenites. Major elements variation diagrams plotted against SiO 2 indicate that the mafic and felsic rocks of the Ambohiby Complex were formed by processes similar to those of Fractional crystallization. Chondrite normalised mafic rocks have slightly positive Eu anomalies while the felsic rocks have negative Eu anomalies, indicating fractionation of plagioclase feldspars. The Chondrite normalised gabbroic rocks shared similar trends of heavy rare earth with Chondrite normalised Marion Hotspot data. This suggests that the basaltic parent magma for the Ambohiby Complex, possibly related to the Marion hotspot plume. The Fractional crystallization model with an inclusion of olivine in the mineral assemblage seems to fit very well with the actual Ambohiby felsic end member rocks (i. e. granites). It is therefore clear that differentiation mainly occurred by fractional crystallization but variable initial Sr and Nd values indicate the magmas assimilated crustal material during emplacement. The Rb-Sr geochronology gave an age of 90 ± 2. 4 Ma for the intrusion of the Ambohiby Complex, which confirms that the Ambohiby Complex is associated with the Gondwana break-up. In addition the Marion Hotspot plume {{is believed to have been}} {{located in the}} southern tip of the island at around 90 Ma ago...|$|E
