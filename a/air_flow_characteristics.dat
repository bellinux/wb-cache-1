For effective treatment {{it is very important}} to understand <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> within respiratory airways and determine deposition hot spots. In this paper the air flow in trachea was investigated by numerical simulations. To validate these results we carried out particle image velocimetry experiments and compared resulting velocity fields. Simplified geometry of respiratory airways from oral cavity to 4 th generation of branching was employed. <b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> were analysed during sinusoidal breathing pattern for light activity conditions (period 4 s and tidal volume 1 l). The observed flow fields indicated that the flow in trachea is turbulent during the sinusoidal flow except phases of flow turnarounds. The flow was skewed to front side of the trachea during inspiration and had twin-peak profile during expiration because of the mixing from daughter branches. The methods were compared and good agreement was found. This validation of CFD simulation can result into its further usage in respiratory airflow studies...|$|E

A double swirl flow pulverized-coal burner has two ring recirculation zones that start in the secondary air region of the burner. With increasing secondary <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> axial velocity increases, the maximum values for the radial velocity, tangential velocity, and turbulence intensity all increase, and there are slight increases in the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> swirl intensity and the recirculation zone size.

Pulverized-coal ignites farther into the burner, in the secondary air region. Gas temperature, O 2 concentration, NOx concentration, char burnout and component release rates of C, H, and N all increase. Furthermore, CO concentration varies slightly and pulverized-coal ignites closer.

A CFD calculation has been used to model the air movements inside the chamber and derive the relevant location for the pressure sensors.

A flow coefficient and a flow exponent of a power law equation have been identified for different window opening angles. Flow rates have been evaluated in “Maison Air et lumière” using an air flow model (CONTAM) with the characteristics evaluated previously. These results were compared with on site tracer gas measurements. Indoor air temperatures in the house have been evaluated using dynamic thermal simulation complemented with air flow calculation (PLEIADES+COMFIE) in order to evaluate the potential of ventilative cooling. Around 5 K indoor temperature reduction has been obtained by the use of ventilative cooling, both by simulation and measurement: with similar outdoor conditions, the interior air temperature of the house was 5 K lower using ventilative cooling than without any opening of windows. The air exchange rates were between 10 and 22 air change per hour even with limited wind velocities (between 2 and 3 m/s) and low temperature difference between outside and inside (0 - 3 K).

The aspect ratio of the model test section is 10. The average velocity vectors, streamlines, and vorticity distributions are measured and analyzed by the Flow Manager in a particle image velocimetry(PIV) system. The PIV technology gives three different velocity distributions according to observational points of view for understanding the polluted <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The maximum value of mean velocity generally occurs in the inlet and outlet vent regions in the tunnel models...|$|E
40|$|Palm Oil Fuel Ash (POFA) is a {{pozzolanic}} {{material that}} has great potential in concrete production. POFA sizes range from 1 to 10 μm is preferable. Thus, {{there is a}} need for efficient method to separate the POFA according to the sizes needed. This study explores the idea of using a simple wind tunnel as a separator for ultrafine POFA. The existing operation of the wind tunnel is simulated using ANSYS-CFX, a numerical modelling software. The identified weakness of the wind tunnel design is located at the hopper. The wind tunnel is simulated with a different air inlet velocity in order to visualize the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> profile as well as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> energy at the hopper. Different air inlet velocities has a similar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> profile but the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> intensity is different. For further study the modifications of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> profile were conducted. By altering the hopper angle shows that the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> profile is changed. Based on the simulation results, the hopper at 60 ° yields the best <b>flow</b> <b>characteristic.</b> At angle 60 ° of the hopper, the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is mostly directed downward into the tunnel and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> energy is low. Therefore, it allows the POFA to be directed into the tunnel and reduced the ultrafine POFA losses at the tip of the hopper. This practical method utilizes a simple open wind tunnel that enables the process to be more efficient and cost efficient thus the production of ultrafine POFA can be increased...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to understand {{the effect of the}} MQL parameters; namely, oil <b>flow</b> rate, <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and nozzle distance from the cutting zone, on the <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> in order to optimise the cooling and lubrication capacities of the jet for machining applications. Flow visualisation experiments were performed for different <b>air</b> and oil <b>flow</b> rates and distances from the nozzle using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA). The visualisation results, such as, the droplet size and velocity vector were used to identify the optimum MQL conditions to achieve the desired <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> for machining applications. It was found that a spray with high <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and high oil flow rate would give an axial, symmetrical, coherent, and undisturbed spray, which is characterised by small droplet size and high velocity. This spray is optimum for machining due to its ability for better penetration and cooling effect in the cutting zone. Milling tests were performed on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy to validate the effect of MQL parameters on the machining performance, in terms of cutting forces, surface roughness and tool temperature.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> is {{employed}} in many textile processes to transport or to excite yarns {{to move in}} specific directions. <b>Air</b> <b>flows</b> cannot be controlled completely, which leads to some deviations or unexpected behaviour of the guided objects like a yarn. In this research, the interaction between a yarn and the surrounding <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is studied in two applications: yarn splicing and yarn weaving. Both applications involve compressible flow and {{it is found that}} the compressibility effects on the turbulence have to be taken into account. In the first application, yarn splicing is studied based on <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> simulations. The CFD results are linked to experiments and the best <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> are determined. The second application focuses on the main nozzle, which {{is an essential part of}} an air jet weaving machine. The geometry of the main nozzle is optimized to give the highest axial aerodynamic force, thus the highest weft yarn speed. The motion of a weft yarn inside a main nozzle is modelled by coupling a 2 D axisymmetric fluid model and 3 D structure one. The effects of the yarn motion on the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> are added by a source term to avoid the problems of employing a dynamic mesh which is proven to be complex with a flexible object like a yarn...|$|R
