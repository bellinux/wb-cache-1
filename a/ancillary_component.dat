40|$|The most {{promising}} concept for a regenerative CO 2 removal system for long duration manned space flight is the Electrochemical CO 2 Concentrator (EDC), {{which allows for}} the continuous, efficient removal of CO 2 from the spacecraft cabin. This study addresses the advancement of the EDC system by generating subsystem and <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> reliability data through extensive endurance testing and developing related hardware components such as electrochemical module lightweight end plates, electrochemical module improved isolation valves, an improved air/liquid heat exchanger and a triple redundant relative humidity sensor. Efforts included fabrication and testing the EDC with a Sabatier CO 2 Reduction Reactor and generation of data necessary for integration of the EDC into a space station air revitalization system. The results verified {{the high level of}} performance, reliability and durability of the EDC subsystem and ancillary hardware, verified the high efficiency of the Sabatier CO 2 Reduction Reactor, and increased the overall EDC technology engineering data base. The study concluded that the EDC system is approaching the hardware maturity levels required for space station deployment...|$|E

40|$|The AAA-ATPase (ATPase {{associated}} with various cellular activities) p 97 has {{been implicated in}} the degradation of misfolded and unassembled proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ERAD). To better understand its role in this process, we used a reconstituted cell-free system to define the precise contribution of p 97 in degrading immature forms of the polytopic, multi-domain protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Although p 97 augmented both the rate {{and the extent of}} CFTR degradation, it was not obligatorily required for ERAD. Only a 50 % decrease in degradation was observed in the complete absence of p 97. Moreover, p 97 specifically stimulated the degradation of CFTR transmembrane (TM) domains but had no effect on isolated cytosolic domains. Consistent with this, p 97 -mediated extraction of intact TM domains was independent of proteolytic cleavage and influenced by TM segment hydrophobicity, indicating that the relative contribution of p 97 is partially determined by substrate stability. Thus, we propose that p 97 functions in ERAD as a nonessential but important <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> to the proteasome where it facilitates substrate presentation and increases the degradation rate and efficiency of stable (TM) domains...|$|E
40|$|Agonists of the {{dopamine}} D 1 /D 5 receptors {{that are}} positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase specifically induce a slowly developing long-lasting potentiation {{of the field}} excitatory postsynaptic potential in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus that lasts for > 6 hr. This potentiation is blocked by the specific D 1 /D 5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and is occluded by the potentiation induced by cAMP agonists. An agonist of the D 2 receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through G alpha i, did not induce potentiation. Although this slow D 1 /D 5 agonist-induced potentiation is partially independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, it seems to share some steps with and is occluded by the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) produced by three repeated trains of nerve stimuli applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Similarly, the D 1 /D 5 antagonist SCH 23390 attenuates the late phase of the LTP induced by repeated trains, and the D 1 /D 5 agonist-induced potentiation is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. These {{results suggest that the}} D 1 /D 5 receptor may be involved in the late, protein synthesis-dependent component of LTP in the hippocampal CA 1 region, either as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> or as a mediator directly contributing to the late phase...|$|E
40|$|The Fuel Cell {{has been}} used for manned space flight since the Gemini program. Its power output and water {{production}} capability over long durations for the mass and volume are critical for manned space-flight requirements. The alkaline fuel cell used on the Shuttle, while very reliable and capable for it s application, has operational sensitivities, limited life, and an expensive recycle cost. The PEM fuel cell offers many potential improvements in those areas. NASA Glenn Research Center is currently leading a PEM fuel cell development and test program intended to move the technology closer to the point required for manned space-flight consideration. This paper will address the advantages of PEM fuel cell technology and its potential for future space flight as compared to existing alkaline fuel cells. It will also cover the technical hurdles that must be overcome. In addition, a description of the NASA PEM fuel cell development program will be presented, and the current status of this effort discussed. The effort is a combination of stack and <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> hardware development, culminating in breadboard and engineering model unit assembly and test.

50|$|In general, {{much care}} and {{attention}} to detail must be exercised in the experimental setup of SRF cavities {{so that there is}} not Qo degradation due to RF losses in <b>ancillary</b> <b>components,</b> such as stainless steel vacuum flanges that are too close to the cavity's evanescent fields. However, careful SRF cavity preparation and experimental configuration have achieved the ideal Qo not only for low field amplitudes, but up to cavity fields that are typically 75% of the magnetic field quench limit. Few cavities make it to the magnetic field quench limit since residual losses and vanishingly small defects heat up localized spots, which eventually exceed the superconducting critical temperature and lead to a thermal quench.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Historically, space {{mechanism}} lubricant {{choices were}} based on space heritage {{rather than on the}} latest technology or best available materials. With the limited mission lives and minimal duty cycles of the early space programme, this strategy was highly successful. As missions extended, other spacecraft components, such as electronics, batteries, and computers, failed before lubricated mechanisms; however, during the 1980 s and 1990 s, these <b>ancillary</b> <b>components</b> vastly improved and tribological systems became a main factor limiting spacecraft reliability and performance. Although tribological components represent {{only a small fraction of}} the spacecraft’s cost, they are often single-point failures that cripple or debilitate expensive spacecraft.

50|$|On initial completion, {{the first}} {{locomotives}} {{were found to}} weigh 3 LT over the specification weight of 72 LT. A programme of lightening was begun: some of this involved cutting circular lightening holes into the bogie frames, and replacing steel buffer beams or roof panels with aluminium. Much of the over-weight was due to <b>ancillary</b> <b>components,</b> particularly the train-heating steam generators, being supplied over weight. To avoid waste, these components were replaced by lighter versions from other makers, but the heavier originals were then used in the Class 20 and Class 40 locomotives. The lightened locomotives eventually met British Rail's approval, but only after a painstaking weighing that involved specifying the amount of sand in the sandboxes and other precise details.|$|R
25|$|Building on Aston Martin's {{established}} {{road car}} and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional spaceframe structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. Beneath the skin the DBR4's basic design was {{closely related to}} the DB3S sports car of 1956, but with its <b>ancillary</b> <b>components</b> more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use wind-tunnel testing for racing cars, such as the Bristol 450, aerodynamics as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake {{on the side of the}} bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.|$|R
