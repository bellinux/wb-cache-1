He is credited with popularizing the bhakti Shakta tradition and Shyama Sangeet—devotional songs to the goddess Kali. Ramprasad was the first Shakta poet to address Kali with such intimate devotion, and to sing of her as a tender loving mother or even <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> After him, a school of Shakta poets continued the Kali-bhakti tradition.|$|E

When alone, Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> when she was kidnapped. Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline.

Röhl also notes further symptoms described in letters between Charlotte and her physician Ernst Schweninger, who treated her for over two decades {{beginning in the early}} 1890s; in them, Charlotte variously complains of [...] "toothache, backache, insomnia, dizzy spells, nausea, constipation, excruciating 'wandering' abdominal pains, skin oedema and itching, partial paralysis of the legs and dark red or orange urine", the last of which Röhl calls the [...] "decisive diagnostic symptom".|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish {{a little girl in}} the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was my message in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance." [...] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolises [...] "innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing.

500|$|In Saint-Briac, {{during the}} summer, Kirill played golf {{and he and}} Victoria joined in picnics and excursions. [...] They {{were part of the}} social life of the community, going out to play bridge and {{organizing}} theatricals. [...] During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games. [...] However, it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris [...] "for the occasional fling". Victoria, who had devoted her life to Kirill, was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her, according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania. She kept up a façade for the sake of her children, including her teenage son Vladimir, but was unable to forgive Kirill's betrayal. Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild, Mechtilde of Leiningen, in February 1936. Family and friends arrived, but nothing could be done. When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come, to which Victoria haltingly replied, [...] "It makes all the difference." [...] However, she [...] "shuddered away from Kirill's touch," [...] wrote Marie. She died on 1 March 1936.

500|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie.

500|$|... "Her chief characteristics… were {{a strong}} will and a {{singularly}} straightforward habit {{of thought and}} action", wrote her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova, who recalled Olga's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. [...] "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." [...] Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, {{her relationship with her}} mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. [...] "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13, 1916. [...] "And when I am severe — sulks me." [...] In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother's invalidism. [...] "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. [...] "It's all so unpleasant." [...] Queen Marie of Romania, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared [...] "they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires." ...|$|E
