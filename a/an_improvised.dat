5|$|On October 4, 1957, {{the very}} {{evening of the}} launch of Sputnik, {{students}} and faculty met at the Observatory and constructed <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> radio interferometer. They published the first precise ephemeris in Nature in November. Their success helped gather momentum and funding for the radio astronomy program.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00am on 1 August, a Georgian police lorry {{was blown}} up by <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> {{explosive}} device {{on the road}} near Tskhinvali, injuring five Georgian policemen. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian border checkpoints, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven. According to majority of reports, South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.|$|E

5|$|Taliban forces took up new {{positions}} {{to defend the}} town on 9 December. Taliban sources suggested {{at the time that}} militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs planted by insurgents continued to take a toll on ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was killed by the detonation of <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> explosive device.|$|E
5|$|The outer rainbands of Alex caused three {{deaths in}} Acapulco, Guerrero, after a {{retaining}} wall collapsed over {{the occupants of}} <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> shack in a vacant lot. The investigation that followed found that the wall had been built without structural enforcements, and that the torrential rainfall had weakened the wall's foundation.|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Muslim {{army was}} met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps. Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents and armed with tent poles charged at their husbands and fellow men singing <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> song from the Battle of Uhud that then had been directed against the Muslims.|$|E

5|$|During the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos {{was part}} of a {{tactical}} group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of Split. On 14 November 1991, Croatian Navy commandos disabled the vessel with <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by her crew. The crippled ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of Šolta. She was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as Šolta. As of 2014, Šolta remains in service with the Croatian Coast Guard, {{an integral part of the}} navy.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that long-time supporting cast members Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick would spin their characters off into their own stage adaptation, titled An Arresting Night. Kitson and Emerick, who appeared together on Last of the Summer Wine as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh from 2003 to 2010, reprised their roles in <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> stage play. While some elements of the series will be used, the majority of the play was improvised, with Kitson and Emerick each deriving their cues of what to do from the audience. The play was successfully performed in Holmfirth, after which dates were announced in Emerick's hometown on the Wirral Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Barré, accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung out in <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> line of battle. Barré hoped to make use of a heavy sea fog that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
5000|$|Performing {{like this}} was a {{challenge}} for them and made the resulting music unpredictable, but as <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> duo, this pleased them. It {{gave rise to a}} rhythmic tension not present in a group with just one drummer. Frith told Down Beat magazine in 1982: ...|$|R

On occasion, in solo and ensemble projects, he performs as <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> sound artist.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} 2nd Vision were sown in 1977 when Sanders invited {{keyboard}} player Dave Bristow and drummer Mickey Barker, {{both of whom}} he'd already played with in his Birmingham days, to form <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> unit named Surrounding Silence, which debuted at the Riverside Jazz Festival in August 1977.|$|R
5|$|The CIA's base at Camp Chapman {{was set up}} at the {{beginning}} of the U.S.-led offensive against al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban in 2001. It began as <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> center for operations. A military base at {{the beginning}}, it was later transformed into a CIA base. Camp Chapman was also used as a base for the Khost Provincial Reconstruction Team, a military-led development group. In recent years, the base evolved into a major counter-terrorism hub of the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division, used for joint operation with U.S. special operations forces and Afghan allies. It also had a housing compound for U.S. intelligence officers.|$|E
5|$|The cruiser then {{returned}} to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. <b>An</b> <b>improvised</b> minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5000|$|Machine Gun is <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> band {{formed in}} New York City in 1986. Its members were: Robert Musso: guitars, Thomas Chapin: reeds and flute, John Lunar Richey: vocals, cut-ups, tapes, TV, Bil Bryant: drums, Jair-Rohm Parker Wells: basses. Karl Berger is {{featured}} on melodica on their eponymous first release.|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} Mark Corroto notes that [...] "While this session is billed as <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> occasion, the duo is {{anything}} but loose and no musical idea finds a dead end. It seems that for every action one player takes, there is the positive reaction by the other." ...|$|R
50|$|Twisted Flicks a B-movie {{which is}} {{played with the}} sound turned off. Improvisers with {{microphones}} create the dialogue and sound effects based on suggestions from the audience. Twisted Flicks features <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> musician, who writes and performs a parody song {{to kick off the}} movie, then underscores the remainder of the film.|$|R
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist {{knows exactly what}} he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> camera dolly.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
50|$|The player {{character}} assumes {{control of}} <b>a</b> <b>improvised</b> combat vehicle and performs {{a variety of}} missions to progress through the game's storyline, and has an option for free-roam {{and is able to}} commit certain actions to increase their criminal ranks, such as attacking rival gangs, destroying enemy vehicles or creating havoc in the city.|$|R
5000|$|Third Person was <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> trio {{formed in}} 1990 in New York City, led by cellist Tom Cora and drummer Samm Bennett. Each {{performance}} featured an invited guest: A third person. Guests included guitarist Marc Ribot, harpist Zeena Parkins, clarinet player Don Byron and saxophone players George Cartwright and Kazutoki Umezu and many others.|$|R
50|$|Other {{occasional}} {{projects were}} Soft Bounds (with French musicians Sophia Domancich and Simon Goubert, first with Elton Dean and then Simon Picard), which like PolySoft released a live CD recorded at the Triton club, and Clear Frame, <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> group with Charles Hayward, Lol Coxhill and Orphy Robinson (augmented {{for their first}} release by Robert Wyatt on cornet).|$|R
5|$|During the inter-war years, the {{government}} {{concluded that the}} fort was no longer militarily useful and there were unsuccessful attempts to sell it off for development. During the Second World War, the fort initially housed <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> anti-aircraft operations room, controlling the defences of the Thames and Medway (North) Gun Zone between 1939 and 1940. Trenches were dug across the surrounding area to prevent an airborne attack. The enlisted barracks and the facilities block, as well as probably the sutler's house, were bombed and damaged, being demolished after the war. The fort was transferred out of military use relatively early in the post-war period, and in 1950 the Ministry of Works took over the site. Restoration work {{took place in the}} 1970, including the construction of replica wooden bridges. It was opened to the public in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in <b>an</b> <b>improvised</b> theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
50|$|Rochford {{has played}} drums for Polar Bear, Acoustic Ladyland, Basquiat Strings, Oriole, Menlo Park, Ingrid Laubrock Quintet, Bojan Zulfikarpasic's Tetraband, and Sons of Kemet.

5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars stating [...] "Hands On reveals Paul Bley as an {{archetype}} -- <b>an</b> <b>improvising</b> jazz pianist who serves the larger model {{of an artist}} who meditates upon his work actively, restlessly, and relentlessly, seeking its core, until that work exhausts itself and gives way to become, finally, a work of art, original and unrepeatable".|$|R
