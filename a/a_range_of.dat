50|$|A bat’s {{hearing is}} {{especially}} sensitive to sounds that have similar frequencies {{to its own}} echolocation pulses.

Stated differently, CF bats produce narrow bandwidth sounds, or sounds over <b>a</b> restricted <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies. Contrastingly, FM bats produce broad bandwidth pulses, which contain <b>a</b> wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies. It follows that CF bats have auditory systems that are highly sensitive to <b>a</b> limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies, while the auditory systems of FM bats are sensitive to <b>a</b> vast <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies.|$|R
