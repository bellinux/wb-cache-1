The companies boarded the train which quickly got underway for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured.|$|E
5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the Iraqi military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mountains}} in southwestern Wyoming, Wilkins Peak {{is part of}} the Green River Formation, <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of the intermontane Lake Gosiute environment during the Eocene epoch. Similar to its neighboring Aspen Mountain, Wilkins Peak {{is part of the}} Rock Springs Uplift, and some of the largest oil shale and trona beds in the region are located near the mountain. Wilkins Peak also has its own distinct segment of the Green River Formation, which is known as the Wilkins Peak Formation.|$|E

5|$|Baker {{proceeded}} {{overseas to}} France on 15 June 1918 and, on arrival the following day, was posted to No.4 Squadron AFC piloting Sopwith Camels. On 23 June, he flew his first operational sortie over the German lines; {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant four days later. On 31 July, Baker was among <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of seven Camels tasked with carrying out a patrol over German-held territory. The group crossed over into German lines near Nieppe Forrest, and flew towards Estaires. The Camels soon intercepted <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of seven Fokker D.VIIs, and the entire patrol immediately dived at the German aircraft. In the ensuing melee, Baker managed to force one of the aircraft down to the ground, thus scoring his first aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|From 1941, forward, the Leibstandarte became four {{distinct}} entities, the Waffen-SS division (unconnected to Hitler's {{personal protection}} but <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of the Waffen-SS), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment {{assigned to the}} Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his personal apartment and the Brown House NSDAP headquarters in Munich. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} there was a high {{interest}} in air cadets, additional squadrons were established with different parade nights to accommodate the numbers. These squadrons were often placed into air cadet wings (<b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of two or more squadrons) with a separate wing HQ staff of both officers and senior cadets overseeing the operation. The system was discontinued in the late 1960s and all squadrons became independent once again.|$|E
5|$|In response, the Seventh Air Force {{launched}} repeated {{strikes on}} the Yen Vien rail yard and other infrastructures which linked Hanoi with the China buffer zone. On 21 August 1967, <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of twenty F-105 Thunderchiefs and eight F-4 Phantoms raided Yen Vien, which contained about 150 boxcars. The Americans {{claimed to have}} damaged {{more than half of}} the boxcars and trapped the remainder in the rail yard, so they returned two days later to destroy the rest. On the afternoon of 23 August 1967, a flight of sixteen F-4s from the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing escorted <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of thirty-six F-105 strike aircraft from the 355th and 388th Tactical Fighter Wings based in Thailand, for the second attack on Yen Vien. The 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron provided two flights of F-4 Phantoms, ‘Ford’ flight and ‘Falcon’ flight. The mission was led by Colonel Nicholas J. Donelson with Olds, who spearheaded Operation Bolo back in January, as the leader of the escort formation. At 1:45pm on 23 August, North Vietnamese radars detected a flight of 40 U.S aircraft approaching Hanoi from Sam Neua, in neighboring Laos.|$|E

5|$|On 22December 1940, as the Allies {{advanced}} {{along the}} Libyan coast to Bardia, Rawlinson's rank of flying officer was made substantive; {{it would be}} the highest permanent rank he received during the war. Four days later, he was among <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of eight Gladiators that attacked ten Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers and their escort of twenty-four CR.42s; the Australians claimed two CR.42s destroyed, and five damaged including one probably destroyed, which was credited to Rawlinson. On 22January 1941, Rawlinson and Flying Officer Wilfred Arthur were despatched in Gladiators to attack an Italian schooner reported off Tobruk; they machine-gunned the vessel, setting it on fire. Three days later, Rawlinson claimed two Fiat G.50 fighters damaged after five of the Italian monoplanes attacked <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of five Gladiators patrolling near Mechili. He was notified of his promotion to temporary flight lieutenant, effective from New Year's Day, on 27January.|$|E

5|$|As the two P-51s {{crossed over}} the Seine and reached Rambouillet, they sighted <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of enemy aircraft. Brief bursts of machine gun fire {{dispatched}} four Focke-Wulf Fw 56 trainers—two falling to MacLachlan. Their victims were from JG 105. Gefreiter Walter Seigler was killed in Wrk. Nr. 1868 and Kurt Prager died in Wrk Nr. 2438. Gefreiter Alois Erdl was wounded and the aircraft written off and the fourth was able to force-land safely, damaged. Gefreiter Gotze-Gerd Kuhn was unhurt. They continued their hunt and flying near Bretigny spotted two Ju 88 night fighters or bombers coming into land. MacLachlan destroyed the first and shared the second with Page. Both aircraft belonged to IV./Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6—Bomber Wing 6). The pilots—Gefreiter Gerhard Zimmermann and Unteroffizier Karl Brocks—were killed. The Mustangs retreated when the airfield defences retaliated with gunfire. MacLachlan and Page returned at 1,000 feet and crossed the coast south-west of Dieppe and crossed between Brighton and Newhaven upon their return. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC while Page received the DFC.|$|E

5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects <b>a</b> <b>formation,</b> play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed <b>a</b> <b>formation</b> similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
