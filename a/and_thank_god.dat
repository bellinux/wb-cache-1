While {{performers and}} singers garnered much public attention, record producers {{working behind the}} scenes {{played an important role}} in developing the [...] "disco sound". Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) <b>and</b> <b>Thank</b> <b>God</b> It's Friday (1978) contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity.

"Ocampo {{suggested}} if Bashir's {{stash of}} money were disclosed (he put the figure at $9bn), {{it would change}} Sudanese public opinion from him being a 'crusader' {{to that of a}} thief," [...] one US official stated. [...] "Ocampo reported Lloyds bank in London may be holding or knowledgeable of the whereabouts of his money," [...] the report says. [...] "Ocampo suggested exposing Bashir had illegal accounts would be enough to turn the Sudanese against him." [...] A leak from WikiLeaks allegedly reveals that the Sudanese president had embezzled US$9billion in state funds, but Lloyds Bank of England [...] "insisted it was not aware of any link with Bashir," [...] while a Sudanese government spokesman called the claim [...] "ludicrous" [...] and attacked the motives of the prosecutor.

He added [...] "The same decision in which [...] Darfur case [...] being transferred to the court stated that the American soldiers [...] would not be questioned by the court, so it is not about justice, it is a political issue." [...] Al Bashir accused Luis Moreno Ocampo, the ICC's chief prosecutor since 2003, of repeatedly lying in order to damage his reputation and standing. Al Bashir said [...] "The behaviour of the prosecutor of the court, it was clearly the behaviour of a political activist not a legal professional. He is now working on a big campaign to add more lies." [...] He added [...] "The biggest lie was when he said I have $9bn in one of the British banks, <b>and</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God,</b> the British bank and the [...] finance minister … denied these allegations."
