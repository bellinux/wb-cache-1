40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} trade liberalization in a non-integrated industry where a marketing agency controls the supply of a necessary input {{in the production of}} a processed commodity. Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an increase in the minimum <b>access</b> <b>commitment</b> of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers if the marketing agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist. Conversely, if the marketing agency pursues some specific non-economic objectives, it is shown that increases in the minimum <b>access</b> <b>commitment</b> holding the tariff rates constant can lead to higher retail prices and thus negate the benefits of trade liberalization for consumers. ...|$|E
40|$|A supply {{management}} system governs Canada’s poultry sector. Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs), with prohibitive above-quota tariffs and low in-quota tariff, mimic import-quotas limit international competition in Canada’s poultry market. The quota {{part of the}} TRQs is a minimum <b>access</b> <b>commitment</b> under international trade agreement that {{is defined as a}} fraction of domestic production. We show in a 3 -stage game involving negotiations between retailers and processors and between processors and farms that increasing minimum <b>access</b> <b>commitment</b> under current trade agreements can produce Metzler effects with larger price increases observed at the farm and processing levels. Simulations based on 2008 data support the Metzler paradox and shed light on import license allocations between retailers and poultry processors in Canada.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{bilateral}} dumping model in which the minimum access level is endogenous. Regions compete with one another using Cournot conjectures and engage in interregional dumping as in Brander and Krugman’s (1983) reciprocal dumping model. International trade is hindered by restrictive Tariff rate Quota (TRQs). The model features two regions and one product. We derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to observe interregional trade and those under which trade does not exist. The results show that the world price and the difference in production costs between regions {{play an important role in}} determining whether bilateral trade exists. In the presence of bilateral trade, the region with the largest market size will obtain the largest share of import volumes permitted under the minimum access system while in the absence of interregional trade, the distribution of import permits between regions will also depends on the product cost asymmetry. When only the most efficient region exports to the least efficient region, production costs asymmetry, transaction costs and world price level determine whether the smaller or larger region obtains the larger share of product import allowed under minimum <b>access</b> <b>commitment.</b> In all cases, we show that in a country like Canada, creation of “artificial barriers” to interprovincial trade of products under supply management system lowers the welfare of at least one of the regions, along with the global welfare...|$|E
40|$|Patient {{engagement}} {{has become}} a widely used term, but remains a poorly understood concept in healthcare. Citations for the term {{during the past two}} decades have increased markedly throughout the healthcare-related disciplines without a common definition. Patient engagement has been credited for contributing to improved outcomes and experiences of care. Means of identifying and evaluating practices that facilitate patient engagement in care have become an ethical imperative for patient-centered care. This process begins with a definition of the concept. 	Concept analysis is a means of establishing a common definition of a concept through identification of its attributes, antecedents and consequences within the context of its use. Concept analysis is a methodology that has been used in social science and nursing as a means to resolve conceptual barriers to theory development in an evolving field. The methodological theory was based in the analytic philosophical tradition and sustained during the 20 th century by the strength of philosophical positivism in the health sciences. This concept analysis is guided procedurally by Rogers’ evolutionary approach that incorporates postmodern philosophical principles and well-defined techniques. This dissertation is informed by the expanded and updated perspective of the neomodern era in nursing research, which advances the concept analysis methodology further. 	An analysis of the concept underlying the term patient engagement in the scientific literature revealed four defining attributes: personalization, <b>access,</b> <b>commitment</b> and therapeutic alliance. These defining attributes were derived through thematic analysis of over 100 individual attributes shared among six categories and three domains. The resultant definition revealed that patient engagement is both process and behavior shaped by the relationship between patient and provider and the environment where healthcare delivery takes place. Patient engagement is defined as the desire and capability to actively choose to participate in care in a way uniquely appropriate to the individual, in cooperation with a healthcare provider or institution, for the purposes of maximizing outcomes or improving experiences of care. 	In addition to the attributes of the concept identified in the literature, themes relevant to patient engagement were identified through inputs from six focus groups of persons living with HIV in New York City. The focus group participants were convened to inform the development of a mobile application designed to support their healthcare needs. Their experiences, insights and expectations were valuable in ascertaining those actions or behaviors that may serve to assist the patient in obtaining and adhering to care. The focus group transcripts were coded twice. The first round occurred prior to the concept analysis of the literature and used emergent coding methodology to capture meanings independent of the findings of the concept analysis. The second round occurred after the concept analysis of the literature and used the resultant attributes to perform a directed concept analysis of the transcripts. The content analyses of the transcripts from the patient perspective supported and reinforced the attributes from the concept analysis. The focus groups also highlighted another important aspect of patient engagement, that of privacy/confidentiality, which had not been specifically addressed in the concept analysis of the literature. 	The definition and the identified attributes serve as a heuristic in designing patient engagement strategies and as a basis for future development of the engagement concept in healthcare. The supporting concepts for engagement, especially the role of empathy in the therapeutic alliance, require further clarification and debate. While patient engagement may be promoted through face-to-face interactions or through health information technology, the defining attributes are invariable and should guide the design of engagement processes and tools. Finally, the value of understanding and exploring the defining attributes of patient engagement in medical and nursing education becomes clear, as is the need for continuing clinical training to support and encourage patient engagement skills...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we employ a computable general {{equilibrium}} model of the Russian economy {{to assess the impact}} of accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). We assess the impact of improved market access for Russia in the markets of its partners and the impact of Russia’s market <b>access</b> <b>commitments</b> to foreigners in both goods and services. The model incorporates productivity effects in both goods and services markets endogenously, through a Dixit-Stiglitz framework. We estimate that Russia will gain about 4. 5 % of the value of Russian consumption in the medium run from WTO accession and up to 54 % in the long run, when the impact on the capital stock in a comparative steady state is taken into account. We decompose the effects and estimate that the largest gains to Russia will derive from increased foreign direct investment in the services sectors in Russia as a result of Russia’s market <b>access</b> <b>commitments</b> under the GATS. Export intensive sectors, such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, chemicals and timber, wood, pulp and paper products are the sectors that expand the most as a result of WTO accession. The numerical model is innovative as it recognizes that foreign direct investment or the availability of foreign expertise is necessary to have foreign firms compete in key business services; and it incorporates a Dixit-Stiglitz-framework with the FDI assumption to endogenously capture increases in total factor productivity from foreign direct investment liberalization...|$|R
