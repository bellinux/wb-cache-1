5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases; {{in one of the}} cases, the player also controls Edgeworth's father Gregory. The gameplay is mostly the same <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> game, , and is divided into two types of phases: investigations and rebuttals.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Benfica {{were stopped}} in the quarter-finals by Ajax, after a replay in Paris. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> season's final, Benfica conceded three goals during extra-time and were eliminated. In 1969–70, Benfica fell {{in the second round}} against Scottish team and eventual finalists Celtic in a coin toss decision.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the FLEX 2 at Culebra in January 1936, and then visited New Orleans, during Mardi Gras. She went to Norfolk for a major {{overhaul}} that lasted through the spring of 1936. After completing the overhaul, the ship took another midshipmen crew to European waters; she called in the ports of Portsmouth, England, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Cherbourg, and returned to Annapolis, in August. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year, she conducted another Reserve training cruise, and then went into drydock for an overhaul in Norfolk. The remainder of the 1930s followed a similar pattern; in 1937, the midshipmen training cruise went to Europe, but the 1938 and 1939 cruises remained in the western Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two drives, Virginia Tech {{relied upon}} its rushing offense: The first five plays {{of the drive}} were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then {{switched}} gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense allowed a 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again allowed a long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34-14 lead with 5:14 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> winter, Simpson {{went on a}} skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, {{breaking}} his right tibia, and his leg was in a plaster cast {{until the end of}} February. He missed contract races, crucial training and most of the spring classics. Simpson began riding again in March, and in late April started, but did not finish, Liège–Bastogne–Liège.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> years, {{there were}} two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was {{reconfirmed}} 32 times {{according to}} Sir Edward Coke, and possibly {{as many as}} 45 times. Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> century, parliaments often exacted confirmation {{of it from the}} monarch. The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use}} of stunt doubles. The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} {{international}} series in South Africa, Key returned to domestic action with Kent. While not having as successful a season <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year, he still scored over 1,500runs. This included two centuries {{in the same}} match against Surrey, during the second of which he shared a county third-wicket record partnership of 323 with Martin van Jaarsveld. At {{the end of the}} season, Key was named the new county captain following the resignation of David Fulton, a role he took on in order to help his chances of regaining a place in the England side.|$|E

5|$|Garry Sobers was {{the captain}} for the West Indies, while England had three captains: Mike Smith (first Test), Cowdrey (second-fourth Test) and Brian Close (fifth Test) during the five Test series. The West Indies team {{was not as}} strong <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> series, but many of their {{deficiencies}} were glossed over by Sobers' exceptional all-round performance. He scored centuries in three Test matches and claimed five wicket innings hauls in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just nine}} turns, the fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their power units to their potential. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two wet weather compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} and better-known version of Compert Con Culainn, Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> version, the Ulstermen go hunting {{a flock of}} magical birds, are {{overtaken}} by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E

At the Australian Open, she was {{defeated}} {{in the third round}} of the singles event by German Sabine Lisicki. In contrast, she partnered with Vera Zvonareva <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> season and won her second Grand Slam doubles title against the Italian duo Errani and Vinci, defeating them in a three sets final. It was her best doubles result since 2009. It was the first time since 2008 that an unseeded pair won the Australian Open doubles title.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
5|$|The Budapest Gambit saw a {{short-lived}} revival in 1984–85 when Chess Informant included three games (as many <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> fifteen years), all played {{at a high}} level of competition, and all won by Black. But White players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3. In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit almost never appears at the highest level. Its most recent appearance was when Richárd Rapport defeated Boris Gelfand with Black using the opening in round 2 of the 2014 Tata Steel Chess competition.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy III combines {{elements of}} the first two Final Fantasy games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in the same fashion.|$|E
5|$|With four {{consecutive}} victories after the loss, including {{a win over}} then-No.16 Virginia, the Hokies won the Coastal division and secured a bid to the 2007 ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, Florida. There, they faced a rematch with Boston College, champions of the Atlantic Division. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> matchup, defense dominated, but unlike in the earlier matchup, Matt Ryan was unable to seize the victory. Two fourth-quarter interceptions by Virginia Tech sealed the Hokie win and an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl game.|$|E
5|$|After almost {{achieving}} a treble in the 1992–93 season, Al-Talaba were managed by Hussein Saeed {{in the first}} half of the 1993–94 season and Ayoub Odisho in the second; they finished in third place with 75 points. In the 1993 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, they came second in the Group One table behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba met Al-Zawra'a for the third time in a row and won 3–1. In the final, they faced Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the second time and defeated them 2–1 at the Al-Shaab Stadium, winning their second successive Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup under the management of Saeed. In the 1993–94 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba again faced Al-Zawra'a in the final but lost by the same score <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> season, 2–1. In the 1994–95 Iraqi National League, Al-Talaba finished fourth with 105 points, two points behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya in second place and Najaf in third. In the last round, Al-Talaba faced Al-Zawra'a needing a win to finish second, but they lost 2–1. In the fourth edition of the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya but lost 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.|$|E
