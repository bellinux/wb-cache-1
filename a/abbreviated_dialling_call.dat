In this paper, we present how to employ an automated system for proving properties of formal specications of telephony services. We outline a technique to specify telephony services at an abstract level. The methodology we have developed allows the use of automated deduction systems for o-line detection of interactions from the user {{point of view and}} helps for their resolution. 1 Introduction For the past few years, a continuously increasing number of telecommunication services and service features have been supplied by telephone networks, such as <b>Call</b> Forwarding, <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Dialling,</b> Originating <b>Call</b> Screening. It is assumed that each feature added to a telephony system modies the behaviour of the system.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} known examples are emergency telephone numbers such as 9-9-9, 1-1-2 and 9-1-1. Other services {{may also be}} available through <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> numbers, such as the other of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) besides 9-1-1. State highway departments {{in recent years have}} used <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> codes to allow drivers to obtain information about road conditions or to reach the state highway patrol. Examples are *55 in Missouri and Oklahoma, or *FHP which connects to the Florida Highway Patrol.|$|R
5000|$|An N11 code ("N-one-one" [...] code) or N11 {{number is}} a three-digit <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> {{telephone}} number within the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) which allows access to specific services.|$|R
50|$|Carriers {{refer to}} the {{shortened}} number sequences as <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> codes (ADCs). Unlike SMS shortcodes, they are generally not automatically synchronized across carriers. ADCs are provisioned separately for mobile networks versus landline networks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> {{is the use}} of a {{very short}} digit {{sequence}} to reach specific telephone numbers, such as those of public services. The purpose of such numbers is to be universal, short, and easy to remember. Typically they are two or three digits.|$|R
50|$|A mobile {{dial code}} {{is not the}} same as an <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dial</b> code which only {{supports}} voice calls, basically abbreviating a standard phone number and connecting the caller to a person or machine (interactive voice response system or voicemail system) that answers the call.|$|R
50|$|Short codes, {{or short}} numbers, are short digit sequences, {{significantly}} shorter than telephone numbers, {{that are used}} to address messages in the Multimedia Messaging System (MMS) and short message service (SMS) systems of mobile network operators. In addition to messaging, they may be used in <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{customers}} of some telephone companies in Canada {{and in the}} U.S., 611 is the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> telephone number used to report a problem with telephone service, or with a payphone. It is an N11 code of the North American Numbering Plan that are used for special services.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a one-year}} {{permissive}} dialing period when either/both the old 809 {{and the new}} 784 {{could be used for}} <b>dialing</b> <b>calls</b> to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Mandatory use of 784 for <b>dialing</b> <b>calls</b> to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines became effective by June, 1999.|$|R
50|$|In Canada and the United States, the 711 {{telephone}} number {{is used for}} the Telecommunications Relay Service to translate from TDD for the deaf to speech, and vice versa.

50|$|This {{safety measure}} not only helps prevent damage that {{interrupts}} telecommunications, {{but also the}} cutting of subterranean power lines, water mains, and natural gas pipes. Underground utilities are located via color-coded markings typically up to and not past the user's service connection or meter. Lines {{on the other side}} of the meter or service connection are considered to be part of the customer's property and will typically not be located by these services. Establishment of an <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> number for this purpose was required by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{service codes}} {{may also be}} {{considered}} as <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing,</b> though these prefix the special touch-tone characters * and # (or often 11 for pulse dialing) instead of using only numerals. Most are used to access calling features rather than a called party, and some are specific to each telephone company. Some are used only locally or regionally (such as *FHP (*347) to reach the Florida Highway Patrol); other codes as short as one numeral (like *1) are used to report breaking news or traffic to the newsrooms of local news radio or TV stations.|$|R

50|$|Geographic area codes were {{designed}} {{based on previous}} 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the analog trunk switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes. When calling within Belarus add 0 to the trunk prefix. This way dialing within the country is practically unchanged. In 2003 the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>dialing</b> within areas was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit trunk prefix. Previously {{it was possible to}} dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80-AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number.|$|R

Furthermore, the 911 Act supports individual states 2 ̆ 7 efforts to develop comprehensive emergency communications. Although improving the 911 system and saving lives by developing an end-to-end emergency communications network are commendable goals, this Note argues that the anemic 911 Act is an important first step, but accomplishes little beyond merely establishing 911 as the universal emergency telephone number...|$|R
