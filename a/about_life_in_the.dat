5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged {{the two of them}} to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E

25|$|Walking with Monsters (also {{distributed}} as Before the Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters or Walking with Monsters - Life Before Dinosaurs) is {{a three-part}} British documentary film series <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Paleozoic, and briefly into the Mesozoic, bringing to life extinct arthropods, fish, amphibians, synapsids, and reptiles. As with previous Walking with... instalments, it is narrated by Kenneth Branagh. Using state-of-the-art visual effects, this prequel to Walking with Dinosaurs shows an epic 300 million year war between creatures before the dinosaurs. The series {{draws on the}} knowledge of over 600 scientists and depicts Paleozoic history, from the Cambrian Period (530 million years ago) to the Early Triassic Period (248 million years ago). It was {{written and directed by}} Tim Haines. As with some of the other BBC specials, it was renamed in North America, where its title was Before the Dinosaurs: Walking with Monsters. It has also aired as a two-hour special on the Canadian and American Discovery Channel with yet another narrator, although Branagh's narration can still sometimes be heard.

Dawson: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl, disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras.

500|$|In 2009 a {{panel of}} representatives, {{including}} Sarah MacLachlan of House of Anansi Press, John Fraser of Massey College and Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht, selected Douglas Coupland to deliver the 2010 Massey Lectures.

Coupland did not immediately agree but after some thought, accepted the panel's offer. He was given the creative freedom to select how the lecture would be delivered, and chose to write a novel. While previous novelists, such as Margaret Atwood and Thomas King, had delivered traditional academic lectures, Coupland felt that [...] "a narrative seemed like the most efficient and accessible way of putting forth a large number of propositions <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 2010." ...|$|E

Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new {{and came up with a}} cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons, which has since aired [...] In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X.
