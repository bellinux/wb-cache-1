5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester,</b> in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E
5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his performance as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, {{he had to}} double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester.</b> The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

Although cognitions are important, little research has examined child molesters' thoughts about themselves {{in relation to their}} engagement in treatment. In this study, the NEO-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was administered to 67 <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> <b>Child</b> sexual offenders rated themselves and their view of <b>a</b> typical <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> using two NEO-PI-R versions. The degree to which child sex offenders identify themselves with their view of <b>a</b> typical <b>child</b> <b>molester,</b> and this agreement's relation with engagement in treatment, were investigated.

500|$|The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch horror film written, directed, and co-produced by Tom Six. The film {{tells the}} story of a German surgeon who kidnaps three {{tourists}} and joins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming a [...] "human centipede", a conjoined triplet. It stars Dieter Laser as the creator of the centipede, Dr. Josef Heiter, with Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> by stitching his mouth to the anus of a [...] "fat truck driver". Inspiration for the film also came from Nazi medical experiments carried out during World War II, such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E

Youth reported they {{had moved to the}} South Park Blocks because they had been kicked out of Pioneer Courthouse Square and O'Bryant Square. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> known as [...] "Krusty the Troll" [...] who preyed on homeless teens in the South Park Blocks, was charged with 79 counts of sex crimes in 1996.

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, {{and he began to}} develop the idea. He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over [...] "unbelievable" [...] monster films, and said that he gets [...] "a rash from too much political correctness." [...] Major influences for The Human Centipede were Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch. Further inspiration came from Six's previous work as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother, where {{he had been able to}} observe people who [...] "did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 18, the Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a {{criminal}} investigation on Jackson. The same day, Jordan Chandler's mother told police {{that she did not}} believe Jackson had molested her son. On August 21, a search warrant was issued, allowing police to search Jackson's Neverland Ranch. Police questioned 30 children who were friends of Jackson, with all stating that Jackson was not <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>molester.</b> A police officer involved in the investigation told The Los Angeles Times that no evidence (medical, photographic or video) could be found that would support {{a criminal}} filing. The same day the allegations were made public, Jackson began the third leg of his Dangerous World Tour in Bangkok. On August 24, Jackson's investigator held a press conference accusing Chandler of trying to extort $20 million from the singer, although the investigator failed to mention that Jackson had given several counter-offers. On August 25, Jackson's young friends, Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in the same bed as Jackson, but nothing sexual in nature had occurred. Jackson's family soon held a press conference of their own to show support, saying it was their [...] "unequivocal belief" [...] that Michael had been made a victim of a cruel and obvious attempt to take advantage of his fame and wealth. The police then began an investigation into Evan Chandler's prior actions and found that he was $68,400 behind in his child support payments, even though he was well-paid as a dentist. On November 8, police searched the Jackson family home, Hayvenhurst, but found nothing of importance to add to their investigation. According to internal reports from the LA County DCFS at the time, Chandler's story remained largely consistent but dates, places, times and some details were inconsistent. According to reports, the DCFS had investigated Jackson beginning in August 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
