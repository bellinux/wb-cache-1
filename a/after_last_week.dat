Danni Allen, last season's winner, returns to the ranch to give the contestants Subway lunch, in which each healthy sub has only 6-10 grams of fat. At the weigh-in, the red team kept continuing the winning streak with David losing 17 lbs.

However, Bob, seeing that every member of his team needs every push, decides to use his trainer save on Matt to keep him going.|$|E
