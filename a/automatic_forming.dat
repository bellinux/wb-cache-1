40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} an image mosaic {{application}} and investigate the color rendering performances obtained with various color spaces, among which the nonlinear LUX transform, {{that is based}} on a logarithmic image processing model and on biological evidence about the retina processing within the human visual system. We focus on the color matching step for <b>automatic</b> <b>forming</b> of the mosaic image (without any user interaction nor color correction post-processing). We derive a semi-normalized version of the LUX transform, and test its benefits for the mosaic color rendering. The LUX nonlinear color space exhibits a nice behavior of adaptation to light context (logarithmic compression), which is in agreement with the biological processing made by the cones in the eye retina. We compare its behavior for color discrimination and color adaptation with other models proposed in the literature. We show qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate the improvement achieved by the LUX transform (in terms of color contrast and peak signal to noise ratio PSNR) for building the mosaic...|$|E

40|$|Some future {{telephone}} {{services will}} require that ongoing calls be interrupted briefly {{so that one}} of the parties can receive data transmitted over the voice path. For example, the new service Caller ID on Call Waiting (CIDCW) will allow sub-scribers who are off-hook and engaged in conversation to receive data indicating the name and telephone number of a new caller, but the data transmission will produce a break of approximately 1 s. The question arises, then, as to what method should be used to interrupt calls to transmit data. In an <b>automatic</b> <b>form</b> of CIDCW, data would be sent without user control once there is a new call, producing an unexpected break in ongoing conversations. In a user-controlled form, users would hear a tone when there is a new call and initiate the data transmission by pressing a button. A study was conducted to examine how subjects would react to breaks in their telephone conversations and to determine which form of CIDCW was more favorable. Subjects acting as CIDCW subscribers liked both forms of the service, but they preferred the <b>automatic</b> <b>form,</b> which was also rated as more acceptable and easier to use. Furthermore, compared with the user-controlled form, auto-matic CIDCW resulted in quick, error-free performance. Subjects acting as the far-end party also favored the <b>automatic</b> <b>form,</b> provided that they heard silence during the interruptions rather than a tone. Generally the automatic approach was found to be the better way to introduce a 1 -s break into telephone calls...|$|R
