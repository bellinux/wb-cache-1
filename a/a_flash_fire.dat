Passenger Reginald John Dixon tried to free two others trapped near the wing root as the wreckage caught fire. He failed to free them and <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> critically burned him. He died from his injuries two weeks later. Thus three passengers also died and many others sustained injuries.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|On {{her initial}} sea trials, the ship ran aground on the Elbe river due to {{insufficient}} dredging and <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> {{in the engine}} room which resulted in eight crewmen being taken to hospital. On her official trials, she suffered overheating of the turbines and some stability issues were discovered. The trials were therefore abandoned and the builders were called in to carry out emergency work. At the same time, the overnight cruise for the Kaiser was cancelled; it was eventually carried out in July that year.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that caused {{considerable}} smoldering and heavy {{smoke from the}} explosion. Some sailors were overcome and perished due to this dense smoke. Fire control parties were initially confused because they found no active fires. Crew members responding to the General Quarters alarm closed water-tight doors, hatches and vents. This, with outstanding damage control work, kept Helena afloat. Crew members in the engineering sections {{had to resort to}} gas masks due to the smoke. The dead were taken dockside after the first attack was concluded. The wounded initially were taken to sickbay and by 1000 hours many were en route to the Naval Hospital.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1995, Mr Dixon, aged 47, and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 when the aircraft crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Palmerston North. Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft to help other passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery and skin grafts. Mr Dixon remained in a coma, and although he made some initial improvement, his condition worsened and he died two weeks later, the fourth victim of the crash. The situation in which Mr Dixon found himself was extremely dangerous and he displayed great bravery in returning to the aircraft, although injured, to help other passengers which subsequently resulted in the loss of his own life. His bravery undoubtedly ensured that the loss of life was not greater.|$|E
25|$|In {{the battle}} for first Fässler held off another {{challenge}} from Bernhard, while Jani rejoined in track in fourth place narrowly ahead of Nakajima in the No. 5 Toyota. The contest for second in LMGTE Pro continued with the top four cars running closely together without any action until Tincknell overtook Bruni around the inside for fourth position at the first corner. The stewards elected not to take any action over the collision between Jani and Mücke at turn one, and Filipe Albuquerque overtook Nicolas Minassian for fifth position in LMP2. The first round of lead car pit stops for car adjustments and driver changes commenced after 50 minutes when both Audi cars made pit stops. After the pit stops, Hartley took over the No. 1 Porsche and gained the lead because both Audi entries were delayed by slower cars. Fuel went onto the hot exhaust of the second-placed No. 66 Ford GT in LMGTE Pro which did not have its breather cap closed and it caused <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire.</b> Andy Priaulx, who had taken over from Tincknell, exited the car and course officials and the team's crew members were required to extinguish the flames. The fire damaged the car's turbocharger, causing it to run at a reduced pace.|$|E

McNamara and Inkpen then set out on foot {{in the direction of the}} fire. As there was bright moonlight, they were able to hurry through the bush. After about half an hour, they came upon a scene of devastation. They were astonished to find an elderly man in a dazed state wandering around the burning wreckage. He gave his name and explained that he had been a passenger on a large aircraft. He had survived the crash despite being badly burned. No one else was found alive.|$|E

2500|$|Van Zyl {{discovered}} that the front-right pallet was the [...] "seat" [...] of the fire. The manifest said that pallet mostly comprised computers in polystyrene packaging. The investigators said that the localised fire likely {{came in contact with}} the packaging and produced gases that accumulated near the ceiling. They also said that gases ignited into <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that affected the entire cargo hold. The cargo fire of Flight 295 did not burn lower than one metre above the cargo floor. The walls and ceiling of the cargo hold received severe fire damage. Van Zyl ended his investigation without discovering why the fire started.|$|E
2500|$|A South African {{government}} chemist {{examined a}} microscopic particle on the nylon netting {{next to the}} front-right pallet on Flight 295. The chemist found that the airflow patterns on the iron suggested that it travelled at a high velocity while in a molten state; therefore the fire on Flight 295 may have not been <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> triggered by packaging. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this {{would suggest that the}} source of the fire would have had properties like a sparkler, with the source including its own oxidising agent. [...] A British fire and explosion analyst examined the exterior skin of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius. [...] Bereswill said that {{it would be difficult for}} a fire to burn through the skin of an aircraft in-flight because of the cool airflow outside the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The first near-kill of the Run to the South {{occurred}} at 16:00, when a [...] shell from Lützow wrecked the [...] "Q" [...] turret amidships on Beatty's flagship Lion.
