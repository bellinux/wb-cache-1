5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. <b>Acetonitrile</b> is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for <b>acetonitrile</b> (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in <b>acetonitrile,</b> the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in <b>acetonitrile</b> well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in <b>acetonitrile</b> or 10% diethylamine in <b>acetonitrile.</b> This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in <b>acetonitrile</b> solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (<b>acetonitrile).</b> Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, {{but also in}} the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot <b>acetonitrile.</b> The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in <b>acetonitrile</b> is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E
25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are <b>acetonitrile</b> and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% <b>acetonitrile</b> (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% <b>acetonitrile</b> over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% <b>acetonitrile</b> for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% <b>acetonitrile.</b>|$|E

25|$|Reaction with {{trimethylsilyl}} iodide in <b>acetonitrile</b> {{followed by}} methanol is a mild and versatile method of deprotecting Boc-protected amines.|$|E
25|$|Butadiene is {{typically}} {{isolated from the}} other four-carbon hydrocarbons produced in steam cracking by extractive distillation using a polar aprotic solvent such as <b>acetonitrile,</b> N-methylpyrrolidone, furfural, or dimethylformamide, from which it is then stripped by distillation.|$|E
25|$|The Boc {{group can}} be added to the amine under aqueous {{conditions}} using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate {{in the presence of a}} base such as sodium bicarbonate. Protection of the amine can also be accomplished in <b>acetonitrile</b> solution using 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the base.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} proton sponges {{are known}} with even higher basicity. 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN is prepared from 1,8-diaminonaphthalene by reaction with tris(dimethylamino)bromophosphonium bromide {{in the presence}} of triethylamine. HMPN has a pKBH+ of 29.9 in <b>acetonitrile</b> which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a nitrile is CH3CN, <b>acetonitrile,</b> also known as methyl cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A {{functional}} group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called cyanohydrin. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release hydrogen cyanide. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N− ion {{are referred to as}} cyanides.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to sodium chloride and potassium chloride, caesium chloride readily dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Caesium chloride has also {{a relatively high}} solubility in formic acid (1077 g/L at 18°C) and hydrazine; medium solubility in methanol (31.7 g/L at 25°C) and low solubility in ethanol (7.6 g/L at 25°C), sulfur dioxide (2.95 g/L at 25°C), ammonia (3.8 g/L at 0°C), acetone (0.004% at 18°С), <b>acetonitrile</b> (0.083 g/L at 18°С), ethylacetates and other complex ethers, butanone, acetophenone, pyridine and chlorobenzene.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, {{potassium bromide}} {{is a white}} crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in <b>acetonitrile.</b> In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to {{the properties of the}} potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).|$|E
25|$|The trimerization {{of a part}} of a nitrile {{molecule}} and {{two parts}} of acetylene into pyridine is called Bönnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using <b>acetonitrile</b> as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.|$|E
25|$|Ethyl acetate is used {{primarily}} as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, {{it is commonly used}} to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and <b>acetonitrile</b> are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener. Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the scent of the perfume on the skin.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{composition}} of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process {{taking place in the}} column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid–liquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in <b>acetonitrile</b> (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).|$|E

500|$|N,N,N'N-Tetraethylthiuram {{disulfide}} (TETD) is soluble in <b>acetonitrile</b> and is commercially available. [...] However, the sulfurization {{reaction of}} an internucleosidic DNA linkage with TETD requires 15 min, {{which is more}} than 10 times as slow as that with compounds 3 and 4.|$|E
500|$|A 0.02–0.2 M {{solution}} of nucleoside phosphoramidite (or {{a mixture of}} several phosphoramidites) in <b>acetonitrile</b> is activated by a 0.2–0.7 M {{solution of}} an acidic azole catalyst, 1H-tetrazole, 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazole, 2-benzylthiotetrazole, 4,5-dicyanoimidazole, or a number of similar compounds. A more extensive information {{on the use of}} various coupling agents in oligonucleotide synthesis {{can be found in a}} recent review. [...] The mixing is usually very brief and occurs in fluid lines of oligonucleotide synthesizers (see below) while the components are being delivered to the reactors containing solid support. The activated phosphoramidite in 1.5– 20-fold excess over the support-bound material is then brought in contact with the starting solid support (first coupling) or a support-bound oligonucleotide precursor (following couplings) whose 5'-hydroxy group reacts with the activated phosphoramidite moiety of the incoming nucleoside phosphoramidite to form a phosphite triester linkage. The coupling of 2'-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites is very rapid and requires, on small scale, about 20s for its completion. In contrast, sterically hindered 2'-O-protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites require 5-15 min to be coupled in high yields. The reaction is also highly sensitive to the presence of water, particularly when dilute solutions of phosphoramidites are used, and is commonly carried out in anhydrous <b>acetonitrile.</b> Generally, the larger the scale of the synthesis, the lower the excess and the higher the concentration of the phosphoramidites is used. In contrast, the concentration of the activator is primarily determined by its solubility in <b>acetonitrile</b> and is irrespective of the scale of the synthesis. Upon the completion of the coupling, any unbound reagents and by-products are removed by washing.|$|E

The most {{important}} such solvents are dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO, and <b>acetonitrile,</b> CH3CN, as these solvents has been widely {{used to measure the}} acid dissociation constants of organic molecules. Because DMSO is a stronger proton acceptor than H2O the acid becomes a stronger acid in this solvent than in water. Indeed, many molecules behave as acids in non-aqueous solution that do not do so in aqueous solution. An extreme case occurs with carbon acids, where a proton is extracted from a C-H bond.|$|E
500|$|Lead(II) nitrate is {{associated}} with interesting supramolecular chemistry because of its coordination to nitrogen and oxygen electron-donating compounds. The interest is largely academic, but with several potential applications. For example, combining lead nitrate and pentaethylene glycol (EO5) in a solution of <b>acetonitrile</b> and methanol followed by slow evaporation produces a new crystalline material [...] In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO5 chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an equatorial plane {{similar to that of}} a crown ether. The two bidentate nitrate ligands are in trans configuration. The total coordination number is 10, with the lead ion in a bicapped square antiprism molecular geometry.|$|E
500|$|A {{large number}} of {{alternative}} synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions.

[...] Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method3). [...] In this route, allylbenzene is reacted <b>acetonitrile</b> in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate {{which in turn is}} treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate.
