5|$|The first box {{lacrosse}} match {{conducted in}} Australia came about {{as part of}} a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the <b>appeal</b> <b>committee</b> to stage a lacrosse match {{as part of a}} multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia, with P J Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of {{the rules of the game}} from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.|$|E

500|$|The CCDI was cumbersome; twenty-seven {{separate}} procedures had to {{be completed}} before an official could be placed under investigation. Other problems were institutional; for example, the commission had no organisation below the provincial level. In response to the CCDI's failures, the 1955 National Conference established the CCC. Delegates noted that the CCDI's problems were its lack of independence from party committees {{and the lack of}} meaningful collaboration between a control commission at one level and those at higher levels. The institutional balance favouring party committees led some (such as Gao Gang and Rao Shushi) to pack local commissions for discipline inspection (CDI) with loyalists who had no interest in carrying out their responsibilities. The control commissions had the power to <b>appeal</b> <b>committee</b> decisions, and were required to report their work to the higher-level control commission. Unlike the CCDI, the CCC had an organisation below the provincial level. It was empowered to [...] "examine, approve, and change decisions by lower control committees", was required to verify the composition of control committees at the provincial level and below and had the power to investigate unreliable elements at will. Bonds were forged with the Ministry of Supervision (MOS) and the Supreme People's Procuratorate to strengthen the anti-corruption agencies' control of [...] "the rapidly expanding party organisation and an increasingly elaborate state bureaucracy".|$|E
