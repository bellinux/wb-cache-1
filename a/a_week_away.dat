Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) decides in the episode [...] "Born This Way" [...] {{that she wants to}} become prom queen; she sees Karofsky and realizes he would be a credible prom king partner moments before she sees him checking out a male student's butt and also realizes he is as closeted as she is. She then blackmails him into teaming up with her as a pretend couple—beards—and starting an anti-bullying club, with the purpose of getting Kurt to return to McKinley and New Directions. Karofsky apologizes to Kurt for his bullying in a meeting with Will, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), and their respective fathers Paul (Daniel Roebuck) and Burt; Kurt is happy to be able to transfer back.

At the prom, Karofsky is voted prom king but Santana is not elected prom queen; instead, an appalled Kurt is written in and wins. As they take the floor for the traditional prom king and queen dance, Kurt suggests that this is Karofsky's chance to come out and [...] "make a difference", but Karofsky is not ready to do so, and walks away.|$|E

2500|$|The {{secretary-general}} of the Arab League Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam stated {{that the goal of}} Plan Dalet was to drive out the inhabitants of Arab villages along the Syrian and Lebanese frontiers, particularly places on the roads by which Arab regular forces could enter the country.

Through 10 May, Haganah mortars continued to pound the Arab neighbourhoods, causing fires in the marked area and in the fuel dumps, which exploded.

[...] " [...] According to Gilbert, [...] "The Arabs of Safed began to leave, including the commander of the Arab forces, Adib Shishakli (later Prime Minister of Syria). With the police fort on Mount Canaan isolated, its defenders withdrew without fighting. The fall of Safed was a blow to Arab morale throughout the region... With the invasion of Palestine by regular Arab armies believed to be imminent – once the British had finally left in eleven or twelve days' time – many Arabs felt that prudence dictated their departure until the Jews had been defeated and they could return to their homes.|$|E
