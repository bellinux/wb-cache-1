As the name implies, radar absorbing materials or RAM's are coatings whose electric and magnetic properties have been selected to <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> of microwave energy at discrete or broadband frequencies. In military applications low radar cross section (RCS) of a vehicle may be {{required in order to}} escape detection while a covert mission is being carried on.

The design of radar absorbing materials is limited by constraints on the allowable volume and weight of the surface coating, {{and it is difficult to}} design a broadband radar absorbing structure in limited volume. This thesis investigates the use of lossy dielectric materials of high dielectric permittivity in multi- layer composites for the production of low radar cross section (RCS).

The use of hydrogen fuel cells {{for these kinds of}} applications has not been widespread, because storage of a required volume of hydrogen gas has been expensive or complicated.

The focus is in improving the electrochemical contact between a carbon electrode and MDH with carbon nanotubes (CNT). Electrodes were prepared with depositions of single-walled CNTs and multi-walled CNTs.

40|$|Aims. Hard X-ray {{spectra of}} black hole {{binaries}} (BHB) {{are produced by}} Comptonization of soft seed photons by hot electrons near the black hole. The slope of the resulting ray spectra is governed by two main parameters: the electron temperature and the optical depth of the emitting plasma. Given the extreme brightness of V 404 ~Cyg during the 2015 outburst, we aim to constrain the source spectral properties using an unprecedented time resolution in hard X-rays, and to monitor their evolution over the outburst. Methods. We have extracted and analyzed 602 X-ray spectra of V 404 Cyg obtained by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on-board INTEGRAL during the 2015 June outburst, using effective integration times ranging between 8 and 176000 seconds. We have fit the resulting spectra in the 20 - 200 keV energy range. Results. We find that while the light curve and soft X-ray spectra of V 404 Cyg are remarkably {{different from those of}} other BHBs, the spectral evolution of V 404 ~Cyg in hard X-rays and the relations between the spectral parameters are consistent with those observed in other BHBs. We identify a hard branch} where the electron temperature is anti-correlated with the hard X-ray flux, and a soft flaring branch where the relation reverses. In addition, we find that during long X-ray plateaus detected at intermediate fluxes, the thermal Comptonization models fail to describe the spectra. However, the statistics improve if we <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> to vary freely in the fits to these spectra. Conclusions. We conclude that the hard branch in V 404 Cyg is analogous to the canonical hard state of BHBs. V 404 ~Cyg never seems to enter the canonical soft state, although the soft flaring branch bears resemblance to the BHB intermediate state and ultra-luminous state. The X-ray plateaus are likely the result of absorption by a Compton-thick outflow which reduces the observed flux by a factor of about 10. [abridged]Comment: Accepted for publication in A&...|$|E

Within the past 10 years, the growth of architectural centers have begun to dissolve the barrier between the profession and the general public in that their primary function regardless of what form they represent, is to introduce and educate issues of architecture that are an inescapable part of our built environment. An investigation of architectural research institute precedents, would allow for opportunities to understand how they have engaged professional knowledge with a growing educated public opinion.

Introducing a variety of techniques to display information, which go beyond any two dimensional format into a three or four dimensional, more tactile, interactive medium, allowing the observer to become engaged in what they are learning is important for individuals to establish meaning. The facility itself would be a catalyst for learning in which design issues are presented and solutions are viewed by the viewer in a multi-sensory way. The ultimate goal would be able to establish a system of memory responses to allow the general public a better connection with architecture.
