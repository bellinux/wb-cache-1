25|$|The {{photograph}} of Siffleet's execution was discovered {{on the body}} of a dead Japanese major near Hollandia by American troops in April 1944. It {{is believed to be the}} only surviving depiction of a western prisoner of war being executed by a Japanese soldier. The photo was published in Australian newspapers <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> magazine but was thought to depict Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton VC, who had been captured in Salamaua, Papua New Guinea, and beheaded on 29 March 1943. It later went on display at the Australian War Memorial. Elsewhere, despite positive identification in 1945 of Siffleet as the soldier pictured, the image continues on occasion to be misidentified as Newton. Siffleet is commemorated on the Lae Memorial in Lae, Papua New Guinea, together with all other Commonwealth war dead from actions in the region who have no known grave. A memorial park commemorating Siffleet was also dedicated at Aitape in May 2015.|$|E
25|$|APO Leads (stylized as APO LEADS) is a {{leadership}} development program {{organized by the}} national organization of Alpha Phi Omega in the United States. The APO Leads program consists of five individual modular components of leadership development. Each of these modular components focus on skills {{that will help the}} participant be a successful leader and team member in Alpha Phi Omega <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> The five components of APO Leads are Launch, Explore, Achieve, Discover, and Serve. Launch is a pre-requisite for participation in any of the other four courses. At the completion of the series of courses, the participant will have a set of transferable skills that are applicable to Alpha Phi Omega, to the working world, as well as to leadership in other organizations. APO Leads has its roots in an earlier program, the Leadership Development Workshop (LDW). The LDW was an all-day, eight-hour leadership development course that was offered to members during the 1980s and 1990s. It was reorganized into the current APO Leads program, which was rolled out in 2002.|$|E

Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in {{the greatest number of}} deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals.

40|$|This study {{followed}} {{one male}} secondary school cohort over three years, prior and during a positive education implementation at their school. The {{purpose of this}} research was two-fold. Firstly, it investigated the predictive power of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> on the Wellbeing of this cohort. Secondly it examined whether the whole school approach towards positive education had any effect or impact on the predictors and outcome. This research was conducted as Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> have been proposed as protective factors for adolescent wellbeing in theoretical literature, however, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence that demonstrates this. Literature that demonstrates Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are concepts which can successfully be taught as part of a positive education program to enhance student wellbeing is also limited. To conduct the research, a longitudinal mixed method research design was chosen. It followed a sequential exploratory mixed method approach, quantitatively measuring Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life,</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Wellbeing via questionnaires at four time points over two years. The quantitative findings were then used to inform the design of three semistructured focus group interviews with fifteen randomly selected participants. This study found Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> to be strong predictors of secondary boys’ Wellbeing, and, each predictor can be taught as part of a whole school approach towards positive education to enhance wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education is dependent on the successful implementation of the whole school approach. In the case of this study, Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education could be improved by further collaboration with parents/carers/guardians, and, further teacher training on applying student-centred learning to the positive education based classes. These findings are significant as they empirically demonstrate Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are protective factors for male adolescent Wellbeing, and, these predictors are teachable concepts that can be taught as part of a whole school approach to positive education to enhance male adolescent wellbeing...|$|R

25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke {{the wall of}} silence that was surrounding the My Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E

500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matson {{was drawn}} to the East Village, after hearing Allen Ginsberg read Howl at the University of Chicago during the 1959 {{suppression}} controversy over the publication of Beat authors in The Chicago Review, and was welcomed into the Beat Generation. He received broad guidance from Diane di Prima and Ginsberg, and Irving Rosenthal introduced him to the poetry of John Wieners and Michael McClure. Friendships with John Ceely, Martha Muhs, and David Rattray brought Alden Van Buskirk to his attention, and Matson helped in the preparation of Van Buskirk's LAMI. Throughout the mid-1960s Matson's most significant influence, in writing <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> was Herbert Huncke. They discussed writing, ethics, drugs, jazz, Beat figures, and walked the streets of Manhattan, talking with a range of humanity from bums and thieves to workers, artists and members of high society. The environment was ideal for far-ranging explorations of self and the world. In the company of Erin Black and friends, Matson used marijuana, hard drugs, and psychedelics and sought inspiration in literature, in indigenous cultures, in Eastern religion, in music, and in their own creative impulses. Writing was Matson's instrument for articulating insights. The friends strove to separate from the dominant culture and to develop their more native, authentic traits. With the publication of Mainline to the Heart, Matson was coming into his own. In 1968 he traveled to England (a trip planned with Huncke, who withdrew at the last minute) and read poems at University Art Festivals throughout the United Kingdom. Mainline was confiscated by British authorities and later released as [...] "borderline pornographic." ...|$|E
