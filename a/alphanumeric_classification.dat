40|$|In {{patients}} with transposition {{of the great}} arteries, the identification of coronary anatomy is fundamental to optimal surgical outcome. A number of classifications describing the coronary vessels' origin and course in transposition of the great arteries have been published. However, all are limited to operative or pathological case series. They are often alphanumeric classifications that do not lend themselves to clinical practice; they do not consider certain important anatomical variations that may increase surgical morbidity and mortality, nor do they fully delineate coronary anatomy or define the relationship to adjacent structures seen with cardiovascular computed tomography. Using cardiovascular computed tomography for illustrative purposes, we propose and validate a universal sequential descriptive classification and an associated <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>classification</b> {{that may be used}} for all coronary anomalies with or without associated congenital heart disease...|$|E
40|$|A simple <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>classification</b> of {{wood debris}} {{size and shape}} is {{proposed}} for use in river and stream channel surveys and restoration projects. Dividing wood debris length and diameter into seven categories, respectively distinguished by an alphanumeric code, results {{in a total of}} forty-nine distinct size and shape categories. Intended to be analogous to the phi class intervals used to characterize channel bed substrate, this classification allows for rapid visual characterization of the size and potential function of wood debris in wood budgets and channel assessments. Recognition of the role of wood debris in the ecology and geomorphology of forest rivers and streams {{over the past several decades}} established the importance of understanding the wood regime for stream channel assessments. Characterizing the size of wood debris is important because large pieces of wood can deflect flow to form pools and catalyze formation of logjams that trap otherwise mobile sediment and smaller pieces of woo...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen high mannose isomers {{have been}} {{structurally}} characterized within three glycomers, Man 5 GlcNAc 2, Man 7 GlcNAc 2, and Man 8 GlcNAc 2 released from bovine ribonuclease B, six previously unreported. The study {{was carried out}} with a single ion trap instrument involving no chromatography. Three previously characterized isomers from Man 7 and Man 8 (three each) have been identified plus one unreported Man 7 isomer. Incomplete α-glucosidase activity on the Man 6 and Man 7 glycoproteins appears to account for two additional isomeric structures. The preeminence of ion traps for detail analysis was further demonstrated by resolving three new isomers within the Man 5 glycomer summing to the six previously unreported structures in this glycoprotein. All reported structures represent a distribution of Golgi processing remnants that fall within the Man 9 GlcNAc 2 footprint. Topologies were defined by ion compositions along a disassembly pathway while linkage and branching were aided by spectral identity in a small oligomer fragment library. Isomers from this glycoprotein appear to represent a distribution of Golgi processing remnants, and an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>classification</b> scheme has been devised to identify all products. Although numerous analytical strategies have been introduced to identify selected components of structure, {{it has been the}} continued focus of this and previous reports to only build upon protocols that can be integrated into a high throughput strategy consistent with automation. Duplication of these and results from comparable standards could bring an important analytical focus to carbohydrate sequencing that is greatly lacking...|$|E

That may have been her only assignment since the few records of her service extant suggest that she served in the 2nd Naval District, which contained Newport until it was disbanded, and then in the 1st Naval District, which inherited Newport, throughout the remainder of her active career. In July 1920, as the Navy instituted its <b>alphanumeric</b> hull <b>classification</b> system, she received the designation YFB-10. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 20 January 1938.

In the end, {{it was decided to}} send her to the Far East and employ her on the Yangtze Patrol. Two of her 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) single-purpose guns were removed and replaced by two 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) 23-caliber antiaircraft guns.|$|R
