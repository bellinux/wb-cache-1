However, {{it is not known}} to what extent patients express cues or concerns and how providers respond. In this study, we investigated cues and responses that occur in online patient-provider communication at <b>an</b> infertility-specific <b>expert</b> <b>forum.</b> We extracted 106 threads from the multidisciplinary <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> of two Dutch IVF clinics. We performed the following analyses: (1) thematic analysis of patients' questions; and (2) rating patients' emotional and informational cues and subsequent professionals' responses using an adaptation of the validated Medical Interview Aural Rating Scale. Frequencies of themes, frequencies of cues and responses, and sequences (what cue is followed by what response) were extracted. Sixty-five infertile patients and 19 providers participated. The most common themes included medication and lifestyle. Patients gave more informational than emotional cues (106 versus 64). Responses to informational cues were mostly adequate (61 %). The most common response to emotional cues was empathic acknowledgment (72 %). Results indicate that <b>an</b> online <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> could have <b>a</b> positive effect on patient outcomes, which should guide future research.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{classification of}} melanoma and {{the advent of}} new drugs are changing the paradigm of therapy for advanced melanoma. A review of the recent key studies was performed, followed by a discussion in <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>forum.</b> The aim of this review was to generate a therapeutic algorithm for stage IV melanoma. Tumor genotyping for BRAF and/or KIT should be performed before selection of therapy. For most BRAF-mutated melanoma patients and particularly those with a high tumor load, vemurafenib or other BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib are the treatment of choice. KIT inhibitors can be effective in KIT-mutant tumors, especially in those patients with mutations at exons 11 and 13. Ipilimumab is a good option for patients with nontargetable or nondetected mutations and those who progress under therapy with vemurafenib or a KIT inhibitor. There is still a role for conventional chemotherapy either as first-line treatment in BRAF wild-type patients or as salvage therapy in second or third line, or after other treatment modalities. Participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged, either in first or in subsequent lines. New therapeutic options for advanced melanoma are guided by tumor genotyping. The current therapeutic algorithm includes kinase inhibitors, anti-CTLA 4 therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the tumor genotype and response to previous treatments. Participation in clinical trials should always be encouraged because the treatment goal is long-term survival and potential cure in a subset of patients. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) {{recognizes that}} {{behaviors}} {{have a major}} impact on health and well-being. Currently, the USPSTF has 11 behavioral counseling intervention (BCI) recommendations. These BCIs can be delivered in a primary care setting or patients can be referred to other clinical or community programs. Unfortunately, many recommended BCIs are infrequently and ineffectually delivered, suggesting that more evidence is needed to understand which BCIs are feasible and referable. In response, the USPSTF convened <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> in 2013 to inform the evaluation of BCI feasibility. This manuscript reports on findings from the forum and proposes that researchers use several frameworks to help clinicians and the USPSTF evaluate which BCIs work under usual conditions. A key recommendation for BCI researchers is to use frameworks whose components can support dissemination and implementation efforts. These frameworks include the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR), which helps describe the essential components of an intervention, and pragmatic frameworks like Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) or Pragmatic–Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS), which help to report study design elements and outcomes. These frameworks can both guide the design of more-feasible BCIs and produce clearer feasibility evidence. Critical evidence gaps include a better understanding of which patients will benefit from a BCI, how flexible interventions can be without compromising effectiveness, required clinician expertise, necessary intervention intensity and follow-up, impact of patient and clinician intervention adherence, optimal conditions for BCI delivery, and how new care models will influence BCI feasibility...|$|R

40|$|Education and {{training}} of Quantity Surveyors (QS) is subjected to conflicting pressures; firstly from Academic Institutions, which seek to address the academic learning of students; secondly from Industry, which is the graduate employer and thirdly the Professional Body, the regulator of the profession. This can cause tensions between these main stakeholders resulting in greater levels of employer and graduate dissatisfaction and obstacles to early career development of the Quantity Surveying graduate. These problems are further exacerbated in the current economic recession. The research investigates the changing developmental needs of QS within a post recession industrial environment. These must satisfy the aspirations of industrial, academic and professional stakeholders such as the RICS. The RICS provide a comprehensive list of basic, core and optional competencies for the QS. These were comprehensively reviewed to {{provide the basis for}} the survey questionnaires with the use of <b>an</b> <b>Expert</b> <b>Forum</b> and literature.

Therefore, the capabilities of organisations in managing disasters need to be improved, and there should be a way of assessing these capabilities. Hence, this study used capability maturity model (CMM) methodology to develop an assessment method that identifies the built environment flood resilience capabilities of micro, small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). Towards achieving the aim of the study, a conceptual model was developed using the capability areas identified from the literature. The model was then verified and refined by <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>forum.</b> The conceptual model was further improved in case studies, applied in case organisations and after that validated; this resulted in the final model. This study identified 19 capability areas for enhancing built environment flood resilience and developed a capability maturity model that contains maturity level definitions ranging from level 1 (Ad hoc) to level 5 (Optimising). The outcome of this study provides both theoretical and practical contributions to knowledge. Among the theoretical contributions are the identified and verified built environment flood resilience capability areas for MSMEs. The capability areas can be adopted for use in subsequent studies. Also, the application of capability maturity modelling (CMM) in disaster resilience of the built environment is novel, this has expanded the boundary of CMM application.

In addition, the reported incidence of pertussis disease is increasing in adolescents and adults, who not only experience a considerable health burden themselves but also infect vulnerable infants. Conclusions. Current vaccination strategies need to be reinforced. Expanded vaccination should include adding booster doses to existing childhood schedules (preschool or adolescent) and booster doses for those specific adult subgroups that have the highest risk of transmitting B. pertussis infection to infants (i. e., new parents, other contacts of newborns, and health care workers). More epidemiological studies and studies of disease transmission and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination would be valuable, and surveillance, diagnostic improvements, and educational campaigns are needed for implementation.

40|$|The {{success of}} any {{public-private}} partnership (PPP) project {{in a country}} is largely dependent on the country’s maturity on critical success factors (CSFs) that made PPP projects successful. Thus, identification of metrics and standards for measuring the maturity of stakeholder organisations on CSFs for PPP projects implementation remains a challenge. Though studies on CSFs for PPP projects abound, approaches of using CSFs to develop PPP process maturity received scarce attention. Against this backdrop, this research becomes imperative to create efficient and transparent operational strategies {{with a view to}} using CSFs to develop process maturity for stakeholder organisations in PPP projects in Nigeria. Data for the research were obtained through mixed methods approach namely: quantitative and qualitative approaches. Questionnaires were administered on five different stakeholder organisations comprised public sector authorities (i. e. ministries, department, and agencies), concessionaires, local lenders/banks, consultants, and contractors involved in different PPP projects implementation in Nigeria. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Also, the qualitative approach was conducted through <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> and six PPP infrastructure project case studies in Lagos metropolis, Nigeria. The <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> was constituted to refine and verify the conceptual framework developed. Also, structured interviews were conducted with primary stakeholders in the six PPP infrastructure project case studies in the study area. The research identified fourteen CSFs that made PPP infrastructure projects successful in Nigeria. These CSFs were employed for capability maturity levels definition ranging from level 1 (Ad hoc) to level 5 (Optimising) in accordance to Capability Maturity Model (CMM) concept. This {{led to the development of}} stakeholder organisations capability enhancement framework (SOCEF) in PPP infrastructure projects in Nigeria. The framework was validated by PPP experts to ensure it is comprehensive, objective, practical, replicable, reliable, and suitable for use in Nigeria. Thus, a quantitative assessment tool was developed with the framework in assessing the current capability maturity levels of stakeholder organisations involved in PPP infrastructure projects on fourteen CSFs identified in this research. The findings revealed that public sector organisations were between maturity level 1 and maturity level 2 (out of 5 maturity levels) on CSFs applicable to them. The majority of the private sector organisations were in maturity level 2 on CSFs associated with them. It is established in this research that Nigeria’s maturity is between maturity level 1 and maturity level 2 (out of 5 maturity levels) on CSFs that made PPP infrastructure projects successful. The findings emanated from this research provided both the theoretical and practical contributions to knowledge. The theoretical contributions include the methodology for developing capability maturity levels in PPPs, new insights into the usefulness of CSFs in PPP projects, and contributed to the wider body of knowledge of process improvement in the construction industry at large. The practical contributions are the capability level definitions and enhancement framework for PPP practice, and the specific CSFs for PPP infrastructure projects in Nigeria. The framework developed in this research had provided the benchmark for the identification of methodical approach and standard to process improvement in PPP infrastructure projects in Nigeria. It is believed that the framework would provide a useful guide and roadmaps for improvement by indicating ‘what’ needs to be done by stakeholder organisations involved in PPP projects in achieving higher capability maturity levels on identified CSFs for PPP projects in Nigeria and developing countries at large. Thus, the framework could be used to benchmark future studies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Increasingly, higher {{education}} institutions are being held {{to account for the}} performance of their students internally in terms of academic performance and timely program completion, as well as externally through job placement. This challenge is compounded by a range of additional factors including fluctuating, international economic conditions, an increasingly globalised, competitive environment, widespread provision of online qualifications, and high student drop-out rates. There is a pressing need therefore to understand the factors which contribute to positive perceptions of institutional services {{and the way in which}} these drive student retention, especially within the first year experience. This research aims to explore the role of affective commitment in students' perceived satisfaction within the student-university relationship and the effect of this on retention in an Australian tertiary context. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach was adopted using four focus groups and eight in-depth interviews with first year undergraduate students enrolled at a large metropolitan Australian university. In addition, <b>an</b> online <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> was used to obtain qualitative verbatim from 22 internationally-based faculty educators. Findings – The results of this study suggest that the development of deeply entrenched emotional bonds with students is important in facilitating high levels of satisfaction during the first year experience. In addition, a sense of belonging was perceived by faculty as being the primary mechanism for ensuring the retention of students beyond the first year of enrolment. Practical implications – From a managerial perspective, uncovering the nature of student-institution relationships and the importance of affective forms of commitment will enable {{higher education}} institutions to develop more targeted relationship marketing programs to increase student retention. Originality/value – In a unique contribution, this research examines this issue from the perspective of first year students, as well as from an international faculty perspective, enabling a multi-dimensional comparison to be drawn between the perceptions of the student, and the service provider. 24 page(s...|$|R

Central aortic stiffening is {{a major influence on}} central blood pressure, and directly relates to coronary perfusion. The joint session of the International Society of Vascular Health (Eastern Region) and the Ukrainian Congress of Cardiology was held in Kiev, Ukraine, on September 23, 2011; it provided <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> to discuss arterial evaluations, clinical applications, and progress toward translating arterial protection into cardiovascular benefits. The conclusions of the expert panel were: 1. Aortic stiffness is not presently a treatment target but may be useful for substratifying cardiovascular risk in individuals in order to better target the intensity of conventional therapy, and it may be useful in assessing response to treatment. 2. Crosstalk between macro- and microcirculation in hypertension has important implications for pharmacological treatment. An antihypertensive regimen should abolish the vicious cycle between the increased resistance in the microcirculation and the increased stiffness of the larger arteries. Such treatment should be based on drugs with multiple actions on the vascular tree, or on drug combinations that target the various segments of the arterial system. 3. Several blood pressure-independent mechanisms of large artery stiffness exist. Future considerations for clinical understanding of large artery stiffness should involve new drugs and new evaluation methods – with a focus on vascular health, for the initiation of cardiovascular prevention, for newly designed studies for treatment evaluation, and for new studies of drug combinations. 4. Arterial stiffening is a sign of cardiovascular aging and is a major factor affecting the biomechanics of large arteries. Arterial stiffness is an attractive therapeutic target in terms of vascular aging. Healthy lifestyle, physical exercise, and smoking cessation are the most effective ways of preventing and treating early vascular aging. Long-term effects of cardiovascular drugs on arterial stiffness need to be further investigated. 5. The emerging clinical data on the cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) technique of arterial health assessment is presented, showing that the CAVI is elevated in aging, coronary artery diseases, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and stress. The CAVI decreased with the administration of statins, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and calcium channel blockers. The CAVI is suggested as an important predictor of cardiovascular diseases. Future development of a clinical understanding of large artery stiffness is important and should include consideration of new drugs and new evaluation methods, with a focus on vascular health aimed at cardiovascular prevention.
