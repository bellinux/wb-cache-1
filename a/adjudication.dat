The probate records include {{a great deal of information}} from the four years of litigation. A great number of people petitioned the courts to claim title as heirs after the initial 1878 judgement. In the final <b>adjudication,</b> Bernice Pauahi Bishop received two of the nine shares. The remaining seven of the nine shares were divided equally in 1/9th and distributed to Ruth Keelikōlani, Haalilio and Haalelea (namesakes of the historic figures), Kilinahe (Whose grandmother was the older sister of Kanaina's mother and 5 other parties.

40|$|Collateral {{estoppel}} is {{an equitable}} doctrine under which a court gives issue-preclusive effect to {{findings of fact}} or law made in previous proceedings. The U. S. Supreme Court has recently held that under certain circumstances, the determinations of administrative <b>adjudications</b> have collateral estoppel effect in federal court. The Court, however, did not address under which circumstances the determinations of administrative <b>adjudications</b> should have collateral estoppel effect in subsequent administrative <b>adjudications.</b> There has been little clear and consistent reasoning in lower federal courts about when collateral estoppel should apply in administrative <b>adjudications,</b> and administrative agencies vary widely in their application of collateral estoppel when conducting <b>adjudications.</b> This Note argues that neither the balancing test used to apply collateral estoppel in federal court nor the more formalistic per se rules proposed by some commentators are appropriate when applying collateral estoppel between administrative <b>adjudications.</b> Instead, courts should defer to agencies, granting them wide discretion to recognize or not recognize the collateral estoppel effect of prior administrative <b>adjudications...</b>|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} <b>adjudications</b> {{are increasingly}} {{considered to be}} criminal convictions for purposes of sentencing enhancement in subsequent adult proceedings, leading to a renewed call for extension {{of the right to}} jury trial in the juvenile court so as to legitimize the use of <b>adjudications.</b> Such an extension is troubling, however, because regardless of the factfinder, it is improper to equate juvenile delinquency <b>adjudications</b> with criminal convictions for several reasons. First, the juvenile court remains distinct from the criminal court in its purpose and procedure. Second, the prevalence of juvenile pleas raises questions about whether juveniles defend against delinquency charges with the same vigor as they would against criminal charges. Finally, the necessity for a system of transfer into adult criminal court is questionable if <b>adjudications</b> can ex post facto be considered convictions. Although fairness dictates that juvenile <b>adjudications</b> should not be considered convictions, if they are consistently used as such, the infancy defense should be available in the juvenile court...|$|R

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for <b>adjudication,</b> {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K.

While the Justices {{felt that the}} claim of Kalakaua and his sisters had not been proven, they were impressed with that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on testimony and witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: one quarter to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); one quarter each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and one quarter to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the <b>adjudication</b> of his claim.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for <b>adjudication.</b> On 27 April, De Soto continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights <b>Adjudication</b> Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
5|$|His wife Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi was a {{widow and}} niece of Kamehameha I. She was also married to Kamehameha II before he {{converted}} to Christianity {{and gave up}} all but one wife. Kanaʻina and Kekāuluohi lived in a traditional aliʻi style home in a sacred neighborhood in Honolulu called Pohukaina near Kekūanāoʻa, Kaʻahumanu and their offspring. The compound would eventually become the Iolani Palace (the official Royal Residence of the Hawaiian Royal Family) and Palace Walk when Kekūanāoʻa built Hale Aliʻi {{in the center of}} the families estates as a gift to his daughter Victoria Kamāmalu. Kanaʻina kept his property at the palace until his death and would be the only original owner to do so while the Palace was in use, living there through five monarchs, from the 1820s to 1877. Kanaʻina's son, William Charles Lunalilo, was named by Kamehameha III as an heir to the throne of the kingdom and ascended in 1873 while his father still lived. Lunalilo died only a year later, three years before his father's death on March 13, 1877. Having not re-written his will, which left everything to his son who had predeceased, Kanaʻina died intestate. Probate hearings proceeded for 5 years. On final <b>adjudication</b> his property was auctioned with the proceeds going to several of Kanaʻina's cousins including Ruth Keelikōlani and Bernice Pauahi Bishop.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Colorado River {{motivated}} the Montana Legislature to enact critical {{amendments to the}} MWUA in 1979.

It recommended against {{the creation of a}} water court, and instead argued for an administrative process overseen by the agency itself. The subsequent <b>adjudication</b> would be inter se, to meet the requirements of the McCarran Act. Rather than act on the DNRC's proposals, the state legislature established a study committee to make recommendations to the legislature at its next session (to be held in 1979). On April 4, 1979, the legislature voted to include tribal and federal as part of the state's <b>adjudication</b> process. The following day, the federal governments filed four lawsuits in the U.S. District Court seeking to revive the two prior lawsuits as well as initiate four others to protect the water rights of the tribes in Montana.
