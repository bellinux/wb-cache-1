40|$|Vegetation {{altering}} hydrodynamic {{conditions of}} an open channel flow controls the exchanges of sediment, nutrients and contaminants. Thus, {{the knowledge of the}} hydraulic characteristics of flow over vegetation is very important to support the management of fluvial processes. But, the analysis of the hydrodynamic conditions is complex because vegetation is flexible in varying degrees and it oscillates in the flow changing position. Furthermore, because of temporal changing of roughness due to natural vegetative growth, the response of vegetation to the flow can change in time. Many theoretical and experimental investigations have been performed in order to analyze both the mean flow and turbulence structure of open-channel flow (Nezu and Rodi 1986; Lemmin and Rolland 1997; Shvidchenko and Pender 2001). Recent experimental runs carried out in laboratory channels with flexible vegetation, realized by using <b>artificial</b> <b>filaments</b> (Kutija and Hong 1996; Ikeda and Kanazawa 1996), investigated some peculiar characteristics of flow turbulence structure and revealed the generation of periodic organized vortices whose center is located slightly above the top of the vegetation layer. In this paper the flow over real flexible vegetation is experimentally studied. A 2 D-ADV (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter) is used to measure the local flow velocities, for different vegetation concentrations and varying the discharge and the flume slope. The influence of both vegetation concentration and depth/vegetation height ratio on the measured velocity profiles is analyzed. The hyperbolic tangent profile of a pure mixing layer proposed by Ghisalberti and Nepf (2002) is tested and the local flow velocity measures are used to evaluate the mixing-layer parameters. The spectral analysis is operated in order to verify the formation of turbulence structures inside the vegetated layer. A new expression of the turbulent intensity distribution allowing the interpretation of experimental data both inside and above the vegetation layer is also presented...|$|R

On the other hand, recent experimental studies conducted by Termini and Sammartano (2012) in a mobile-bed laboratory channel, and in absence of vegetation, have demonstrated that the formation of coherent turbulence structures {{plays an important role in}} sediment transport and in scouring evolution. In particular, ejection and sweep events contribute significantly to erosion, deposition and sediment suspension. In this paper, in order to give a contribution to the understanding of the rule of vegetation on the analyzed erosion process, experimental results obtained in the same laboratory channel, but with bed covered by flexible vegetation, are presented. Attention is paid to interaction vegetation/erosion both along the vegetated-bed channel reach and downstream of it. In particular, different vegetation patches are experimentally tested and how such vegetation patches serve to obstruct the erosive action of water is discussed...|$|R

Peak current densities are achieved when the pinning center spacing are matched to spacing of the flux line lattice (EL) at field of operation. We {{find that the}} choice of the superconducting alloy as well as the pin material has marked effect on both the characteristic pinning force, F and the critical magnetic field, Hc 2. In addition, the lesign approach or geometry such as the size of the <b>artificial</b> superconducting <b>filament,</b> the area of the pinning material, and the position of the pins can be important factors in determining the strength of the pinning force on the FLL.

40|$|AbstractThe forced reeling of {{silkworms}} {{offers the}} potential to produce a spectrum of silk filaments, spun from natural silk dope and subjected to carefully controlled applied processing conditions. Here we demonstrate that the envelope of stress–strain properties for forced reeled silks can encompass both naturally spun cocoon silk and unnaturally processed <b>artificial</b> silk <b>filaments.</b> We use dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) to quantify the structural properties of these silks. Using this well-established mechanical spectroscopic technique, we show high variation in the mechanical properties and the associated degree of disordered hydrogen-bonded structures in forced reeled silks. Furthermore, we show that this disorder can be manipulated by a range of processing conditions and even ameliorated under certain parameters, such as annealing under heat and mechanical load. We conclude that the powerful combination of forced reeling silk and DMTA has tied together native/natural and synthetic/unnatural extrusion spinning. The presented techniques therefore {{have the ability to}} define the potential of Bombyx-derived proteins for use in fibre-based applications and serve as a roadmap to improve fibre quality via post-processing...|$|R

Previous theoretical and numerical studies have considered the “rotor” model of a cilium in which the filament is coarse grained into a colloidal sphere driven with a given force law along a predefined trajectory to represent the oscillating motion of the cilium. These studies pointed {{to the importance of}} two factors in the emergence of synchronization: the modulation of the driving force around the orbit and the deformability of the trajectory. In this work it is shown via experiments, supported by numerical simulations and theory, that both of these factors are important and can be combined to produce strong synchronization (within a few cycles) even in the presence of thermal noise...|$|R

40|$|Well-motivated {{elementary}} particle {{candidates for the}} dark matter, such as the sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (WDM). For particle masses of order a keV, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation power spectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. We investigate the abundance and structure of WDM haloes and subhaloes on these scales using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similar to the Milky Way's. On scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, the initial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases {{as one of the}} cold dark matter (CDM) haloes previously simulated by Springel et al as part of the Virgo consortium Aquarius project. We have simulated four haloes with WDM particle masses in the range 1. 4 - 2. 3 keV and, for one case, we have carried out further simulations at varying resolution. N-body simulations in which the power spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo <b>artificial</b> fragmentation in <b>filaments</b> producing spurious clumps which, for small masses ( 1. 5 ke...|$|R

The metal and hydrogen absorption features in the artificial spectra closely resemble observed systems {{over a wide range}} in HI column density. Detailed predictions of the column density as a function of impact parameter to protogalactic clumps are presented for HI,CII,CIV,SiIV,NV and OVI. The expected correlations between column densities of different species and their role in understanding the physical properties of the gas from which galaxies form are discussed.

40|$|N-body {{simulations}} {{are essential}} for understanding the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, the discrete nature of these simulations affects their accuracy when modelling collisionless systems. We introduce {{a new approach to}} simulate the gravitational evolution of cold collisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in terms of adaptively refineable "Lagrangian phase space elements". These geometrical elements are piecewise smooth maps between Lagrangian space and Eulerian phase space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function. They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to accurately follow the evolution even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss in detail various one-, two- and three-dimensional test problems to demonstrate the performance of our method. Its advantages compared to N-body algorithms are: i) explicit tracking of the fine-grained distribution function, ii) natural representation of caustics, iii) intrinsically smooth gravitational potential fields, thus iv) eliminating the need for any type of ad-hoc force softening. We show the potential of our method by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter scenario. We discuss how spurious collisionality and large-scale discreteness noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates the <b>artificial</b> fragmentation of <b>filaments.</b> Therefore, we argue that our new approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold and collisionless fluids, and is the first method that allows to explicitly follow the fine-grained evolution in six-dimensional phase space.
