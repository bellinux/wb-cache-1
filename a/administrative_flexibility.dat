We show first that, with full {{knowledge of the}} network, the vendor recommended implementation of port security is both ineffective at preventing {{all three of these}} attacks, and actually decreases the difficulty of performing two of them. Next, we re-examine the attacks under less ideal conditions and demonstrate that they are feasible. Finally, we describe mitigation strategies that reduce the likelihood of success, but we argue that the use of port security as a preventative measure is difficult and may require tradeoffs between security and performance, <b>flexibility,</b> <b>administrative</b> cost, and ease of use.

50|$|From the {{end-user}} perspective, swap {{files in}} versions 2.6.x and later of the Linux kernel are virtually {{as fast as}} swap partitions; the limitation is that swap files should be contiguously allocated on their underlying file systems. To increase performance of swap files, the kernel keeps a map of where they are placed on underlying devices and accesses them directly, thus bypassing the cache and avoiding filesystem overhead. Regardless, Red Hat recommends swap partitions to be used. When residing on HDDs, which are rotational magnetic media devices, one benefit of using swap partitions {{is the ability to}} place them on contiguous HDD areas that provide higher data throughput or faster seek time. However, the <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility</b> of swap files can outweigh certain advantages of swap partitions. For example, a swap file can be placed on any mounted file system, can be set to any desired size, and can be added or changed as needed. Swap partitions are not as flexible; they cannot be enlarged without using partitioning or volume management tools, which introduce various complexities and potential downtimes.|$|E
50|$|To {{address these}} issues, the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the national}} Food Stamp program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a block grant to provide more <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility</b> to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures. After a year of studies and design, it commenced operations on July 1, 1982 with an annual appropriation of $825 million.The new block grant program differed significantly from the former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper discusses {{environmental agreements}} as {{a variant of}} cooperative or negotiated approaches. Environmental agreements are increasingly discussed as a new policy instrument to deal with environmental problems in a flexible manner at low cost. Environmental agreements are negotiated commitments from firms or industrial associations with the government to improve their environmental performance. Agents of the industry impute environmental agreements {{as an instrument of}} environmental policy a high level of environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. Polluting industries make use of an environmental agreement in order to prevent government intervention by other instruments. Thereby they suppose to have a greater degree of freedom to act. That is the reason why environmental agreements are discussed as an alternative to other instruments of environmental policy. The result of this paper is that environmental agreements offer no advantages in comparison to other instruments of environmental policy: The problem of free-riding and the mostly unregulated abatement effort among the firms lead to low environmental effectiveness and economic inefficiency. Combining an environmental agreement with a tradable permit system or a tax in a ‘policy mix’ can limit free-riding and inefficiency. It may lead to increasing <b>administrative</b> costs, lost <b>flexibility</b> and no time saving in implementation. emission standards, emission taxes, incentives to innovate...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a relatively}} immature computing paradigm that could significantly benefit users. Cloud computing solutions are often associated with potential benefits such as cost reduction, less <b>administrative</b> hassle, <b>flexibility</b> and scalability. For organisations to realize such potential benefits, cloud computing solutions need to be chosen, implemented, managed and governed {{in a way that}} is secure, compliant with internal and external requirements and indicative of due diligence. This can be a challenge, given the many concerns and risks commonly associated with cloud computing solutions. One cloud computing solution that is being widely adopted around the world is cloud-based email. One of the foremost adopters of this cloud computing solution is higher education institutions. These higher education institutions stand to benefit greatly from using such services. Cloud-based email can be provisioned to staff and students at these institutions for free. Additionally, cloud service providers (CSPs) are able to provide a better email service than some higher education institutions would be able to provide if they were required to do so in-house. CSPs often provide larger inboxes and many extra services with cloud-based email. Cloud-based email is, therefore, clearly an example of a cloud computing solution that has the potential to benefit organisations. There are however, risks and challenges associated with the use of this cloud computing solution. Two of these challenges relate to ensuring conformance to internal and external (legal, regulatory and contractual obligations) requirements and to providing a mechanism of assuring that cloud-based email related activities are sound. The lack of structured guidelines for assuring the conformance of cloud-based email is putting this service at risk at higher education institutions in South Africa. This work addresses this problem by promoting a best practice based approach to assuring the conformance of cloud-based email at higher education institutions. To accomplish this, components of applicable standards and best practice guidelines for IT governance, IT assurance and IT conformance are used to construct a framework for assuring the conformance of cloud-based email. The framework is designed and verified using sound design science principles. The utility and value of the framework has been demonstrated at a higher education institution in South Africa. This framework can be used to assist higher education institutions to demonstrate due diligence in assuring that they conform to legal and best practice requirements for the management and governance of cloud-based email. This is a significant contribution in the relatively new field of cloud computing governance...|$|R
40|$|Present {{information}} systems need tools that {{are able to}} register the variety of problems that occur in the system, co-ordinating the efforts of resolution and keeping the experience gained in those efforts. These applications are traditionally called Trouble Ticket Systems (TTS). Basically, a TTS system is expected to operate as "a hospital chart, co-ordinating the work of multiple people who may need to work on the problem" [1]. At the moment there is a great number of tools corresponding to this TTS definition. Since these are usually developed for specific environments, such as project development, hosts administration and helpdesk, they have very specialised information and <b>administrative</b> models, lacking <b>flexibility</b> when applied outside their native domains. Maybe that's why they still can't get satisfactory results in systems and network management (NM), though their good results in other environments. NM environment involves several issues not yet addressed by current systems, namely the heterogeneity of data networks, its geographic dissemination (of the managed system and of the management team), the multiorganisational attribute of wide area networks (with many carriers and communication service providers between network ends), and the decomposition (both functional and hierarchical) of the associated tasks and responsibilities. This paper explains the most important results of a project developed at the University of Coimbra that involved the development of NetTrouble: a TTS designed for NM that brings out new and innovative concepts {{such as the use of}} administrative domains (useful to deal with multi-organisational systems), the autonomic definition of co-operation policies between different organisations, a flexible administrative model (going to ticket-le [...] ...|$|R

In {{the era of}} the vast administrative state there are numerous situations in which some activities are covered by rules emanating from government, departments of state or other governmental agencies. They are like a delegate is invited to stand in the shoes of the legislature. Governmental rules have two-fold nature. Regulations, on the one hand, are sources of law similar to primary legislation. On the other hand, secondary rules are administrative instruments that supplement the executive power, that is, they are an inherent feature of public authority. The twofold nature affects the legality review. Secondary rules may not be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. Although regulations are legislative instruments, their administrative set-up {{plays a key role in}} the application of procedural rules. Indeed, the judicial review of secondary rules is up to administrative courts, which can intervene mainly after a regulation is challenged. Because of this <b>flexibility,</b> <b>administrative</b> judicial proceedings are suitable for challenging regulations on account of the hybrid nature of regulations, which are halfway between legislative instruments and tools inherent in the exercise of public authority. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how administrative law courts seized with the review of regulations. The judicial review by administrative courts appears to be quite similar to that of the Constitutional Court, as it is modeled after an objective approach to jurisdiction. Judges must disapply regulations that infringe laws and they can adjust themselves to and admit of innovative approaches...|$|R
30|$|In fog computing, cloud {{resources}} such as compute and storage etc. are migrating {{to the edge of}} the network where routers themselves may become the virtualized infrastructure [8] and services can be hosted at end devices such as set-top-boxes or access points [49]. In addition, multiple heterogeneous decentralized and ubiquitous devices communicate and cooperate with each other and can perform processing and storage tasks using network without the interference of third-parties [8]. It provides highly virtualized platform that offers storage, computing and networking services between the main cloud data centers and end devices [9]. It supports multiple services and applications where low latency is required. Fog/ edge nodes have sufficient computing power to facilitate user’s task that are received from their end devices. This edge computing concept is introduced within cloud to reduce end-to-end response time between multiple devices. Although cloud computing provides lot of benefits to users in terms of cost reduction, system <b>administrative</b> tasks eliminations, <b>flexibility</b> increase, and improve reliability etc. but it also suffers some limitations including unpredictable network latencies and security issues etc. To overcome these limitations, fog computing is introduced where cloud system is located at the edge of network [57]. Fog computing will be helpful for emerging network paradigm which requires faster processing with less delay [57]. It is able to provide high quality streaming to mobile users through access points or proxies [53]. It is suitable for video streaming, gaming and augmented reality where low latency is required [53]. Fog computing not only reduces latency but also improves the QoS [51]. In fog computing paradigm, data is distributed and moved closer to the end-user and also support for data streaming and mobile computing [52]. Fog is considered to address services and applications that not well fit in cloud, e.g. video conferencing and gaming applications that need predictable and low latency, fast mobile applications, smart grid and smart traffic light system etc. [54]. In short, the aim of fog computing is to place cloud resources, close to mobile users [55]. A FSDN is proposed in [58], which combines the Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Fog computing.|$|R

40|$|For {{over ten}} years now, {{supervision}} and implementation of public purchasing activities in China has largely been divided among government agencies that jealously guard their share of their regulatory pie and covet the regulatory province of other agencies. Yet vested interests {{are now on the}} defensive, as a reform process seeks to collapse the segregated regulatory regimes into a more centralized governance structure. The idea is to combine construction tendering and bidding, government procurement, public land-use auctions and public asset exchanges under one management structure called the “Public Resources Exchange Center. ” Hence, some refer to the reforms as the “four into one platform. ” This reform challenge seeks to reorder China’s public procurement regulatory system, and the reforms have already gained traction in local government experiments. More recently, pushed nationally by anti-corruption departments, the reforms are gaining some attention at China’s central government level. This article offers a description and analysis of the current governance structure for most Chinese public procurement and the reforms underway, identifying some issues implicated by with the reforms.

40|$|The {{rules that}} should govern {{political}} campaign intervention by social welfare organizations {{exempt from taxation}} under § 501 (c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code {{have been the subject}} of recent controversy. Long before all the attention, a group of dedicated and experienced experts on the topic, under the auspices of two wellknown nonprofit groups, undertook the task of clarifying the rules regarding tax-exempt political activity. In light of the issues becoming national news, the group, known as the Bright Lines Project, also converted the regulatory proposal into legislative language. These two versions of the same rules—as a set of regulations and as a set of statutes—provide a natural laboratory to compare the administrative law implications of choosing between legislation and regulation to establish a set of tax rules. This Article undertakes that examination. It concludes that, if revenue rulings interpreting regulations are afforded deference under Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock 2 ̆ 6 Sand Co., promulgating the initial definition of political campaign intervention as a set of regulations may well give the Internal Revenue Service greater power to police political campaign intervention by exempt organizations than would the enactment of detailed legislation. It recommends, however, that broad statutory guidance, followed by regulations, and then by revenue rulings strike the best balance between democratic concerns and <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|Other {{reports have}} {{examined}} regulatory and financial barriers to development of suburban affordable housing, though few have approached the topic {{from the perspective}} of the community developer. In partnership with the Metropolitan Consortium of Community Developers (MCCD), this report uses this lens to examine regulatory and financial barriers that currently exist within suburban communities throughout the Twin Cities metropolitan area. This study will demonstrate the need for greater <b>administrative</b> and procedural <b>flexibility</b> within municipalities, in tandem with community support, in order to make progress on suburban affordable housing development. Case studies were conducted within eight first- and second-ring suburbs within the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Of the eight cities in this report, half are considered model cities, which use some combination of regulatory flexibility, financial commitment, and community support to successfully develop affordable housing in their community. The additional four cities are considered support cities, who have a proven record of commitment to affordable housing, but may consider implementing additional tools to increase production in the future. Municipalities were chosen based on which were best equipped to implement best practices, generate political and community support, and feasibly support development, as determined by availability and track-record of a commitment of public resources. Building off the Minnesota Challenge’s Cost Containment Report and a 2009 Center for Urban and Regional Affairs-sponsored student capstone project entitled, “A Vision for the Next Decade: Planning for Affordable Housing in the Twin Cities Metro”, this report attempts to create a framework for understanding the various factors that help or hinder suburban cities’ ability to develop affordable housing. Using this framework, the report documents current regulatory and financial barriers as well as barriers to community support in eight municipalities within the metropolitan area. To summarize the case studies, matrices documenting regulatory, financial, and community support practices of each study city have also been included. In an effort comprehensively understand the climate of suburban affordable housing throughout the region, case studies will reflect Kingdon’s three stream approach by attempting to synthesize the problems and opportunities of each community, while analyzing policies and community support regarding affordable housing. Each case study begins with a brief summary of findings, followed by a more descriptive narrative, and ends with lessons learned and recommendations for further improvement to enhance already ongoing efforts.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} health practitioners’ {{understanding and}} practice behaviours {{with regards to}} clinical prediction rules (CPRs) and explore their perceptions of adopting a new whiplash CPR. Design: Qualitative study using six semistructured focus groups. Setting: Primary and secondary care in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Participants: Physiotherapists (n= 19), chiropractors (n= 6) and osteopaths (n= 3) were purposively sampled to include health practitioners who provide routine treatment to people with whiplash-associated disorders. Methods: Focus group discussions (n= 6) were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Health practitioners’ understanding and use of CPRs were mixed. Clinicians considered components relating to acceptability (‘whether I agree with it’) and implementation (‘how I'll use it’) when deciding on whether to adopt a new CPR. Acceptability was informed by four themes: knowledge and understanding, CPR type, congruence and weighted value. Consideration of matters that promote implementation occurred once a CPR was deemed to be acceptable. Three themes were identified as potentially enhancing whiplash CPR implementation: {{the presence of an}} external driver of adoption, flexibility in how the CPR could be administered and guidance regarding communication of CPR output to patients. Conclusions: Education on CPR purpose and fit with practice is needed to enhance the perceived acceptability of CPRs. Strategies that facilitate practitioner motivation, enable <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility</b> and assist clinicians in communicating the results of the whiplash CPR could promote adoption of the whiplash CPR.

To {{work with this}} challenge Sweden has introduced a concept of Action Plans, which focus on the recovery {{of one or more}} species; while keeping in mind the philosophy of addressing ecosystems in a more comprehensive way, following the umbrella concept. In this paper we investigate the implementationprocess of the ActionPlanfor one umbrella species, the White-backed Woodpecker (WBW) Dendrocopos leucotos. We describe the plan's organisation and goals, and investigate its implementation and accomplishment of particular targets, based on interviewing and surveying the key actors. The achievement of the targets in 2005 - 2008 was on average much lower than planned, explained partially by the lack of knowledge/data, experienced workers, and <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Surprisingly, the perceived importance of particular conservation measures, the investment priority accorded to them, the money available and various practical obstacles all failed to kg? explain the target levels achieved. However qualitative data from both the interviews and the survey highlight possible implementation obstacles: competing interests with other conservation actions and the level of engagement of particular implementing actors. Therefore we suggest that for successful implementation of recovery plans, there is aneed for initial and inclusive scoping prior to embarking on the plan, where not only issues like ecological knowledge and practical resources are considered, but also possible conflicts and synergies with other conservation actions. An adaptive approach with regular review of the conservation process is essential, particularly in the case of such complex action plans as the one for the WBW...|$|E

We investigated the ecological and social outcomes of community-based revegetation projects {{in an urban}} context, using the case study of all CBR groups located within 25 km of the Brisbane CBD which had been funded during 1997 - 2008 by the Australian Government's Natural Heritage Trust program to undertake revegetation works and which were also available for interview (N = 9 groups). First we reviewed the funding allocation within the region. Second, we conducted rapid on-ground assessments of vegetation outcomes at 10 project sites several years after works were completed, which showed that the detectable area of established revegetation averaged 75 % of the area planned, and the achieved revegetation areas varied greatly, both in total and in relation to cost. Third, we undertook thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with key group members, revealing that groups viewed the NHT scheme's short-term funding and lack of <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility</b> as being largely incompatible with both quantitative monitoring (which groups did not prioritise) and longer-term maintenance of sites for successful vegetation establishment. Interactions with local governments were considered important to success, but internally-conflicting policies of local and state governments, together with unforeseen site disturbances, acted to limit the achievement of projects' revegetation goals. Volunteer involvement and motivation were {{an important part of}} groups' activities. Overall, these CBR projects achieved modest short term environmental benefits together with a range of social benefits.

40|$|Legal democracies {{have been}} facing with the {{evolution}} of a system of administrative activity judicial review. Meanwhile the evolving of the Judicial Control over the Public Administration in different countries of civil law systems has produced even in Albania the possibility of a specific judiciary control over the Public Administration in an extended way. The new Albanian Law on Administrative Courts (Law 49 / 2012) provides the power of the Administrative Court of Appeal to judge as a Court of First Instance, in the cases regarding controversies on normative administrative acts. It is a new open door to judge political decision makers, with some implicit consequences on the entire system. Those acts are produced as a further explanation and specification of the Law. Meanwhile they also express the Government Political Direction and Political will. The most important issue which may rise in this case is: How can an Administrative Court judge on the Executive Political Decision? May a Court judge the political will of the Executive? This power, given to the court, if we refer to administrative normative acts produced by public authorities of political nature, is in substance in contrast to the right of exercising political powers. This power to judge the politics should be evaluated case by case, but also some guiding lines should be established. These should be some basic guiding criteria and limits to be followed by the judges in the evaluation of objectives, purposes, aims or proportionality to the situation that has imposed the law. In most of the judiciary systems, the limits of reciprocal control between powers of the state remain a never ending process of practice. It is usual that the law gives to the administration a wide margin of opportunity. The way how executive would use its discretionarily, should be judged in an appropriate way by courts. The limits of court interference in administrative decision making would produce a fair system of judiciary control but may be even an usurpation of government independence of political decision making or <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Internet and {{the more}} recent {{technologies}} such as web services, grid computing, utility computing and peer-to-peer computing have created possibilities for very dynamic collaborations and business transactions where information and computational resources may be accessed and shared among autonomous and administratively independent organisations. In these types of collaborations, {{there is no single}} authority who can define access policies for all the shared resources. More sophisticated mechanisms are needed to enable flexible administration and enforcement of access policies. The challenge is to develop mechanisms that preserve a high level of control on the administration and the enforcement of policies, whilst supporting the required <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility.</b> We introduce two new frameworks to address this issue. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we develop a formal framework and an associated calculus for delegation of administrative authority, within and across organisational boundaries, with possibilities to define various restrictions on their propagation and revocation. The extended version of the framework allows reasoning with named groups of users, objects, and actions, and a specific subsumes relation between these groups. We also extend current discretionary access control models with the concept of ability, as a way of specifying when a user is able to perform an action even though not permitted to do so. This feature allows us to model detective access control (unauthorised accesses are logged for post-validation resulting in recovery and/or punitive actions) in addition to traditional preventative access control (providing mechanisms that guarantee no unauthorised access can take place). Detective access control is useful when prevention is either physically or economically impossible, or simply undesirable for one reason or another. In the second part of the thesis, we develop a formal framework for contractualbased access control to shared resources among independent organisations. We introduce the notion of entitlement in the context of access control models as an access permission supported by an obligation agreed in a contract between the access requester and the resource provider. The framework allows us to represent the obligations in a contract in structured way and to reason about their fulfilments and violations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, Peru has made {{significant}} progress in improving maternal and child health, although health inequities remain in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The epidemiological transition toward noncommunicable diseases poses challenges, as well. Peru’s health system is segmented, and it is comprised of public facilities administered by the decentralized Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud, MOH), the social security system, and the private sector, which accounts for 40 percent of spending. Established 10 years ago in parallel — al though uncoordinated — with the country’s decentralization reforms, the Comprehensive Health Insurance (Seguro Integral de Salud, SIS) has been Peru’s major effort to expand health coverage. The SIS aims to reduce economic barriers through the elimination of user fees for a package of services. Although its budget has been low, the SIS has {{played an important role}} in the reduction of maternal and child mortality. However, the improvements expected to the overall health system have not materialized. Meanwhile, when the decentralization process transferred funds and authority to the regions, it did so in a context of weak management capabilities, and it failed to clearly define the relationship between the national and regional governments. What is needed is a substantial and sustained effort to improve coverage with a comprehensive approach — one that integrates national and regional health priorities but that allows for flexibility within networks and health facilities and establishes clear incentives as a means to achieve desired results. The SIS appears to be the best vehicle through which to achieve this approach, and it would be feasible to incorporate into it the “Health Strategies. ” Indeed, the SIS has the advantages of a broad package and the use of instruments that provide greater <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility,</b> and it has the potential to use incentives. The inequity of basic care demands a special effort to improve the coverage and effectiveness of care in rural areas, where one -quarter of Peru’s population lives. In these areas, it is necessary to integrate SIS efforts with adequate human resource policies. In Lima, where 30 percent of the country’s population lives, the challenge is no longer providing basic care, but rather responding to noncommunicable diseases through promotion, prevention, and early detection. To achieve this, the following strategies are necessary: (a) increased non communicable disease awareness; (b) integrated public health programs that are designed to address all stages of prevalent chronic diseases; and (c) a single purchaser, like the SIS, to procure services from multiple providers. A major effort to strengthen the technical capacity of the MOH should accompany the strategies outlined above. This effort should emphasize a review of health priorities, the design of effective interventions within a fiscally sustainable benefits package, and the introduction of incentives and new payment mechanisms at hospitals and other health facilities...|$|E
40|$|Executive SummaryWater {{planning}} {{is a process}} to allocate and sustainably manage water to meet our future water requirements. Good water plans provide for river health and community needs. Public consultation is integral to an effective water resource planning process. The occurrence of severe water resource management problems throughout many southern regions of Australia has focused recent attention on water planning processes {{as a means of}} balancing competing uses of water, addressing over-allocation of water entitlements and achieving transparency in water decision-making. Water management is thus a key natural resource management challenge; with persistent drought in southern Australia, and climate change predictions for such droughts to increase in frequency, there is unprecedented interest in the management of water resources in northern Australia. Northern jurisdictions are responding to the national agenda for water reform with the roll-out of water plans in regions facing increased water use pressures. The report is part of a broader project TRaCK – the Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge research hub – which aims to develop new approaches to water planning relevant to northern Australia. TRaCK brings together leading tropical river researchers and managers from across Australia to focus on the sustainability of rivers and catchments from Cape York to Broome. The project seeks to understand the place, practice, barriers and enablers to collaborative water planning. The project aims to improve water planning efforts at two levels:• Nationally by developing a tool-kit of good practices to engage industry, Indigenous and rural communities; by setting guidelines   and benchmarks to monitor and evaluate collaboration in water planning; and by establishing procedures that integrate Indigenous values into water planning. •Regionally by assisting water agencies to improve water planning approaches; by helping to minimise conflicts between parties; by providing models and case studies for good collaboration; and by helping stronger, long-term relationships between stakeholders. The project has two phases: firstly, {{a review of the literature}} to develop a conceptual foundation for the project and two retrospective case studies. The purpose of these case studies is to develop an understanding of contemporary water resources planning in north Australian settings. Secondly to conduct two prospective case studies as an action research project. To date there have been very few water plans prepared in northern Australia. The only one in the north-west is the Ord River Water Management Plan. This report reviews the water planning process in the Ord River in Western Australia (WA) undertaken between 1997 and 2006 by the Western Australian Government 1. It pays particular attention to the public participation aspects of this water planning process. The aims of the Ord River case study are to:• describe public participation in the water planning process;• use the Collaborative Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) (see Figure 1);• interpret public participation in the statutory water planning process;• identify barriers and opportunities for collaboration in the water planning process. This report describes the context and process of the water planning process for the Ord River  region as a backdrop to development in the region. It evaluates the water planning process against a series of criteria for the quality of public participation in water planning. This evaluation is used to identify community expectations as well as the barriers and enablers which may support effective collaboration in water planning for Northern Australia. This case study demonstrates the need to consider the role of water planning in the context of the political imperatives of government. In this case study it is acknowledged that the water planning process is just one part of a broader context of water and land-use planning and management activities in the Ord River  region. This broader context is a historically contingent and continually evolving complex planning landscape which is characterised by particular political, economic and social imperatives. These include the:• ongoing development of the Ord River Irrigation System and irrigated agriculture in the Ord River   Irrigation Area;• protracted native title negotiations that involved a consent determination and package of   benefits for Aboriginal traditional owners of estates in the Ord River valley (see Section 2. 4. 2);• resource use agreements between private interests and government (see Section 3. 1. 2);• unique cultural and historical profile of the East Kimberley region and its population. The Ord River agricultural and hydrological project has a long and complex history of development as an unfulfilled modernisation project (Head 1999; Arthur 1997). It looms large in the geographical imagination of Australians: in particular Lake Argyle, with a volume nine times that of Sydney Harbour, is hailed as a modern engineering wonder (Kittel 2005). Many have commented on  the socio-economic and cultural effects of broad scale landscape, land/water use and demographic  change through the development of irrigated agriculture in the Ord River region (see Lane 2003; Lane, 2004; Head 1999; Arthur 1997). These effects include alienation of Indigenous lands, modification of river flows in the Ord River scheme, and the development of a regional population centre at Kununurra. It is more than 30 years since the Western Australian governments first promulgated the vision to irrigate large expanses of land in the Ord River region for agriculture as the Ord River Irrigation  Area (ORIA). To date the vision has only partially been realised. The first stage of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme, known as Ord Stage 1, was completed in 1972 with approximately 15, 000 hectares  of irrigated land under agricultural development (King, Loh et al. 2001). The second part of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme, Ord Stage 2, has a chequered history of delays and has not yet been implemented. The Ord River water plan was the first to be undertaken in Western Australia. At the time planning for the Ord commenced, the Rights in Water and Irrigation (RIWI) Act 1914 did not provide for statutory water planning, although there did exist procedures for water resource planning. The water plan took 10 years to complete culminating in the release of the Ord River  Water Management Plan (ORWMP) in December 2006 (DoW 2006). The Ord River water planning process was protracted for a number of reasons including:• previous water resources developments such as a major dam and proposals for expansion of the   Ord Stage 2 irrigation area;• other government legal commitments particularly those relating to native title;• changing demand for hydro-power to power a nearby diamond mine;• changing policy environment which required information and methodologies concerning environmental   flows and so required more baseline research on the Ord River ecology. The public participation process for the development of the Ord River water management plan itself  was brief, minimal and difficult to extricate from the myriad of other planning and engagement  activities undertaken by the State water agencies during the period. At the commencement of the planning process the RIWI Act had no statutory requirements for community involvement. These were  put in place in 2000 along with a state-wide policy for environmental water provisions. These new requirements highlighted the importance of community involvement as an essential component of planning and management of water. Despite this policy directive the water planning process in the Ord River had several shortcomings. Firstly, the water planning process failed to uphold its stated aims of transparency (WRC 2000 b: 5), inclusiveness and promoting discussion and communication (DoW 2006 : 149) and this compromised the quality of the decision-making processes. Secondly there is limited community awareness of, and hence support for, the outcomes of the allocation planning process undertaken in the Ord. This may  be attributed to several barriers for improved water planning including the:• existing legal agreements that compromised the transparency of water planning;• need to incorporate and account for disparate knowledges;• lack of continuous feedback and engagement of stakeholders;• need to clarify the role of the public in water planning;• inadequate Indigenous participation;• need for a process that is both flexible and resilient to external decision- making. In addition two external processes affected the water agency’s public participation strategy: a parallel community NRM process known as Ord Land and Water (OLW); and the native title negotiations that led to the Ord Final Agreement. During the planning process the requirements for community involvement were ambiguous for the  planners and the community. However the Department actively sought to engage community members in water {{planning is}}sues and activities through both formal and informal mechanisms. Formal mechanisms included public submissions and an established Community Reference Panel. Informal activities were initiated by the Department as a means to complement the information and involvement from the submissions and panel. By taking a flexible approach, agency staff worked to align processes and to create opportunities for alternative modes of participation within the water management planning process for the Ord River. They did this by supporting other initiatives relevant to water use and management in the Ord River region. Through this support, the agency sought to build the capacity of the Ord River community to engage with water use and management issues and activities, including  the development of a water management plan for the Ord River. These informal activities outside of the planning process have been instrumental in creating a platform for future water planning activities. Agency water planners acknowledge the constraints on and complexities of the Ord’s planning processes. They used <b>administrative</b> <b>flexibility</b> and facilitation of community engagement initiatives outside the formal process to create social learning opportunities which are central to collaborative water planning. They also expressed a desire to better incorporate community  knowledge, aspirations and values. Western Australia’s current water management framework remains in flux with its legislation under  review. One of the main areas to be strengthened in the proposed water legislation is the  involvement and participation of stakeholders in the planning process. In light of the lessons from the Ord River experience this report confirms the significance of community engagement  methodologies in water planning in the legislative review. Some areas water managers may wish to  explore include:• Improved communication strategies for diverse interest groups to address their particular   information and learning needs. Developing effective communication approaches with communities,   including Indigenous communities, requires a cross-cultural negotiation of strategies for producing   and disseminating knowledge. • Capacity-building tools to increase community understanding of water planning as well as the   ability to contribute meaningfully to the planning process. • Training and professional development for agency staff and science providers to better   facilitate community collaboration in planning and research. • Specific Indigenous engagement strategies to identify the implications of water plans for   cultural heritage, values and practice and the economic development opportunities provided by water   planning. • Participatory impact assessment methodologies with best-practice scenario projections and   predictive modelling. • Data, knowledge and information systems with the capability to handle multiple epistemological   frameworks. • Decision-support systems for rigorous and transparent trade-off analysis in decision-making...|$|E
