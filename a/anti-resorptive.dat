40|$|We {{evaluated}} the longitudinal effects of <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents (534 treated women vs. 1, 150 untreated) on lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS). TBS was responsive to treatment in women over age 50. The treatment-related increase in TBS {{was less than}} the increase in BMD, {{which is consistent with}} bone texture preservation. INTRODUCTION: In addition to inducing an increase in BMD, <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents also help to preserve bone architecture. TBS, a new gray-level texture measurement, correlates with 3 D parameters of bone micro-architecture independent of BMD. Our objective was to evaluate the longitudinal effects of <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents on lumbar spine BMD and TBS. METHODS: Women (≥ 50  years), from the BMD program database for the province of Manitoba, Canada, who had not received any <b>anti-resorptive</b> drug prior to their initial dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exam were divided into two groups: untreated, those without any <b>anti-resorptive</b> drug over the course of follow-up, and treated, those with a non-estrogen <b>anti-resorptive</b> drug (86  % bisphosphonates, 10  % raloxifene, and 4  % calcitonin). Lumbar spine TBS was calculated for each lumbar spine DXA examination. Changes in TBS and BMD between baseline and follow-up (mean follow-up 3. 7  years), expressed in percentage per year, were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 1, 150 untreated women and 534 treated women met the inclusion criteria. Only a weak correlation was seen between BMD and TBS in either group. Significant intergroup differences in BMD change and TBS change were observed over the course of follow-up (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Similar mean decreases in BMD and TBS (- 0. 36  %/year and - 0. 31  %/year, respectively) were seen for untreated subjects (both p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conversely, treated subjects exhibited a significant mean increase in BMD (+ 1. 86  %/year, p[*]<[*] 0. 002) and TBS (+ 0. 20  %/year, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: TBS is responsive to treatment with non-estrogen <b>anti-resorptive</b> drug therapy in women over age 50. The treatment-related increase in TBS is less than the increase in BMD, which is consistent with bone texture preservation...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the adverse}} events of {{glucocorticoid}} treatment are bone loss and fractures. Despite available, effective preventive measures, many patients receiving or initiating glucocorticoid therapy are not appropriately evaluated and treated for bone health and fracture risk. Populations with, or at risk of, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) to target for {{these measures are}} defined {{on the basis of}} dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy and bone mineral density. That patients with GIOP should be treated as early as possible is generally agreed upon; however, diversity remains in intervention thresholds and management guidelines. The FRAX(®) algorithm provides a 10 -year probability of fracture that can be adjusted according to glucocorticoid dose. There is no evidence that GIOP and postmenopausal osteoporosis respond differently to treatments. Available anti-osteoporotic therapies such as <b>anti-resorptives</b> including bisphosphonates and the bone anabolic agent teriparatide are effective for the management of GIOP. Prevention with calcium and vitamin D supplementation is less effective than specific anti-osteoporotic treatment.

40|$|AbstractAimThis Clinical Guidance {{is aimed}} to help {{practitioners}} assess, diagnose and manage their patients with osteoporosis (OP), using {{the best available}} evidence. MethodsA literature search using PubMed (MEDLINE) and The Cochrane Library identified all relevant articles on OP and its assessment, diagnosis and treatment, from 2011, to update from the 2012 edition. The studies were assessed {{and the level of}} evidence assigned. For each statement, studies with the highest level of evidence were used to frame the recommendation. ResultsThis article summarizes the diagnostic and treatment pathways for postmenopausal and male OP, while addressing the risk-benefit ratio for OP treatment. Recognising the limitation of only depending on bone mineral density in assessing fracture risk, a move to assess 10 year fracture risk using tools such as FRAX, is recommended as a guide to decision-making on when to start treatment. A re-evaluation was done of the position of calcium supplementation and on the importance of vitamin D. There has been concern about the potential adverse effects of the long-term usage of bisphosphonates, which have been discussed fully. Algorithms for the management of postmenopausal and male OP have been updated. ConclusionsAdequate intake of calcium (1000  mg from both diet and supplements) and vitamin D (800  IU) daily remain important adjuncts in the treatment of OP. However, in confirmed OP, pharmacological therapy with <b>anti-resorptives</b> is the mainstay of treatment in both men and postmenopausal women.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Glucocorticoid-induced {{osteoporosis}} (GIOP) is {{the most}} common form of secondary osteoporosis, yet few patients receive proper measures to prevent its development. We retrospectively searched prescription records to determine if patients receiving oral prednisolone were receiving prophylaxis or treatment for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Methods: Patients who were prescribed&# 62; 7. 5 milligrams of prednisolone for 6 months or longer during a 6 -month period were identified through the prescription monitoring system. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the patient records, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were retrieved, when available. Use of oral calcium, vitamin D and <b>anti-resorptives</b> was recorded. Results: One hundred males and 65 females were receiving oral prednisolone for a mean (SD) duration of 40. 4 (29. 9) months in males and 41. 2 (36. 4) months in females. Twenty-one females (12. 7 &#x 0025;) and 5 (3 &#x 0025;) males had bone mineral density measured by DEXA. Of those, 10 (47. 6 &#x 0025;) females and 3 (50 &#x 0025;) males were osteoporotic and 11 (52. 4 &#x 0025;) females and 2 (40 &#x 0025;) males were osteopenic. Calcium and vitamin D were prescribed to the majority of patients (60 &#x 0025; to 80 &#x 0025;), but none were prescribed antiresorptive/anabolic therapy. Conclusions: Patients in this study were neither investigated properly nor treated according to the minimum recommendations for the management of GIOP. Physician awareness about the prevention and treatment of GIOP should be a priority for the local health care system...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{turnover}} markers {{are useful}} in clinical practice as they are inexpensive and they have proven useful for treatment monitoring and identification of poor adherence. BTM cannot be used in individual patients for identifying accelerated bone loss or an increase in fracture risk or in deciding on the optimal therapy. They are useful for monitoring both <b>anti-resorptive</b> and anabolic treatment. Response to these treatments {{can be defined as}} a result that exceeds an absolute target, or by a change greater than the least significant change; if such a response is not present, then poor compliance or secondary osteoporosis are likely causes. A baseline BTM measurement is not always made; in that case, a value of BTM on <b>anti-resorptive</b> treatment that is low or low normal or above the reference interval for anabolic therapy may be taken to indicate a satisfactory response.

40|$|Bone loss in {{the lower}} {{extremities}} and lumbar spine is an established consequence of long-duration human space flight. Astronauts typically lose as much bone mass in the proximal femur in 1 month as postmenopausal women on Earth lose in 1 year. Pharmacological interventions have not been routinely used in space, and countermeasure programs have depended solely upon exercise. However, {{it is clear that}} the osteogenic stimulus from exercise has been inadequate to maintain bone mass, due to insufficient load or duration. Attention has therefore been focused on several pharmacological interventions that have been successful in preventing or attenuating osteoporosis on Earth. <b>Anti-resorptives</b> are the class of drugs most commonly used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, notably alendronate sodium, risedronate sodium, zoledronic acid, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene. There has also been considerable recent interest in anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and teriparatide (rhPTH [1 - 34]). Vitamin D and calcium supplementation have also been used. Recent studies of kindreds with abnormally high bone mineral density have provided insight into the genetic regulation of bone mass. This has led to potential therapeutic interventions based on the LRP 5, Wnt and BMP 2 pathways. Another target is the RANK-L/osteoprotegerin signaling pathway, which influences bone turnover by regulating osteoclast formation and maturation. Trials using such therapies in space are being planned. Among the factors to be considered are dose-response relationships, bone quality, post-use recovery, and combination therapies [...] all of which may have unique characteristics when the drugs are used in space...|$|R
40|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} approaches commonly involve {{the delivery of}} recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMPs). However, there are limitations associated with the currently used carriers, including the need for surgical implantation and the associated increase in infection risk. As an alternative to traditional porous collagen sponge, we have adopted a solution of the injectable sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) as a carrier for rhBMP- 2. The ability to deliver rhBMP- 2 and other agents by injection reduces the infection risk and lesion size whilst in surgery, {{with the potential to}} avoid open surgery altogether in some indications. The primary methodology used for this in vivo study was a C 57 BL 6 /J mouse ectopic bone formation model. Specimens were examined by x-ray, microCT, and histology at 3 weeks. SAIB was delivered non-invasively and produced up to 3 -fold greater bone volume compared to collagen. To further refine and improve upon the formulation, SAIB containing rhBMP- 2 was admixed with candidate compounds including ceramic microparticles, <b>anti-resorptives,</b> and cell signalling inhibitors and further tested in vivo. The formulation combining SAIB/rhBMP- 2, the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA), and hydroxyapatite (HA) microparticles yielded a 10 -fold greater bone volume than SAIB/rhBMP- 2 alone. To investigate the mechanism underlying the synergy between ZA and HA, we used in vitro binding assays and in vivo fluorescent biodistribution studies to demonstrate that ceramic particles could bind and sequester the bisphosphonate. These data show the utility of SAIB as a non-invasive rhBMP delivery system as well as describing an optimised formulation for bone {{tissue engineering}}...|$|R
40|$|Given current {{developments}} in anabolic therapy for bone, we wished {{to document the}} effects of the only currently available anabolic therapy, parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, on the peripheral skeleton of postmenopausal women. We undertook a systematic review of English articles using MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (final update 28 th March 2016). Additional studies were identified through searches of bibliographies. Studies included those comparing PTH peptides with placebo, with anti-osteoporotic treatments and in combination therapies. Participants had to be postmenopausal women and outcomes included areal or volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and measurements of bone microarchitecture at peripheral sites, such as the forearm and tibia. Data were extracted independently and reviewed by EMcC and LMM. Data on study design were also collected for methodological risk of bias assessment. The heterogeneity between studies, regarding the drug dose and duration, and the site measured, prevented grouped meta-analysis. There {{were no significant differences in}} areal BMD between PTH peptides and placebo at peripheral skeletal sites at 12 months. A decrease in aBMD occurred with PTH(1 - 34) (larger dose) and PTH(1 - 84) treatment at 18 months follow-up in comparison to the placebo arms. <b>Anti-resorptives</b> seemed to attenuate losses of aBMD at peripheral sites when compared to PTH peptides monotherapy, likely mediated by lower cortical porosity. Finally, PTH peptides combined with bisphosphonates or denosumab attenuated peripheral BMD losses in comparison to PTH peptide monotherapy, with evidence of increased BMD at ultradistal peripheral sites when PTH(1 - 34) was combined with denosumab or hormone replacement therapy. This summary should act as a reference point for the comparison of new anabolic therapies, specifically in comparison to PTH(1 - 34) ...|$|R
30|$|There are no {{reliable}} parameters indicating {{the success of}} implants in patients with <b>anti-resorptive</b> therapy. The risk of osteonecrosis development has already been described in the chapter referring to the osteonecrosis risk. Two articles mentioned the radiologic finding of a persisting alveolar socket as a marker indicating the osteonecrosis risk [45, 46]. In addition, other radiologic changes in patients with bisphosphonates have been described, such as regional or diffuse osteosclerosis, confluence of cortical and cancellous bone, prominence of the canal of the inferior alveolar nerve, a prominent lamina dura, radiolucences around the apex and cortical disruptions [46].

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes a}} series of studies into bone imaging and healing. One of the main outcomes utilizes non-destructive micro-computed tomography (μCT) based imaging, so the accuracy of this imaging modality is investigated. The results indicate that proper use of filtration can avoid the beam hardening artifacts that are attributed to changes in material thickness and radiodensity. These artifacts can affect bone densitometry, but the effects can be minimized at the expense of image contrast, noise and scan throughput. The subsequent experiments build on this knowledge and use μCT as a modality in broader investigations of bone fracture healing and regeneration of structural bone allografts. An animal model of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a disease which results in a high incidence of bone fractures for the afflicted pediatric patients, is employed in both healing scenarios. OI patients are normally treated with antiresorptive therapies to reduce fracture risk, so the effect of these therapies on the healing of a subsequent fracture is also investigated. The results indicate that these <b>anti-resorptives</b> have a strong affect on fracture healing if they are present in the circulation, but if treatment is stopped at the time of fracture the effect is very minimal. Furthermore, collagen organization in the healing and intact bone are drastically different, resulting in structure biomechanical properties for the healing bone that are markedly improved in comparison to intact OI bone. This collagen matrix serves as the initial conditions in healing of a structural bone allograft, so the final study investigates this healing paradigm. A model of mouse internal fixation was developed to test grafts both with and without mineral because the presence of mineral complicates effects of matrix alterations in bone. In this case, there was variability in the graft healing between animals, between limbs of the same animal, and even within a single limb. The nature of the healing between grafts with and without mineral is quite different, but the chaotic nature of the healing process may indicate that subtleties in matrix alterations are less important than efforts to improve the healing process at all...|$|R

Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation and is a possible therapeutic agent for the restoration of bone mass. The purpose was {{to determine the effects of}} the <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents alone and in combination with intermittent PTH on bone formation in the mandible and a long bone in the aged ovariectomized (Ovx) rat. Female rats were ovariectomized or sham-operated. One year later, groups of Ovx rats were treated with E, CT, or the bisphosphonate, Risedronate (NE). Additional groups of Ovx rats were treated with each of these agents in combination with human PTH for 10 weeks. Estrogen treatment suppressed most indices of bone formation in the humerus and mandible, while NE decreased some indices of formation at the endocortical and endosteal surfaces of the mandible and humerus. Increased double-labeled surface and mineral apposition rates were observed only on the mandibular endosteal surfaces following CT treatment. When the <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents were combined with intermittent PTH, most indices of bone formation at all skeletal sites were substantially greater than those of the untreated Ovx controls as well as the E-, CT-, and NE-treated groups, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: despite {{availability}} of effective treatments for osteoporosis, impact on fracture rates may be suboptimal because of failure {{to adhere to}} recommended <b>anti-resorptive</b> therapy. OBJECTIVE: to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions intended to improve persistence with <b>anti-resorptive</b> therapy for treating women with osteoporosis or osteopenia. The design {{of the study is}} a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. METHODS: included trials were those reporting interventions to improve persistence with or adherence to <b>anti-resorptive</b> treatment compared to a control medication or usual care. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library was supplemented by review of cited literature. Reports were reviewed and data pooled where appropriate. The primary outcome was duration of persistence with medication. RESULTS: six trials met inclusion criteria, including four reporting persistence as an outcome measure indicating a relative reduction in non-persistence of 22 % (pooled relative risk: 0. 78, 95 % confidence interval 0. 65 - 0. 95) for active compared to control interventions. Heterogeneity between the trial effects was present but not significant (I(2) = 47 %, P = 0. 11). Interventions were varied in design, and some measurements of adherence were subject to self-report bias. Two trials included the majority of participants (3386 / 3497), accounting for > 90 % of the weight in the pooled estimate. CONCLUSIONS: trials to date suggest potential for improving persistence with medication taking thus improving treatment outcomes and reducing fracture risk.

Treatment outcomes were monitored by biochemical and radiotracer measurements together with histomorphometry of transiliac biopsies before {{and at the end}} of treatment following double in vivo pre-labelling with demethylchlortetracycline. Indices of whole body bone formation, obtained from the analysis of 85 Sr data, showed substantial increases (P less than 0. 005) for all three indices measured) while biochemical (hydroxyproline) and kinetic measurements of bone resorption showed modest and equivocal changes only. As a result calcium balance improved. Gastrointestinal calcium absorption showed a tendency to improve, while urine calcium decreased; but these changes were statistically not significant except for radiocalcium absorption in the oestrogen treated subgroup. Histomorphometry revealed substantial increases in cancellous bone volume as reported previously with hPTH 1 - 34 given alone. However, iliac (as distinct from whole body) indices related to bone formation and resorption appeared to have returned towards pre-treatment values by the time of the second biopsy under the influence of the <b>anti-resorptive</b> agent given with the hPTH 1 - 34.

30|$|Orthodontic {{movement}} is a micro-trauma to the periodontal ligament associated with a cascade of local periodontal inflammatory cycle [10]. Secondary to orthodontic movement, several local <b>anti-resorptive</b> and pro-resorptive cytokines {{have been observed}} [11 – 13]. Pro-resorptive cytokines such as interleukin (IL)- 1 family (i.e. IL- 1 β), IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 8 and TNF-α. IL- 1 β which directly induce osteoclastogenesis and promote osteoclast function [14, 15]. Similarly, IL- 6 acts synergistically with IL- 1 and TNF-α on osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoclast function [14, 15]. IL- 7 works indirectly through the induction of TNF-α, an important augmenter of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) mediated osteoclastogenesis [16] while IL- 8 enhances RANKL expression [17], both increase osteoclast generation and activates osteoclasts. On the other hand, the anti-resorptive cytokine such as IL- 4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) suppresses osteoclastogenesis and T-cell of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, respectively [18, 19].

Clinically apparent hypocalcaemia is mostly related to high-dose treatment with zoledronate and denosumab in cancer patients Particular caution is mandatory in all malnourished patients and patients with renal failure who are treated for either bone metastases or osteoporosis. To avoid serious hypocalcaemia, pre-treatment calcium and vitamin D status should be assessed and corrected if appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Osteonecrosis of jaws is {{a common}} {{complication}} of parenteral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and recently medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is contributing to {{the growing number of}} similar osteonecrosis cases which involve maxilla and mandible associated with other <b>anti-resorptive</b> and anti-angiogenic therapies. A 70 -year-old male patient with multiple myeloma and discontinued chemotherapy reported with non-healing extraction site for past 1 year. He also complained of pus discharge extraorally for past 3 months. This case report describes the imaging findings of multiple myeloma in mandible and MRONJ...|$|E
30|$|Cytokines were sub-classified {{into two}} main groups: pro-resorptive and <b>anti-resorptive.</b> Pro-resorptive cytokines such as interleukin- 1 {{superfamily}} (i.e. IL- 1 β), IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 8 and TNF, TNF-α and IL- 1 β directly induce osteoclastogenesis and promote osteoclast function [13 – 16]. Similarly, IL- 6 acts synergistically, with IL- 1 and TNF-α, on osteoclastogenesis to promote osteoclast function [13 – 16]. IL- 7 works indirectly through the induction of TNF-α, an important augmenter of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclastogenesis [17], while IL- 8 enhances RANKL expression [18]; both increase osteoclast generation and activate osteoclasts. On the other hand, an anti-resorptive cytokines such as IL- 4 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) suppress osteoclastogenesis and T cell of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis respectively [19, 20]. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is another <b>anti-resorptive</b> cytokine that inhibits bone resorption along with IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13, IL- 18 and IFN-γ [21]. Cementoclasts have similar precursor cells [22] and enzymatic and metabolic properties to an osteoclast [23] {{and share the}} common regulatory mechanism of cellular resorption of mineralized tissues such as bone and dentine [24]. The differentiation and activation of pre-cementoblasts under both physiologic and pathologic OIIRR conditions require the expression of RANKL, osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OPG) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) by the dental cells [25].|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{associated}} with substantially increased fracture risk, particularly hip fracture, which can occur rela-tively early {{in the course of}} PD. Despite this, current national clinical guidelines for PD fail to adequately address fracture risk assessment or the management of bone health. We appraise the evidence supporting bone health management in PD and propose a PD-specific algorithm for the fracture risk assessment and the management of bone health in patients with PD and related movement disorders. The algorithm considers (i) calcium and vitamin D replacement and maintenance, (ii) quantification of prior falls and fractures, (iii) calculation of 10 -year major osteoporotic and hip fracture risks using Qfracture, (iv) application of fracture risk thresholds, which if fracture risk is high (v) prompts <b>anti-resorptive</b> treatment, with or without dual X-ray absorpti-ometry, and if low (vi) prompts re-assessment with FRAX and application of National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG) guidance. A range of <b>anti-resorptive</b> agents are now available to treat osteoporosis; we review their use from the specific perspective of a clinician managing a patient population with PD. In conclusion, our current evidence base supports updating of guidelines globally concerning the management of PD, which presently fail to adequately address bone health...|$|E
