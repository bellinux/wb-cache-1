5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found <b>and</b> <b>addressed.</b> Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{claim that}} the slow {{deployment}} of IPv 6 seen so far is related with the complete decoupling with IPv 4 regarding to routing <b>and</b> <b>addressing.</b> In this paper we propose Integrated Routing <b>and</b> <b>Addressing</b> (InRA), a new solution to allow IPv 6 to integrate with IPv 4 routing <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> in order to decrease management cost during the coexistence period, and speed up IPv 6 deployment. <b>Addressing</b> <b>and</b> routing integration are achieved {{by the use of}} a new address format derived from IPv 4 <b>address</b> assignment, <b>and</b> the use of a new type of encapsulation allowing packets to be forwarded according to the most detailed information known by a router (InRA or IPv 4).
