5|$|Convinced {{that his}} cow was {{responsible}} for his victories, Augvald worshipped it and <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> it by his side. He also believed that the cow's milk provided special strength and vitality. According to some accounts, the cow's name was Audhumla (after Auðumbla), and it wore a golden collar around its neck.|$|E
5|$|Augvald {{had several}} daughters, {{including}} two who notably fought alongside him as so-called shield-maidens, or female warriors. He owned and worshipped a sacred cow, which he <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> with him, believing he owed his victories to the cow {{and the power}} of its milk. Augvald was killed during a battle with his rival Ferking, the native king of western Karmøy, with whom his story is interlinked.|$|E
5|$|Murray Beck {{writes that}} Macdonald's {{political}} appeal to Nova Scotians {{may have been}} even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe's. Like Howe, Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit, wide learning and respect for factual accuracy. Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as a leader who <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> his word.|$|E

50|$|Máelrubai was, after St. Columba, {{perhaps the}} most popular saint of north-west Scotland. At least twenty-one churches are {{dedicated}} to him, and Dean Reeves enumerates about forty forms of his name. His death occurred on 21 April, and in Ireland his feast has <b>always</b> been <b>kept</b> on this day; however, in Scotland (probably owing to the confusion with St. Rufus) it has <b>always</b> been <b>kept</b> on August 27. There are several locations named after Máelrubai such as Loch Maree.|$|R
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Katy {{has been}} hired {{to take care of}} Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy at the door and {{explains}} that the house is <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E

5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and {{went to great lengths}} to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|The close {{similarities}} between Gorgosaurus libratus and Albertosaurus sarcophagus have led many experts to combine them into one genus over the years. Albertosaurus was named first, so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus, which is sometimes considered its junior synonym. William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted {{the distinction of}} the two genera as early as 1922. Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus (as Albertosaurus libratus) by Dale Russell in 1970, and many subsequent authors followed his lead. Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus Albertosaurus. Other experts maintain the two genera as separate. Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims {{there are as many}} anatomical differences between Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus as there are between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> separate. He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska, New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation. Gregory S. Paul has suggested that Gorgosaurus libratus is ancestral to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he <b>always</b> <b>kept</b> a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
