40|$|A simple {{technique}} with antibiotic-impregnated disks {{has been}} developed to demonstrate the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>synergism</b> of penicillins and aminoglycosides against enterococci. The two antibiotic disks are placed on inoculated plates so that the distance between their centers {{is less than the}} sum of the two radii of their previously determined inhibitory zones. After 5 h of incubation, β-lactamase powder is dusted onto the susceptibility plate with a sterile cotton swab. After overnight incubation, the synergistic effect of the antibiotics is demonstrated by a clear area of no growth in between the two disks. There is good correlation between the synergism determined by this procedure and the susceptibility of the organisms to 2 mg of streptomycin per ml.

40|$|Abstract. Ribosome {{research}} has undergone astonishing progress in recent years. Crystal structures have {{shed light on}} the functional properties of the translation machinery and revealed how the ribosome’s striking architecture is ingeniously designed as the framework for its unique capabilities: precise decoding, substrate mediated peptide-bond formation and efficient polymerase activity. New findings include the two concerted elements of tRNA translocation: sideways shift and a ribosomal-navigated rotatory motion; the dynamics of the nascent chain exit tunnel and the shelter formed by the ribosome-bound trigger-factor, which acts as a chaperone to prevent nascent chain aggregation and misfolding. These linkage between these findings and crystal structures of ribosomes with over two dozen antibiotics targeting the ribosome, most of which of a high therapeutical relevance, illuminated various modes of binding and action of these antibiotics; deciphered mechanisms leading to resistance; identified the principles allowing for the discrimination between pathogens and eukaryotes despite the high ribosome conservation; enlightened the basis for <b>antibiotics</b> <b>synergism,</b> namely the conversion of two weakly acting compounds to a powerful antibiotic agent; indicated correlations between antibiotics susceptibility and fitness cost and revealed an novel induced-fit mechanism exploiting ribosomal inherent flexibility for reshape the antibiotic binding pocket by remote interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of brucellosis is still problematic, {{because of high}} rates of treatment failure or relapses. As the microorganism is an intracellular pathogen, treatment requires combined regimens. However, limited existing data on in vitro combinations are avaliable for Brucellae. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the in vitro efficacy of various traditional and new antibiotic combinations against 16 Brucella melitensis strains. The combination effect of antimicrobial agents was evaluated by E-test synergy method to obtain a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. Co-Trimoxazole (SXT) and moxifloxocin (MXF) exhibited the lowest MIC, while Rifampin (RIF) had the highest MIC in the study. Combinations with RIF showed the best synergistic activity (100 % of RIF-tetracycline (TET), and 87. 5 % of RIF-SXT). Synergistic activity was also detected at seven (43. 7 %) of ciprofloxocin (CIP) -SXT, four (25 %) of TET-MXF, and two (12. 5 %) of TET-SXT combinations. The combinations that demonstrated additivity were TET-SXT, CIP-SXT and TET-MXF. Antagonism was observed only with the TET-Streptomycin (STR) combination in three strains (18. 8 %).

Morin, pyrrolidine and quercetin at subinhibitory concentrations had significant effects in biofilm prevention and/or control when applied alone and combined with <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>Synergism</b> between <b>antibiotics</b> and phytochemicals was found especially against biofilms of NorA overexpressing strain S. aureus SA 1199 B. This strain when growing with subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin developed increased tolerance to this antibiotic. However, this was successfully reversed by quinine and morin. In addition, reserpine and quercetin showed significant efflux pump inhibition.

40|$|Aims: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to potentiate the action of standard <b>antibiotics,</b> through <b>synergisms</b> that allow a decrease in their therapeutic doses and ultimately contribute to the reduction of resistances. Methods and Results: Wild mushroom extracts were applied to different multiresistant micro-organisms (Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum betalactamase- producing (ESBL) E. coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), combined with commercial antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazol, levofloxacin). Microdilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The results obtained showed higher synergistic effects against MRSA than against E. coli. Mycena rosea and Fistulina hepatica were the best extracts for synergistic effects against MRSA. The efficiency of Russula delica extract against E. coli 1 (resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfasoxazole) and E. coli 2 (resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin) was higher than that of Leucopaxillus giganteus extract; nevertheless, the latter extract exhibited better synergistic effects against ESBL E. coli. Conclusions: This study shows that, similarly to plants, some mushroom extracts can potentiate the action of antibiotics extensively used in clinical practice for Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, with positive action even against multiresistant bacteria.

40|$|The pneumococcus {{is one of}} {{the most}} prodigious {{producers}} of hydrogen peroxide amongst bacterial pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide production by the pneumococcus has been implicated in <b>antibiotic</b> <b>synergism,</b> competition between other bacterial colonizers of the nasopharynx, and damage to epithelial cells. However, the role during invasive disease has been less clear with mutants defective in hydrogen peroxide production demonstrating both attenuation and heightened invasive disease capacity depending upon strain and serotype background. This work resolves these conflicting observations by demonstrating that the main hydrogen peroxide producing enzyme of the pneumococcus, SpxB, is required for capsule formation in a strain dependent manner. Capsule production by strains harboring capsules with acetylated sugars was dependent upon the presence of spxB while capsule production in serotypes lacking such linkages were not. The spxB mutant had significantly lower steady-state cellular levels of acetyl-CoA, suggesting that loss of capsule arises from dysregulation of this intermediary metabolite. This conclusion is corroborated by deletion of pdhC, which also resulted in lower steady-state acetyl-CoA levels and phenocopied the capsule expression profile of the spxB mutant. Capsule and acetyl-CoA levels were restored in the spxB and lctO (lactate oxidase) double mutant, supporting the connection between central metabolism and capsule formation. Taken together, these data show that the defect in pathogenesis in the spxB mutant is due to a metabolic imbalance that attenuates capsule formation and not to reduced hydrogen peroxide formation...|$|E

Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for 100 strains of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis which were isolated from clinical specimens. Vancomycin inhibited all 100 strains at ≤ 3. 12 μg/ml, whereas clindamycin inhibited only 46 strains at ≤ 12. 5 μg/ml. Methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains were resistant to achievable levels of erythromycin, with 90 strains having a minimum inhibitory concentration of ≥ 3. 12 μg/ml. Of the five cephalosporins and one cephamycin tested, cefamandole was the most active in vitro, inhibiting 97 strains at ≤ 25 μg/ml. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>synergism</b> was examined by a quantitative bacterial time-kill method. Synergism (≥ 102 kill by the combination over the most effective single antibiotic at 24 h) was demonstrated with vancomycin (1. 56 μg/ml) plus cefamandole (6. 25 μg/ml) in 14 of 14 strains, vancomycin plus cephalothin (6. 25 μg/ml) in 14 of 14 strains, vancomycin plus rifampin (0. 008 to 0. 012 μg/ml) in 6 of 12 strains, rifampin plus cefamandole in 9 of 12 strains, and rifampin plus cephalothin in 10 of 12 strains.

With an interaction index of {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 as borderline, synergism was demonstrated against 30 to 40 % of the strains by the fractional inhibitory concentration index and against 50 to 70 % by the fractional bactericidal concentration index. The reproducibility of the index was within +/- 0. 2 for two-thirds of 40 repetitive assays and within +/- 0. 4 to 0. 5 for all of these assays. Similar results were obtained when netilmicin was substituted for gentamicin. The killing curve system for studying <b>antibiotic</b> <b>synergism</b> was standardized to give results comparable to those obtained with the interaction index. This was achieved when one-half of a previously determined minimum bactericidal concentration was used for single drugs and the amount of antibiotic was at least halved again when drugs were used in combination. An initial bacterial concentration of 10 (5) to 10 (6) colony-forming units per ml is recommended. Given these conditions, synergism could be defined as a 2 -log 10 or more decrease in viable count given by both drugs together, as compared with the more active of the pair after 24 h. Prediction of killing curve results could then be obtained with the fractional bactericidal concentration index. When cephalosporins and gentamicin were combined from the start, the beta-lactam antibiotics were less susceptible to inactivation, as demonstrated in time-killing assays. If one of the antibiotics were added after 24 h, synergism was not demonstrable. The results indicate that the new cephalosporins may be advantageously combined with aminoglycosides...|$|E

Here, we studied whether the synergism was restricted to MRSA and if it extended to non-beta-lactam cell wall inhibitors or to other inhibitors of protein synthesis. Three MRSA and two methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains were tested, including an isogenic pair of mecA (-) /mecA (+) S. aureus Newman. The drug interactions were determined by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and population analysis profiles. The antibacterial drugs that we used included beta-lactam (cefepime) and non-beta-lactam cell wall inhibitors (D-cycloserine, fosfomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin), inhibitors of protein synthesis (Q-D, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, linezolid, fusidic acid), and polynucleotide inhibitors (cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin). The addition of each protein inhibitor to cefepime was synergistic (FIC ≤ 0. 5) or additive (FIC[*]>[*] 0. 5 but < 1) against MRSA, but mostly indifferent against MSSA (FIC ≥ 1 but ≤[*] 4). This segregation was not observed after adding cotrimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to cefepime. Population analysis profiles were performed on plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of the cell wall inhibitors plus 0. 25 [*]×[*]minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Q-D. Cefepime combined with Q-D was synergistic against MRSA, but D-cycloserine and glycopeptides were not.

Tigecycline provided new hope {{for the treatment of}} MDR A. baumannii infections, but isolates showing reduced susceptibility have emerged in many countries, further limiting the therapeutic options. Empirical combination therapy has become a common practice to treat patients infected with MDR A. baumannii, in spite of the limited microbiological and clinical evidence supporting its efficacy. Here, the in vitro interaction of tigecycline with seven commonly used anti- Acinetobacter drugs has been assessed. Methods Twenty-two MDR A. baumannii isolates from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and two reference strains for the European clonal lineages I and II (including 3, 15 and 6 isolates that were resistant, intermediate and susceptible to tigecycline, respectively) were tested. Antimicrobial agents were: tigecycline, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem, rifampicin, ampicillin-sulbactam, and colistin. MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. Antibiotic interactions were determined by chequerboard and time-kill assays. Only <b>antibiotic</b> combinations showing <b>synergism</b> or antagonism in both chequerboard and time-kill assays were accepted as authentic synergistic or antagonistic interactions, respectively. Results Considering all antimicrobials in combination with tigecycline, chequerboard analysis showed 5. 9 % synergy, 85. 7 % indifference, and 8. 3 % antagonism. Tigecycline showed synergism with levofloxacin (4 strains; 16. 6 %), amikacin (2 strains; 8. 3 %), imipenem (2 strains; 8. 3 %) and colistin (2 strains; 8. 3 %). Antagonism was observed for the tigecycline/piperacillin-tazobactam combination (8 strains; 33. 3 %). Synergism was detected only among tigecycline non-susceptible strains. Time-kill assays confirmed the synergistic interaction between tigecycline and levofloxacin, amikacin, imipenem and colistin for 5 of 7 selected isolates. No antagonism was confirmed by time-kill assays. Conclusion This study demonstrates the in vitro synergistic activity of tigecycline in combination with colistin, levofloxacin, amikacin and imipenem against five tigecycline non-susceptible A. baumannii strains, opening the way to a more rationale clinical assessment of novel combination therapies to combat infections caused by MDR and pan-resistant A. baumannii. </p...|$|R
