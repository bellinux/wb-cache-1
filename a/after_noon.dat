5|$|Holden {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the 4th Light Horse Brigade as a private. He {{departed}} for Egypt aboard the transport A29 Suevic on 13 June. Serving as a driver first in the Middle East {{and then on the}} Western Front, his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him to volunteer for the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a lieutenant and posted to No.2 Squadron. Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, No.2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> on 2 October, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Michigans keel {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906, {{one day before}} South Carolina. After the initial {{construction}} periods, the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 (respectively). Michigan was {{slightly more than half}} complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of Detroit, and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors. Like its sister ship, South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took place just <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel. His daughter Frederica christened the ship.|$|E
5|$|U-66 {{began her}} seventh {{and what was}} to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she {{departed}} from Emden destined for operations in the North Channel. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or that a combination of destroyers, submarines, and anti-submarine net tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 March, German attacks {{continued}} to push back the remaining units of the 66th Division, now supported by the 1st Cavalry Division {{and a handful of}} tanks. The composite force managed a fighting retreat, with most units avoiding encirclement. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> the remnants of the division were ordered to retreat behind the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, which were preparing fresh defences on the original Green Line {{along the edge of the}} rear zone. The 66th Division retreated through the new defensive line by 4:00 pm, with the aid of the 5th Durham Light Infantry (DLI), which had been temporarily transferred to support them and the 50th Division took over the front line. Over the following days, the divisions of XIX Corps fell back towards the line of the River Somme, where the 66th Division (plus the 5th DLI) took up positions on the west bank of the river around Barleux and Foucaucourt-en-Santerre, west of Peronne. On 24 March, the German army crossed the Somme and the 2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers counter-attacked the bridgeheads without success but continued to hold a line close to the river. Expecting a follow-up attack the next day, 149th Brigade was temporarily attached to 66th Division and both units were slowly pushed back from the banks of the Somme, withdrawing to Assevillers as night fell on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just <b>after</b> <b>noon.</b> From the second {{ball of the}} innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball {{at the other end}} and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In {{contrast}} to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same over when he was on 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.|$|E
5|$|When Sickles {{arrived with}} his III Corps, General Meade {{instructed}} {{him to take}} up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground ("Hazel Grove") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, {{but it was too late}} to do anything about itthe Confederate attack was imminent.|$|E

5|$|In the two {{previous}} days, 9. Panzerdivision had seen little action. It crossed the Meuse early {{on the morning of}} 11 May, but that day was unable to advance quickly over roads congested with the supply trains of the infantry divisions. The armoured division was under orders to link up with the airborne troops as soon as the Peel-Raam Position had been breached by the infantry forces. As the entire Dutch front had dissolved, the conditions were favourable for such an attempt. In this it would not be hindered by the French forces. Because the German 6th Army was threatening its right flank and {{there was no time to}} prepare a defence line, Gamelin ordered the 7th Army to withdraw its left flank. 2e Brigade Légère Mécanique, part of 1e Division Légère Mécanique, which had arrived at Tilburg, retreated to the south. Also, the 25e Division d'Infanterie Motorisée at Breda progressed no further to the north than the river Mark. As the initial order to occupy the Geertruidenberg sector had not been followed upon, the route to the Moerdijk bridges would not be blocked and the German armoured division would not be engaged by its stronger French mechanised counterpart. Reconnaissance elements of the 9th Panzer Division effectively exploited this opportunity: at dawn, north of Tilburg, near Loon op Zand, they surprised Colonel Schmidt and took him prisoner. Dutch troops in the province thereby lost all unified command. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>noon</b> German armoured cars had penetrated thirty kilometres further to the west and made contact with the southern Moerdijk bridgehead, cutting off Fortress Holland from the Allied main force; at 16:45 they reached the bridges themselves. The northern part of that force would not long remain in the region: at 13:35 Gamelin ordered a complete withdrawal to Antwerp of all French troops in North-Brabant, who would now limit themselves to rear-guard actions.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours <b>after</b> <b>noon.</b> His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas <b>after</b> <b>noon,</b> and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd Open Tank Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a reconnaissance patrol clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the railway track between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to reconstitute the 192nd Regiment's 2nd Open Tank Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped Closed Tank Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd Open Tank Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E
