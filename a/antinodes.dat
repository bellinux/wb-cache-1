40|$|A {{hydrophilic}} floating sphere that is denser {{than water}} drifts to an amplitude maximum (<b>antinode)</b> of a surface standing wave. A few identical floaters therefore organize into <b>antinode</b> clusters. However, beyond a transitional {{value of the}} floater concentration ϕ, we observe that the same spheres spontaneously accumulate at the nodal lines, completely inverting the self-organized particle pattern on the wave. From a potential energy estimate we show (i) that at low ϕ <b>antinode</b> clusters are energetically favorable over nodal ones and (ii) how this situation reverses at high ϕ, {{in agreement with the}} experiment.

500|$|A {{household}} {{demonstration of}} this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the <b>antinodes</b> (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed {{on the back of}} the oven, typically 2450MHz), the value of c can be calculated, [...] "often with less than 5% error".|$|E
2500|$|Horizontal wire dipole antennas {{are popular}} {{for use on}} the HF shortwave bands, both for {{transmitting}} and shortwave listening. [...] They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, {{it is essential that}} the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna's high voltage <b>antinodes</b> occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a balun between the (coax) transmission line and the feedpoint.|$|E

40|$|We use angle-resolved photoemission {{spectroscopy}} (ARPES) {{to investigate}} {{the properties of the}} energy gap(s) in optimally doped (Bi,Pb) 2 (Sr,La) 2 CuO 6 +d (Bi 2201). We find that the spectral gap has two components in the superconducting state: a superconducting gap and pseudogap. Significant differences in their momentum and temperature dependence suggest that they represent two separate energy scales. Spectra near the node reveal a sharp peak with a small gap below Tc that closes at Tc. Near the <b>antinode,</b> the spectra are broad with a large energy gap of ~ 40 meV above and below Tc. The spectral shape and gap magnitude around the <b>antinode</b> are almost constant across Tc, which indicates that the pseudogap state coexists with the superconducting state below Tc, and it dominates the character of the spectra around the <b>antinode.</b> We speculate that the pseudogap state competes with the superconductivity by diminishing spectral weight in the antinodal regions, where the magnitude of the superconducting gap is largest.

50|$|An open {{cylinder}} is {{a cylinder}} {{in which both}} ends are open. It resonates at many frequencies or notes. Its lowest resonance (called its fundamental frequency) occurs at the same frequency as a closed tube of half its length. An open tube will resonate {{if there is a}} displacement antinode at each open end. These displacement <b>antinodes</b> are places where there is a maximum movement of air {{in and out of the}} ends of the tube. Displacement <b>antinodes</b> are also pressure nodes. By overblowing an open tube, a note can be obtained that is an octave above the fundamental frequency or note of the tube. For example, if the fundamental note of an open pipe is C1, then overblowing the pipe gives C2, which is an octave above C1.|$|E

For sufficient pumping, the system starts lasing whenever the atom is close to a field <b>antinode.</b> If the field mode eigenfrequency {{is larger than the}} atomic transition frequency, the generated laser light attracts the atom to the field <b>antinode</b> and cools its motion. Using quantum Monte Carlo wave function simulations, we investigate this coupled atom-field dynamics including photon recoil and cavity decay. In the regime of strong coupling, the generated field shows strong nonclassical features like photon antibunching, and the atom is spatially confined and cooled to sub-Doppler temperatures.

40|$|Three closed {{tubes are}} excited by blowing air across the opening {{at one end}} of the tube, as shown in Figure 1. The fundamental, or first harmonic, mode of each tube {{consists}} of one-half loop of a standing wave, with a pressure node, or velocity <b>antinode</b> at the open end and a pressure <b>antinode,</b> or velocity node, at the closed end. Thus the wavelength is longer for the longer tubes and the longer the tube the lower the frequency, as can be easily heard in the video. In the video the loudest tone produced for each tube is the third harmonic, up one octave and a fifth from the fundamental, for which the tube is 3 / 4 of one wavelength long.

5000|$|A Lecher {{line is a}} pair of {{parallel}} uninsulated wires or rods held a precise distance apart. The separation is not critical but should be {{a small fraction of the}} wavelength; it ranges from less than a centimeter to over 10 cm. The length of the wires depends on the wavelength involved; lines used for measurement are generally several wavelengths long. The uniform spacing of the wires makes them a transmission line, conducting radio waves at a constant speed very close to the speed of light. One end of the rods is connected to the source of RF power, such as the output of a radio transmitter. At the other end the rods are connected together with a conductive bar between them. This short circuiting termination reflects the waves. The waves reflected from the short-circuited end interfere with the outgoing waves, creating a sinusoidal standing wave of voltage and current on the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of half a wavelength from the end, with maxima called <b>antinodes</b> located midway between the nodes. [...] Therefore, the wavelength λ can be determined by finding the location of two successive nodes (or <b>antinodes)</b> and measuring the distance between them, and multiplying by two. The frequency f of the waves can be calculated from the wavelength and the speed of the waves, which is the speed of light c:The nodes are much sharper than the <b>antinodes,</b> because the change of voltage with distance along the line is maximum at the nodes, so they are used.|$|E
