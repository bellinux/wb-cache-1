25|$|As {{capital of}} British Punjab, the area {{south of the}} Walled City {{contains}} many British colonial municipal structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the General Post Office, and Lahore Museum.

An interesting point about Lahore's architecture is that unlike the emphasis on functional architecture in the west, much of Lahore's architecture has always been about making a statement <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{had voted}} against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had {{supported}} entry only because {{he believed that the}} Common Market was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.|$|E

25|$|For the {{two years}} {{following}} his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father's office. In 1863 he {{was admitted to the}} bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of his state and his four years as governor, coming {{as they did in the}} latter part of his life, may have had a tendency to obscure for his later contemporaries the fact that he was at least <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else an eminently successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer's work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book The Young Man and the Law revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and served as President of the American Bar Association from 1890-1891. For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director of the American Bar Association's Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its Annual Bulletins editor for general jurisprudence).|$|E

Before the studio sessions, Bloc Party listened to varied musical sources, from composers Philip Glass, György Ligeti, and Krzysztof Penderecki to urban artists Amerie and Missy Elliott.

500|$|Moore has {{expressed}} dismay that [...] "he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, {{as exemplified by}} Watchmen [...] became a genre". He said in 2003 that [...] "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, {{an awful lot of}} the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them". Gibbons said that while readers [...] "were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing", he said in his view the series was [...] "a wonderful celebration of superheroes <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else".|$|E

500|$|A joyous {{procession}} {{passed through}} the streets of London, with Sheppard's cart drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street accompanied by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men. [...] The occasion was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> a celebration of Sheppard's life, attended by crowds of up to 200,000 (one third of London's population). [...] The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a pint of sack. [...] A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn, where his [...] "official" [...] autobiography, published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe, was on sale. Sheppard handed [...] "a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold", perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the [...] "Narrative". His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes, but it condemned him to a slow death by strangulation by the hangman's noose. [...] After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes, his body was cut down. [...] The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed, fearing dissection; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard's friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him. [...] His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of St Martin's-in-the-Fields that evening.|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, Disney officially {{began the}} film's {{marketing}} campaign by releasing a miniature [...] "ant-sized" [...] teaser trailer, a full-sized {{version of the}} same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on Entertainment Weekly, and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter. Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, [...] "It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days." [...] Mendelson {{went on to say that}} [...] "the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good." [...] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, [...] "The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case." [...] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.|$|E

It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing for The Guardian, Simon Parkin {{praised the}} design of Trico and its {{interactions}} with the world and puzzles, adding further emotional investment. He likened Trico to an [...] "abuse survivor" [...] due to being scared and imprisoned {{at the start of}} the game and the thoughtfulness and relationship development of its characters making it [...] "a game, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything,</b> about rehabilitation through kindness and companionship". Chris Carter of Destructoid felt that the detail and realistic behavior of Trico and the boy were [...] "emotive in a way that most developers wouldn't even attempt", potentially being the reason behind the long development, praising the effort put in by Fumito Ueda and the developers nonetheless. US Gamers Jermey Parish believed that Trico as an in-game character with its own apparent volition was revolutionary in character design, and that the emotional relationship between Trico and the boy was something that could only be effectively done with the interactivity of a video game.|$|E
2500|$|The HPD paved a {{new road}} again in 1990 when Mayor Kathy Whitmire {{appointed}} Elizabeth Watson {{as the first}} female chief of police. [...] Elizabeth Watson served from 1990 to 1992 and was followed by Sam Nuchia, who served as police chief from 1992 to 1997. [...] In 1997, Clarence O. Bradford was appointed as chief. [...] In 2002, Bradford was indicted and later acquitted of perjury charges, stemming from an incident in which he allegedly lied under oath about cursing fellow officers. Since late 2007, Bradford was the Democratic nominee for Harris County District Attorney where he will be facing a Republican opponent (either Kelly Siegler or Patricia Lykos; the incumbent, Charles A. 'Chuck' Rosenthal, resigned prior to withdrawing his candidacy due to an e-mail scandal). [...] Bradford faced Patricia Lykos and lost the election; he later campaigned in 2009 for a Houston City Council at-large council seat vacated by Ronald C. Green, who ran for controller. Bradford's city council seat tenure as of 2015 is term limited under the City of Houston charter where he was listed as a viable candidate for Mayor of the City of Houston since the incumbent, Annise Parker, was in her final term. In 2016, Sylvester Turner was elected Houston's mayor after defeating Adrian Garcia, former Houston Police Officer and Harris County Sheriff, and others. It was Garcia, a relatively late entry into the race, who missed out on potential endorsements from multiple police agency officer's unions and associations in Harris County that had already endorsed Turner before Garcia, who was by most accounts a popular and well-respected County Sheriff and community leader, entered the race. Likely, many of these police agency associations, {{as well as other}} major endorsers, such as The Houston Chronicle, who had already declared their support for Turner, would have likely backed Adrian Garcia. This, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else, probably cost Garcia the election. Sylvester Turner became Mayor of Houston in January 2016.|$|E
