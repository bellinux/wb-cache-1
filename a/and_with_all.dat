5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
60|$|As for March Marston, {{he was mad}} now if ever he {{had been}} so in his life! He danced <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the girls, <b>and</b> {{wrestled}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the men, <b>and</b> played hide-and-seek <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the boys, <b>and</b> fraternised <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the old people, and chased all the dogs, and astonished, not to say horrified, all the cats. Yet, although he did all this, he did not neglect the vision in leather, by no manner of means.|$|R

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|The University Police Department {{provides}} 24-hour {{law enforcement}} and security, campus escort service, motorist assistance, educational programs, and crime prevention information for the BGSU campus and surrounding areas. The department is staffed by 24 full-time, state-certified police officers granted full police authority by the Ohio Revised Code. In addition to the officers, the department includes a student safety services staff that provides services for the university community, such as crowd control and the campus escort service. The department deploys uniformed officers to patrol the campus in marked police cars, bicycles, and on foot and has a mutual aid agreement with the Bowling Green City Police <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> other state university police departments in Ohio.|$|E

25|$|Though {{there are}} many methods {{available}} to wildlife managers at airports, no single method will work in all instances <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> species. Wildlife management in the airport environment can be grouped into two broad categories: non-lethal and lethal. Integration of multiple non-lethal methods with lethal methods results in the most effective airfield wildlife management strategy.|$|E
25|$|One major point often {{omitted from}} the debate (though Costello covers it thoroughly) is the Philippines, where MacArthur, unlike Kimmel or Short, had {{complete}} access to all decrypted Purple and JN-25 traffic CAST could provide (indeed, Stinnet quotes Whitlock to that effect), and was nonetheless caught unprepared <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> planes on the ground nevertheless, nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack.

25|$|With 2:36 left <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> three timeouts, Hostetler and the Giants began driving again.

The Giants called two running plays to get the ball {{to the middle of the}} field, and with four seconds left Bahr was called on to try to win the game. His kick went through the uprights as time ran out and the Giants won 15–13.|$|E

25|$|Work {{was begun}} on the Royal Portal {{with the south}} lintel around 1136 <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> its {{sculpture}} installed up to 1141. Opinions are uncertain as the sizes and styles of the figures vary and some elements, such as the lintel over the right-hand portal, have clearly been cut down to fit the available spaces. The sculpture was originally designed for these portals, but the layouts were changed by successive masters, see careful lithic analysis by John James. Either way, most of the carving follows the exceptionally high standard typical of this period and exercised a strong influence on the subsequent development of gothic portal design.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the Vikings locate {{what they}} believe to be the final Dark Temple. They destroy it, but the {{remnants}} of the Dark Tribe survive, and rally for a final battle. Secure in the knowledge that one more victory is all that is required, the Mayans launch an attack. They prove victorious, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the Dark Tribe's temples and farms eradicated, and no way of breeding new troops, Morbus retreats to his lair. Begging HE for mercy, Morbus is horrified to see vines infesting the building, quickly wrapping themselves around him, and turning him to stone.|$|E

For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars. This is too much for Arthur, who is unable to face the prospect of serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, and upon his imprisonment he suffers a mental breakdown and refuses any contact with his family.|$|E

25|$|By then, Serbia {{had only}} one airline carrier, Jat Airways shareholding, a company with its own statute, Board of Directors and {{management}} bodies. Air Serbia {{is the result of}} a strategic partnership agreement between the Etihad Airways and Jat Airways, making the company to fulfill regulatory requirements, and got registered with the Business Registers Agency (APR). Subsequently, Jat Airways changed its name to Air Serbia and everything else was kept unchanged, continuing to be a joint stock company, the commercial entity registered in the APR, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the rights and obligations of Jat Airways. At that moment, Jat Airways was working at full power and fulfilling the obligations of regular and charted passenger transportation, as agreed in its business plan for 2013.|$|E
25|$|After just 100 {{hours of}} ground combat, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of Kuwait {{and much of}} {{southern}} Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; {{there is little doubt}} that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.|$|E
25|$|These recount how Enoch {{was taken}} up to Heaven and was {{appointed}} guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on God's throne. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries <b>and,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord whatever {{comes out of the}} mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3rd Book of Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbala of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees.|$|E
