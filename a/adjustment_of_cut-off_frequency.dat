Many authors have modeled cMUT arrays but only few works have been dedicated to the simulation of devices working in real configuration, i. e. where each element is made of {{a finite number of}} cMUTs. In previous studies, we pointed out that, in such conditions, interactions between cMUTs could cause some strong <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the useful frequency bandwidth, leading to undesirable oscillations {{at the end of the}} impulse response.

The separation of scales enables the use of the method of multiple scale expansions for periodic structures, a powerful upscaling technique from the heterogeneity scale to the wavelength scale. However, the results remain valid for non-periodic composite materials which show a Representative Elementary Volume (REV). The paper extends the previous investigations to three-component composite materials made of hard inclusions, coated with a soft material, both of arbitrary geometry, and embedded in a connected stiff material. The equivalent macroscopic models are rigorously established as well as their domains of validity. Provided that the stiffness contrast within the soft and the connected stiff materials is of the order of the squared separation of scales parameter, it is demonstrated (i) that the propagation of long wave may coincide with the resonance frequencies of the hard inclusions/soft material system and (ii) that the macroscopic model presents a series <b>of</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> given by an eigenvalue problem for the resonating domain in the cell.
