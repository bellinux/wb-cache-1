5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>advantage,</b> but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>advantage,</b> but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

30|$|Based on this, {{the input}} {{structure}} of hydrogen production was estimated. First, total cost {{is divided into}} direct expenses such as methane for materials and other indirect expenses. The former is estimated from Table  9, and the latter is introduced by referring to the input structure of the headquarters sector {{as in the case}} of FCV in 4.1. Finally, we summed up both and fixed them as sectoral inputs for hydrogen production. The main difference in the input structure of both technologies is the amount of methane used as the raw material and source of heat. Direct decomposition of methane needs approximately double the methane input as in the methane steam reforming method. However, the former has <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>advantage</b> when CO 2 emissions are lower than the latter. The presence or absence of a transport margin also depends on whether production is on-site or off-site.|$|R

40|$|We study nonclassical {{correlations}} beyond entanglement in {{a family}} of two-mode non-Gaussian states which represent the continuous-variable counterpart of two-qubit Werner states. We evaluate quantum discord and other quantumness measures obtaining exact analytical results in special instances, and upper and lower bounds in the general case. Non-Gaussian measurements such as photon counting are in general necessary to solve the optimization in the definition of quantum discord, whereas Gaussian measurements are strictly suboptimal for the considered states. The gap between Gaussian and optimal non-Gaussian conditional entropy is found to be proportional to a measure of non-Gaussianity in the regime of low squeezing, for a subclass of continuous-variable Werner states. We further study an example of a non-Gaussian state which is positive under partial transposition, and whose nonclassical correlations stay finite and small even for infinite squeezing. Our results pave the way to a systematic exploration of the interplay between nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity in continuous-variable systems, in order to gain a deeper understanding of -and to draw <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>advantage</b> from- these two important resources for quantum technology.

The aim {{of the work is}} to carry out a survey of the present situation, to find about the pupils' level of business language and also to discover what their attitude to the practice enterprise and their motivation to study foreign languages are. By focussing the language instruction on working life, we want to enhance their competitiveness on the labour market. Quantitative research methods are combined here with qualitative ones. Concerning the tools of research, we used didactic test, questionnaire, interview and focus group. We have found out that the practice enterprise has a positive influence on students' level of foreign languages. However, no connection between practice enterprise and pupils' attitude to foreign languages and their motivation to study them has been proved. In order to take <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>advantage</b> of the potential of practice enterprise as a means to acquire foreign languages, we recommend <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> and <b>a</b> more systematic integration of language instruction into [...] ...|$|R

6000|$|A {{little while}} ago Willum Lang, a postman's empty letter-bag on his back, and a {{glittering}} drop trembling from his nose, picked {{his way through the}} puddles, his lips pursed into a portentous frown, and his grey head bowed professionally in contemplation of a pair of knock-knee'd but serviceable shanks. A noteworthy man Willum, son of Simon, son of David, grandson by marriage of Joseph Paisley, all famous [...] "blacksmiths" [...] of Gretna Green. For nigh a century Springfield has marked time by the Langs, and still finds [...] "In David Lang's days" [...] as forcible as [...] "when Plancus was consul." [...] Willum's predecessors in office reserved themselves for carriage runaways, and would shake the lids from their coffins if they knew that Willum had to marry the once despised [...] "pedestrians." [...] "Even Elliot," [...] David Lang would say, [...] "could join couples who came on foot," [...] and that, of course, was very hard on the poor pedestrian, for greater contempt no man ever had for rival than David for Elliot, unless, indeed, it was Elliot's for David. But those were the great clattering days, when there were four famous marrying shops: the two rival inns of Springfield, that washed their hands of each other across the street, Mr. Linton's aristocratic quarters at Gretna Hall, and the toll-bar {{on the right side of}} the Sark. A gentleman who had requisitioned the services of the toll-keeper many years ago recently made a journey across the border to shake his fist at the bar, and no one in Gretna Green can at all guess why. Far-seeing Murray, the sometime priest of Gretna Hall, informed me, succeeded Beattie at the toll-house in 1843, and mighty convenient friends in need they both proved for the couples who dashed across the border with foaming fathers at their coaches' wheels. The stone bridge flashed fire to rushing hoofs, the exulting pursuers, knowing that a half-mile brae still barred the way to Springfield, saw themselves tearing romantic maidens from adventurers' arms, when Beattie's lamp gleamed in the night, the horses stopped as if an invisible sword had cleft them in twain, the maid was whisked like a bundle of stolen goods into the toll-bar, and her father flung himself in at the door in time to be introduced to his son-in-law. Oh, Beattie knew how to do his work expeditiously, and fat he waxed on the proceeds. In his later days marrying became the passion of his life, and he never saw a man and a maid together without creeping up behind them and beginning the marriage service. In Springfield there still are men and women who have fled from him for their celibacy, marriage in Scotland being such an easy matter that you never know when they may not have you. In joining couples for the mere pleasure of the thing, Simon brought high fees into disrepute, and was no favorite with the rest of the priesthood. That half-mile nearer the border, Jardine admits, gave the toll-bar <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>advantage,</b> but for runaways who could risk another ten minutes, Gretna Hall was the place to be married at.|$|E

Increasing of fuel consumption cuased more pollutant formation and resources depletion. In this project flameless combustion has been investigated as a reliable solution to this problem. Many studies has been carried out on different setup of flameless burners. In this thesis a new setup has been studied that is tangential fuel-oxidizer arrangement of inlets. This study shows that changing in the arrangement of inlets from co-axial to tangential will increase the efficiency of the lab scale combustor upto 14 % and caused reduction of emissions and in particular NOx formation upto 55 %. Also it has been concluded that the maximum temperature of flameless combustion in this new setting is higher by about 12 %. Additionally this maximum temperature occurs near the wall of the combustor despite of co-axial flow which its highest temperature occurs at the center line. This phenomena helps improving of combustion efficiency.
