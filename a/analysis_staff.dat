40|$|Thesis (Ph.

This analysis indicates how current administrative staffing levels are influenced by student enrollment, school size, student poverty, and district size. The interviews were the basis for grounding a theory to describe how human resources are allocated to schools and how principals invest those resources. The emergent Proactive-Reactive Relationship Resource Theory frames how principals invest in relationships to both mitigate the magnitude of emergent managerial work and create resources through relationship capital to support school administrative work demands.

50|$|Accidents {{are prone}} to happen in any human undertaking, but {{accidents}} occurring within the healthcare system seem more salient and severe due to their {{profound effect on the}} lives of those involved, sometimes resulting in the death of a patient. In the healthcare system, {{there are a number of}} methods in which specific cases where accidents happened are reviewed by others who already know the outcome of the case. These methods include morbidity and mortality conferences, autopsies, case analysis, medical malpractice claims <b>analysis,</b> <b>staff</b> interviews, and even patient observation. Hindsight bias has been shown to cause difficulties in measuring errors in these cases. Many of these errors are considered preventable after the fact, clearly indicating the presence and importance of a hindsight bias in this field. There are two sides of debate in how these case reviews should be approached to best evaluate past cases: the error elimination strategy and the safety management strategy. The error elimination strategy aims to find the cause of errors, relying heavily on hindsight (therefore more subject to the hindsight bias). The safety management strategy relies less on hindsight (less subject to hindsight bias) and identifies possible constraints during the decision making process of that case. However, it is not immune to error.|$|E
