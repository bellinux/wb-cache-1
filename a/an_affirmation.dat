5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to require <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected.

5|$|In June 1939, Pontecorvo {{applied for}} a visa to visit Sweden, but his {{application}} was rejected. On 23 August came {{the news of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. He joined the French Communist Party the next day as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the British and French declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

5|$|The title {{refers to}} the ancient Indian {{practice}} of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors. It was also <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> to one of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's beliefs about an individual's right to make own choices. The film's English title for international release was mainly One's Own Choice, however it was shown at the Moscow International Film Festival under the title, On Own Will. Other translations of the Malayalam title have also been used, such as By Choice, Her Own Choice, Marriage by Choice, Betrothal by Choice, The Betrothal, and The Selection.|$|E
5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{regions of}} the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media {{and the opening of}} the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices – the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South – but became <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England – especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East – has a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.|$|E

25|$|Schopenhauer {{discusses}} suicide at length, {{noting that}} it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged.

The depiction of the nocturnal and predatory owls, however, have led many to believe the relief is <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of Lilith’s role as a demon who flies about the underworld, delivering night terrors to those who sleep.|$|E

25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} natural rights becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E
25|$|Afrocentrism {{can be seen}} as an African-American-inspired {{ideology}} that manifests <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to the African continent). It often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern and Asian cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa. It involves an African diaspora version of an African-centered view of history and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana State troopers and National Guard {{assisted}} with crowd {{control for the}} first time since 1979. Many of the floats had been partially submerged in the floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats. Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly impacted by the storm, and many had lost most or all of their possessions, but their enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense than usual and celebrated as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city, with references to MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and local and national politicians.|$|E

25|$|Practitioners {{traditionally}} {{believe that}} daily life depends on proper alignment {{and knowledge of}} one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean {{a portion of the}} soul that determines personal destiny and success. Ashe is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. Ashe is the power to make things happen. It is <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ashe through iwa-pele or gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger Orisha. For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the Orishas, and the ancestors.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{original}} documents to support Maria Pia's {{claims to be}} both a daughter of Carlos I and an heir to the Dukedom of Braganca and pretense to the throne of Portugal. Maria Pia's baptismal certificate from 1907 was destroyed and {{there is only a}} copy of the document in which Carlos I supposedly granted succession rights to Maria Pia. Nonetheless, there exist some records concerning a relationship between Maria Pia's mother Maria Amelia Laredó e Murça and King Carlos I. A biography of Infanta Eulalia of Spain purports to reveal some letters of the Portuguese King and also reveals the existence of Maria Pia de Bragança as King Carlos I's bastard daughter. King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia seem to have had an ongoing friendship with Maria Pia; her supporters have interpreted this relationship as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> on the part of Alfonso and Jaime de Borbón that they recognised Maria Pia de Bragança as Carlos's bastard daughter. In fact, most of the letters cited by Maria Pia in support of her claim were simply courteous replies by royals to her numerous queries and salutations.|$|E
25|$|At Corte {{and having}} gained notoriety for his {{academic}} work and intelligence, Stockler {{managed to be}} appointed by D. John VI (12 November 1819) to replace the former-Captain-General, who had fallen in disgrace. Stockler left for Lisbon in August 1820, {{with the intention of}} receiving from the Regency the orders necessary to govern the Azores. It was during this time that a constitutional movement was taking form on the continent, resulting in the 1820 Revolution when Stockler arrived in Lisbon. Obviously anti-Liberal, his Jacobist fame and French collaboration during the French invasion helped him to obtain <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> by the Liberal revolutionaries for his position, permitting his departure for the islands. He arrived on 18 October 1820 and was received by a fervor, owing to his replacing the unpopular Araújo e Azevedo. Both political groups in the Azores were hopeful for his tenure: the Liberals, expected a confirmation of the Pro-Constitutional ideas, and the Absolutists, convinced that his nomination by King D. John VI before the revolution, would guarantee his support for the dominance of the monarchy. The Absolutists were immediately vindicated when Stockler prohibited political contact with Portugal and requested new members of the administration and judiciary from Rio de Janeiro, ignoring the legitimacy and authority of Lisbon institutions.|$|E
