50|$|An <b>Adaptation</b> <b>kit</b> upgrade (AKU or <b>Adaptation</b> <b>kit</b> update) {{is a way}} of {{updating}} Microsoft's Windows Mobile.|$|E
50|$|The design {{consists}} of the M298 Cannon, M191 Bipod, M9 Baseplate, and the Carrier <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Kit.</b> With {{the use of an}} auxiliary M9 Baseplate and extension feet for the M191 Bipod, the M121 can be dismounted from the vehicle and emplaced for ground-mounted operations.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, as patents on the {{technology}} expired, tractor and implement manufacturers {{agreed on the}} three-point hitch as the one standard, interchangeable, full-featured system to hitch implements to tractors. With the advent of nonproprietary status, the manufacturers were able to refine the system and create useful modifications. Now, nearly all manufacturers have adopted some standardised form of the modern three-point hitch system; many companies also offer safe <b>adaptation</b> <b>kits</b> for converting the non-standard hitch systems to the three-point hitch system.|$|R
40|$|Evidence-based {{interventions}} (EBIs) {{are effective}} in preventing ado-lescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections; however, prevention practitioners are challenged when selecting and adapting the most appropriate programs. While there are existing adaptation frameworks, there is little practical guidance in applying research in the field. To address this need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health initiated the Adaptation Guidance Project. The project included {{the development of a}} comprehensive adaptation guidance framework and <b>adaptation</b> <b>kits</b> for select evidence-based teen pregnancy and HIV prevention programs. In addition, three innovative concepts emerged that have application to other adaptation program and evaluation efforts, including moving research into practice. First, the authors defined the core components of an EBI in three distinct ways: core content, core pedagogy, and core implementation. Second, they piloted a practitioner-friendly adaptation guidance-messaging schema-Green, Yellow, and Red Light Adaptations, and last they included fidelity/adaptation monitoring logs. This article will describe the process used to develop the <b>adaptation</b> guidance <b>kits,</b> including the main features and tools.

50|$|Due to the {{relative}} ease of porting and the open source license, Sailfish OS has also been unofficially ported to other 3rd-party devices. The Hardware <b>Adaptation</b> Development <b>Kit</b> for porters has been published and is free. There are about 50 active portings in progress which follow official Mer standards, and they are listed below ordered by the device's retail name. Due to license restrictions, this doesn't include proprietary parts or extensions such as the Alien Dalvik compatibility layer for Android apps. However it can be added, e.g. when a manufacturer or distributor turns it from the community version into an officially supported version for a particular device.|$|R
50|$|Official ROM updates are or were {{available}} for several versions of the Wizard, including the Cingular 8125 (AKU 2.2.0), the Dopod 838, the i-mate K-Jam (AKU 2.0.0), the O2 XDA Mini S (AKU 2.0.0), the Qtek 9100 (AKU 2.0.0), the T-Mobile MDA US (AKU 2.3.0), and the T-Mobile MDA Vario. These ROM updates often include a new <b>adaptation</b> <b>kit</b> upgrade which adds features and fixes bugs.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft {{originally}} sold MS-DOS only to {{original equipment}} manufacturers (OEMs). One {{major reason for}} this was that not all early PCs were 100% IBM PC compatible. DOS was structured such {{that there was a}} separation between the system specific device driver code (IO.SYS) and the DOS kernel (MSDOS.SYS). Microsoft provided an OEM <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Kit</b> (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} {{included an}} enhanced battery-saving capability called persistent storage capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued {{the trend of}} Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium {{to the use of}} a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, no distinction between the two is obvious to users). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike prior devices, WM5 devices lose no data if power is lost.New to 5.0, OS updates were released as <b>Adaptation</b> <b>kit</b> upgrades, with AKU 3.5 being the final released.|$|E
40|$|Techniques {{based on}} nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{have proven to}} be essential for the detection and epidemiological tracking of members of the genus Cryptosporidium. This gastrointestinal protozoan parasite cannot be routinely cultivated and it has an extremely low infectious dose, possibly below 100 oocysts. As Cryptosporidium is an important pathogen, particularly in immuno-compromised hosts, there is a pressing need to employ sensitive and discriminatory systems to monitor the organism. A number of fairly standard target genes have been assessed as detection targets, including 18 S rRNA, microsatellites, and heat-shock (stress) proteins. As our knowledge of the biology of the organism increases, and as the full genome information becomes available, the choice of target may change. Genes encoding parasite-specific surface proteins (gp 60, TRAP-C 2, COWP) have already been examined. Much of the effort expended in molecular diagnostics of Cryptosporidium has been directed toward developing robust nucleic acid extraction methods. These are vital in order to recover amplifiable DNA from environments where small numbers of oocysts, often fewer than 100, may exist. Methodology based on <b>adaptation</b> of commercial <b>kits</b> has been developed and successfully employed to recover amplifiable DNA directly from water, food (particularly seafood), and fecal samples...|$|R
