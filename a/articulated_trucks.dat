50|$|A first-person arcade adventure, {{it draws}} {{inspiration}} from the George A. Romero film Dawn of the Dead; the player controlling four protagonists exploring a zombie-filled shopping mall.

If a character's health is depleted, he turns into a zombie, which then roams the room they died in. Zombies can be killed either by numerous body shots, or a single shot to the head. Characters were named after the creators of the game.|$|E

50|$|The road {{may then}} not be {{perceived}} as hazardous when accelerating, cruising or even braking softly. But {{in a case of}} hard (emergency-)braking, the car will start to rotate over the wheelpath offering highest grip. Split friction may cause jack-knifing of <b>articulated</b> <b>trucks,</b> while trucks with towed trailers may experience trailer swing phenomena. Split friction may be caused by an improper road spot repair that results in high variance of texture and colour (thin ice on newly paved black spots thaws faster than ice on old greyish asphalt) across the road section.|$|E
50|$|The road {{transport}} industry grew strongly {{after the war}} and the sophistication and size of trucks increased. By the end of the 1960s, large <b>articulated</b> <b>trucks</b> accounted for 56% of all tonne-kilometres performed by {{road transport}}. By this time waves of takeovers had reorganised the industry with small local firms being taken over by large national transport companies. By 1966 five conglomerates dominated the industry - Ansett, TNT, Mayne Nickless, Brambles and Alltrans/Comet. This rationalisation meant that the union also had to reorganise itself into a strong federal body, capable of operating in a nationally coordinated way.|$|E
50|$|Euro Truck Simulator 2 (commonly {{abbreviated}} as ETS2) is {{a vehicle}} simulation game developed {{and published by}} SCS Software for Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X and was initially released as open development on 19 October 2012.

The player can drive one of a choice of <b>articulated</b> <b>trucks</b> across a depiction of Europe, picking up cargo from various locations and delivering it. As the game progresses, it is possible for the player to buy more vehicles, depots, and hire other drivers to work for them.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effectiveness of the International Roughness Index (IRI) and Heavy <b>Articulated</b> <b>Truck</b> Index (HATI) to identify pavement sections subject to high dynamic wheel loads (DWL). HATI is a profile-based roughness index used by some Australian road agencies to identify road sections providing poor ride quality for heavy trucks. The longitudinal surface profile data of ten pavement sections were used to simulate DWL caused by a typical fully laden <b>articulated</b> <b>truck</b> and to calculate relevant IRI and HATI values. The results of this limited study showed that HATI could be a good indicator of road sections subject to high DWL. For the sections tested herein, it was found to have strong correlation with the Dynamic Aggregate Force Coefficient (DAFC), a measure of road damage due to DWL. The study also included using wavelet analysis to identify and locate the sources of DWL excitation for sections with different HATI values. Wavelet signals of longitudinal profile data in relevant roughness subbands proved to be effective in identifying and locating profile characteristics responsible for exciting truck body motions that induce high DWL. The approach proposed herein would help road agencies to adopt maintenance programs to eliminate or minimise the additional damage and ensure sustainability of their assets’ and mobility of road users...|$|R
50|$|Close to {{the shore}} of the lake is an {{approximately}} one kilometre long tunnel, wide enough to drive an <b>articulated</b> <b>truck</b> into, which was excavated in the 1960s as part of a planned development intended to create a man-made cavern within Camlough Mountain which was to have been used to store and release water to generate electricity. It was planned that the pumped hydro storage scheme, when operational, would generate more than 200 megawatts of electricity had it been completed; however, plans were shelved with the onset of the troubles.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1970s, Faun {{supplied}} tractor trucks for the Soviet Union in {{the framework}} of the so-called Delta project: to develop oilfields in Siberia, build the Baikal-Amur Mainline and realise industrial projects, the Soviet Union need heavy, all-terrain and extremely robust low-bed tractor units. Faun delivered 86 HZ 34.30/41 <b>articulated</b> <b>trucks</b> with V12-Deutz engine and an output of 326HP. Later, the Soviet Union ordered more tractor units by Faun of all frame sizes, from HZ 32.25/40 with a 305-HP-V10 engine to the super-heavy HZ 40.45/45 all-terrain tractor unit with a 456HP V12 Deutz engine. In total, Faun delivered 254 tractor trucks to the USSR, the last in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Articulated</b> <b>trucks</b> towing {{a single}} trailer or two {{trailers}} (commonly known as [...] "short doubles") with {{maximum overall length}} of 19 m {{are referred to as}} [...] "General access heavy vehicles" [...] and are permitted in all areas, including metropolitan. B-doubles are limited to a maximum total weight of 62.5 tonnes and overall length of 25 m, or 26 m if they are fitted with approved FUPS (Front Underrun Protection System) devices. B-doubles may only operate on designated roads, which includes most highways and some major metropolitan roads. B-doubles are very common in all parts of Australia including state capitals and on major routes they outnumber single trailer configurations.|$|E
