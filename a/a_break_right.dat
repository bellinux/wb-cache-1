50|$|The World Strongman Challenge (WMPC) {{first took}} place in 1987. It was a third major strongman {{competition}} with the previously established World's Strongest Man and World Muscle Power Classic having made the popularity of strongman competitions a huge success. The WSC in fact helped fill a void left in 1987 {{by the absence of}} the World's Strongest Man event and it may have even been introduced for these purpose. The event immediately attracted the very best athletes in the field and the final placings in that inaugural 1987 competition saw both Jón Páll Sigmarsson and Geoff Capes on the podium. In 1988, despite the reintroduction of WSM, the WSC continued and unlike many other strongman events of the era, the WSC managed to continue without <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>right</b> up until 1998, at no point dipping in the quality of the athletes competing.|$|E
3000|$|... 23 Persons are {{assigned}} to the HOPE treatment group if they were born in Georgia and were age 18 in 1993 or later. Regression controls include dummies for year age 18, survey year, age, birth state, sex, race, and ethnicity. The control group includes persons born in states not adopting a merit aid program prior to 1998. We estimate the effects for 4 -year, 5 -year, and 6 -year policy windows; an X-Year Window means that cohorts included were age 18 X years {{before or after the}} policy was adopted. Including cohorts that are very far from the policy adoption weakens the identification since DD assumes <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>right</b> at policy adoption; using a 7 - or 8 -year window produces results similar to the 6 -year window. However, examining a less than 4 -year window is problematic because it yields few observations and focuses on treated observations in the very first post-HOPE cohorts. The 1993 and 1994 cohorts of entering freshmen were subject to an income cap for eligibility which reduced the percentage of Georgia students in these first cohorts who were affected by HOPE. Furthermore, focusing very close to the policy adoption exacerbates measurement error issues resulting from some students finishing high school at an age other than 18. Standard errors are clustered by year age 18, but significance levels are unchanged under several reasonable alternative inference procedures.|$|E

40|$|Speech is {{structured}} into parts by syntactic and prosodic breaks. in locally syntactic ambiguous sentences, {{the detection of}} <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break</b> necessarily follows detection of <b>a</b> corresponding prosodic <b>break,</b> making <b>an</b> investigation of the immediate interplay of syntactic and prosodic information impossible when studying sentences in isolation. This problem can be solved, however, by embedding sentences in a discourse context that induces the expectation of either the presence or the absence of <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break</b> <b>right</b> at <b>a</b> prosodic <b>break.</b> Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared to acoustically identical sentences in these different contexts. We found in two experiments that the closure positive shift, an ERP component known to be elicited by prosodic breaks, was reduced in size when <b>a</b> prosodic <b>break</b> was aligned with <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break.</b> These results establish that the brain matches prosodic information against syntactic information immediately...|$|R

5000|$|The {{second half}} {{continued}} in the same vein, with Partick Thistle winger John Mackenzie constantly beating Hungary full back Mihály Lantos. Bobby Johnstone scored a second goal for Scotland on 46 minutes, and only poor finishing prevented Scotland from equalising. The home side continued to press forward, but were caught on <b>a</b> counter <b>break</b> <b>right</b> {{at the end of}} the match when Kocsis scored to make the final score 2-4 to Hungary. It was the closest any team had come to beating Hungary in a friendly competition since 1950. Afterwards, Puskas complimented the excellent work of Mackenzie, stating that he had [...] "never seen wing play of such a high standard".|$|R
5000|$|In {{broadcast}} programming, a hot switch or hotswitching {{is where}} the ending of one television show leads directly into {{the start of the}} show in the next time slot without <b>a</b> television commercial <b>break.</b> The concept is used to reduce the chances that people will switch to another TV network during the commercial break and allow the cold open of the new show to attract viewers; sometimes however, this will cause <b>a</b> commercial <b>break</b> <b>right</b> after the opening credits. It can also be called [...] "seamless" [...] broadcasting and is frequently used during television marathons and back-to-back airings of episodes of the same series. The technique is also used by many local network affiliates in the United States to seamlessly transition from a local newscast to a network newscast.|$|R

Bob Dwyer recalls in The Winning Way that, [...] "We were {{deprived}} of one try when a ball which Campese chipped ahead after making <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> wing bounced backwards and touched the referee, who consequently had to call a scrum." [...] Dwyer also wrote that, [...] "If the ball had not taken an eccentric bounce and hit the referee, who was therefore obliged to set a scrum, this would certainly have resulted in a try." ...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Nathan Hindmarsh scored to take the lead to 12-0 before Lesley Vainikolo pounced on a loose ball to dive over on 49 minutes. When Henry Paul landed the conversion, the deficit was back down to six points. Soon after, Australian halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try. Rogers' third {{successful}} kick made it 18-6 to the defending champions. However, the Kiwis quickly struck back when Tonie Carroll beat several Australian defenders to score. Henry Paul's conversion made it 18-12.|$|R

50|$|When {{thrown by}} a {{right-handed}} pitcher, <b>a</b> screwball <b>breaks</b> {{from left to}} right {{from the point of view}} of the pitcher; the pitch therefore moves down and in on a right-handed batter and down and away from a left-handed batter. When thrown by a left-handed pitcher, <b>a</b> screwball <b>breaks</b> from <b>right</b> to left, moving down and in on a left-handed batter and down and away from a right-handed batter. Due to this left-to-right movement of the ball (when thrown by a right-handed pitcher), right-handed pitchers use a screwball against left-handed batters in the same way that they use a slider against right-handed batters. If thrown correctly, the screwball breaks in the opposite direction of a curveball.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Seers {{played in}} 25 games as Norths {{made it to}} the {{preliminary}} final before losing to eventual premiers Newcastle. During the match with Newcastle leading 12-4, Seers made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> hand touchline and looked certain to score a try when Darren Albert raced across the field and tackled Seers just short of the line. Norths made the semis again in 1998, with Seers making a mid-season change to centre and Ben Ikin playing at fullback. Seers played over a hundred games for the Bears, but after a period in rehab for a drug problem, signed with the Tigers for 2000.|$|R
50|$|Étude No. 1 {{focuses on}} right hand {{technique}} but includes challenging left hand chord patterns. The same right hand pattern is used {{through most of}} the piece while the left hand moves from open positions to capoed positions up the neck. In the 24th measure, there is <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from the <b>right</b> hand pattern and a descending line leads back into the fixed pattern we see mostly throughout the étude. Its measure 32, 3 bars from the end, harmonics are used to lead into the fermata held on an E. In a Lento tempo, there is a sweep into an A9 chord and in the last bar there is a sweep into an E chord with a B harmonic attached.|$|R
50|$|Together with Joe Simpson, Yates climbed Siula Grande in 1985, via the {{hitherto}} unclimbed west face. On the descent, Simpson {{fell through}} <b>a</b> cornice, <b>breaking</b> his <b>right</b> leg and heel. To continue descending, Yates then used ropes to lower Simpson {{down the mountain}} in stages. While descending in the night in bad weather, Yates lowered Simpson over an unseen cliff edge, which meant that he was hanging over a deep crevasse with only Simpson's hold on the rope to prevent him falling. To avoid being pulled off the mountain himself, Yates cut the rope. Simpson thus fell approximately 50 feet into the crevasse. He survived the fall, unbeknown to Yates, who assumed {{he must have been}} killed. Simpson managed to climb out of the crevasse and reached base camp four days later.|$|R
50|$|Kyle and Tina {{decide to}} forget about the {{break-up}} and join in the game. Meanwhile, Lisa attempts to warn Larry and Connie of the piñata, but neither of them believe her and continue on their search. As they do so, they pick up a shovel, and get a bunch of underwear from a secret stash. The piñata picks up the shovel, and crushes Connie's head before turning on Larry. Lisa goes to the camp, and tells Paul and Monica about what she saw. The judges, unsure about whether they should believe her or not, go to look for Bob. While they do so, Jake and Julie see the piñata, and when Jake goes to open it, the piñata grabs him and rips out his testicles while it beats Julie to death. Paul is later killed, as Kyle and Tina reconcile. A new group of Kyle, Tina, Doug, Carmen, and Lisa now leave when they see Bob ripped in half on a tree. Doug is hanged by the piñata. As Carmen and Lisa go back, Lisa takes <b>a</b> bathroom <b>break</b> <b>right</b> before Carmen gets her head chopped off. Monica finds Kyle and Tina. Lisa makes it to the camp and thinks Larry and Connie are in there just before she is killed by the piñata. Kyle, Tina and Monica kill the piñata by blowing it up by a Molotov cocktail.|$|R
50|$|Herrera saw {{the second}} leg, played some six weeks later, as the hardest match they would play that year, and hoped a replay {{would not be}} needed. Ladislao Kubala opened the scoring after only five minutes with a free kick from just outside the penalty area, and Barcelona had the better of the first half, but in the 44th minute, <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> was {{finished}} by Branislav Mihajlović from close range to tie the scores. It was Barcelona who began the second half playing hard, physical football. After 57 minutes, Evaristo avoided the attentions of two opponents to score Barcelona's second. When Martínez' cross shot went in, the Yugoslavs reacted badly, trying to attack the linesman, and Lazar Tasić was sent off. Neither side played football {{during the last few}} minutes of the match.|$|R
50|$|On 4 October, in the Cowboys' Grand Final {{match against}} the Brisbane Broncos, Feldt scored a try {{shortly after the}} {{full-time}} siren which levelled the scores and gave Johnathan Thurston {{a chance to win}} the match. Feldt scored in the corner after Thurston, pressured by Broncos front rowers Adam Blair and Sam Thaiday, was forced to pass to Michael Morgan on the final play who made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> edge and flick passed to Feldt after drawing a defender. Thurston missed the subsequent kick after it hit the upright. Feldt then produced a kick off that forced a mistake from Broncos halfback Ben Hunt which gave the Cowboys the field position required for Thurston to kick the winning field goal to win the match 17-16. Feldt finished off his premiership winning 2015 season having played in 9 matches, scoring 8 tries and kicking 1 goal.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, Catholic {{achieved}} five shutouts in its 8-1 {{regular season}} record, and secured its second bowl game appearance. They faced Tempe Normal Teacher's College (now Arizona State) in the 1940 Sun Bowl. The {{result was a}} scoreless stalemate, unusual {{in the fact that}} the teams had scored a total of 512 points during the season. After the game, both coaches claimed to have the superior team to the media. Dixie Howell of Tempe said, [...] "I believe we had the better team ... and would have won if we had gotten <b>a</b> <b>break</b> at the <b>right</b> time." [...] Bergman responded, [...] "Tempe is a fast, powerful team, but we didn’t play our top game by any means ... I think we are capable of beating Tempe six days out of the week."

5000|$|With {{nine minutes}} of the match remaining, Leeds were down at the opposition's end and on the fifth tackle moved the ball through the hands out to their left winger, Ryan Hall to barge through the defence and over the try-line. Sinfield couldn't kick the {{sideline}} conversion so Leeds trailed 18-22. After receiving the kick-off, the Rhinos made <b>a</b> good <b>break</b> through <b>right</b> winger Ben Jones-Bishop, who kicked the ball ahead into the in-goal area where neither of the Leeds or Wigan chasers racing though could secure it. [...] With less than {{two and a half}} minutes remaining, the Warriors were on Leeds' ten-metre line when dummy-half Tommy Leuluai ran through some tired marker defence to get over the line. The video referee was called upon to rule that the ball was not lost in the attempted grounding and the try was awarded. Richards converted successfully so the match ended in a Wigan 18-28 victory.|$|R
50|$|In a Group D {{match between}} Goa and Manipur on 17 November 2005, the referee Shaji C. Kurian allowed Goa {{to restart the}} game even {{as most of the}} Manipur players were celebrating Tomba Singh's goal in the 87th minute from a free kick. With the Manipur players {{unsettled}} for restart, Climax Lawrence rode on <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from the <b>right</b> and scored past Manipur goalkeeper Ingobi Singh. The Manipuri players argued with referee Kurian, disputing the restart. Police was called in due to be some shoving and pushing between players and there was some argument between the Manipur players and the local police. Game has only resumed after Manipur's coach Ekendra Singh and manager Dinamani Singh entered the ground and asked Manipur players to finish off the game. Even though the match ended in a tie, Goa advanced to the semifinals with their superior goal difference in Group D. Immediately after the incident, the Manipur team manager lodged a complaint contending violation of Rule No. 8 of the Laws of the Game, and Article No. 15 of the Regulation of the Championship.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the second half was held up by the {{appearance}} of a male streaker. When play finally got under way, the tackles were just as ferocious as ever, neither side giving an inch. However Australia gained the edge when Brad Fittler split the defence with a pass to Nathan Hindmarsh, who scored from close range, bringing the score to 10-0. Rogers converted to make it 12-0. New Zealand were not about to throw in the towel and hit back almost immediately. Lesley Vainikolo pounced on a loose ball to dive over on 49 minutes, although the decision was again made by the video referee. When Henry Paul landed the conversion, the deficit was back down to six points. Soon after, Australian Halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try. Rogers' third successful kick made it 18-6 to the defending champions. However, the Kiwis quickly struck back when Tonie Carroll beat several Australian defenders to score. Henry Paul's conversion made it 18-12.|$|R
50|$|The Manasquan Inlet {{is widely}} {{known as one}} of the best surf spots along the East Coast. Its {{popularity}} among beach breaks throughout the East Coast stems from the inlet, which directs and often enlarges the waves as they come in to create <b>a</b> great <b>right</b> <b>break.</b> Many competitions are held at the Manasquan Inlet throughout the year. One of the most popular is the Manasquan Classic Longboard Contest which is held in September of every year. This year the competition celebrated its 19th annual competition with a paddle out on September 11, commemorating the attacks on the World Trade Center a decade ago. Hurricane Bill, whose swell hit the shores of Manasquan in August 2009, brought many big-time professional surfers to the Manasquan Inlet including Andy Irons, Pete Mendia, Sam Hammer, and Mike Gleason.|$|R

50|$|Early {{penalties}} for infringements in the ruck by the Kiwis, gave Australia an early two points from a Johnathan Thurston kick. The Kangaroos then mirrored this, conceding consecutive penalties that allowed Stacey Jones' goal {{a few minutes later}} to even the scores at 2 all. In the tenth minute Australia had the ball in the centre of the field and passed it out to Mark Gasnier who made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> then passed to his winger Brent Tate to finish. Thurston's conversion was successful, so the home side led 8 - 2. Another penalty in the ruck in the twenty-first minute led to a minor scuffle and a goal from Thurston, extending the Kangaroos' lead to 10 - 2. Five minutes later New Zealand were ten metres into the Australians' half when Stacy Jones put a little chip kick {{over the heads of the}} Kangaroos for Brent Webb to run through and catch before drawing the defence and passing it on to Frank Pritchard who diver over untouched in the left corner. Jones missed the difficult conversion attempt, leaving the score 10 - 6 in favour of Australia. In the remaining ten minutes of play before half-time no more points were scored.|$|R
50|$|Having been bounced in {{the second}} round by Lukas Rosol in 2012, the first round by Steve Darcis in 2013, and riding a three match grass losing streak, Nadal entered the 2014 edition of Wimbledon looking for redemption. His first match started off rocky as he dropped the opening set against Martin Kližan, but he {{recovered}} to win in four and snap his losing streak. Up next was his 2012 conqueror, Rosol. Rosol looked capable of pulling out the upset once again as he led by a set and <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> but Nadal <b>righted</b> the ship and got revenge for his 2012 defeat by pulling the match out in four. Nadal again recovered from a set down against Mikhail Kukushkin in the third round, marking {{the first time in his}} career that he won three consecutive matches after dropping the first set. Nadal went on to face 19-year-old wildcard Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round and once again dropped the opening set, but was unable to recover this time and succumbed to Kyrgios in four sets. It was Nadal's first defeat to a player born in the 1990s and the first time a teenager had beaten the World No. 1 at a Grand Slam since Nadal himself beat Roger Federer at the 2005 French Open.|$|R
