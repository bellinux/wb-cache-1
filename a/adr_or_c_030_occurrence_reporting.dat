40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the cost of}} illness (COI) of individuals with self-reported adverse drug events (ADEs) from a societal perspective and to compare these estimates with the COI for individuals without ADE. Furthermore, to {{estimate the}} direct costs resulting from two ADE categories, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and subtherapeutic effects of medication therapy (STE). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The adult Swedish general population. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was distributed to {{a random sample of}} 14 000 Swedish residents aged 18 years and older, of which 7099 responded, 1377 reported at least one ADE and 943 reported an <b>ADR</b> <b>or</b> STE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal COI, including direct and indirect costs, for individuals with at least one self-reported ADE, and the direct costs for prescription drugs and healthcare use resulting from self-reported ADRs and STEs were estimated during 30 days using a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: The economic burden for individuals with ADEs were (95 % CI) 442. 7 to 599. 8 international dollars (Int$), of which direct costs were Int$ 279. 6 to 420. 0 (67. 1 %) and indirect costs were Int$ 143. 0 to 199. 8 (32. 9 %). The average COI was higher among those reporting ADEs compared with other respondents (COI: Int$ 442. 7 to 599. 8 versus Int$ 185. 8 to 231. 2). The COI of respondents reporting at least one <b>ADR</b> <b>or</b> STE was Int$ 468. 9 to 652. 9. Direct costs resulting from <b>ADRs</b> <b>or</b> STEs were Int$ 15. 0 to 48. 4. The reported resource use occurred both in hospitals and outside in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported ADRs and STEs cause resource use both in hospitals and in primary care.

We have previously reported that ADR has nuclear localization and that ADRIGLU localizes exclusively in the cytoplasm. During <b>ADR</b> <b>or</b> ADRIGLU treatment, significant depletion of the cell energy state, demonstrated by a reduction in high-energy phosphates (ATP and GTP) and a decrease in energy charge potential (ECP), were recorded between 2 hours and 24 hours, by HPLC analysis.

Confocal microscopic analysis, using the potential-sensitive dye JC- 1, showed that inhibition of cell energy metabolism was preceded by a rapid decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m). With the progression of exposure time, the early depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane was followed by a transient reversion to normal delta psi m until, in apoptotic cells, almost all mitochondrial subpopulations appeared to be hyperpolarized. Our results indicated that mitochondria are actively involved in anthracycline-induced programmed cell death, suggesting a novel mechanism that may be common to all forms of apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chemotherapeutic {{drugs like}} Adriamycin (<b>ADR)</b> induces {{apoptosis}} <b>or</b> senescence in cancer cells but these cells often develop resistance and generate responses of short duration or complete failure. The methylxantine drug Pentoxifylline (PTX) used routinely in the clinics setting for circulatory diseases has been recently described to have antitumor properties. We evaluated whether pretreatment with PTX modifies apoptosis and senescence induced by ADR in cervix cancer cells. Methods HeLa (HPV 18 +), SiHa (HPV 16 +) cervix cancer cells and non-tumorigenic immortalized HaCaT cells (control) {{were treated with}} PTX, <b>ADR</b> <b>or</b> PTX + <b>ADR.</b> The cellular toxicity of PTX and survival fraction were determinated by WST- 1 and clonogenic assay respectively. Apoptosis, caspase activation and ADR efflux rate were measured by flow cytometry, senescence by microscopy. IκBα and DNA fragmentation were determinated by ELISA. Proapoptotic, antiapoptotic and senescence genes, as well as HPV-E 6 /E 7 mRNA expression, were detected by time real RT-PCR. p 53 protein levels were assayed by Western blot. Results PTX is toxic (WST- 1), affects survival (clonogenic assay) and induces apoptosis in cervix cancer cells. Additionally, the combination of this drug with ADR diminished the survival fraction and significantly increased apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cervix cancer cells. Treatments were less effective in HaCaT cells. We found caspase participation in the induction of apoptosis by PTX, <b>ADR</b> <b>or</b> its combination. Surprisingly, {{in spite of the}} antitumor activity displayed by PTX, our results indicate that methylxantine, per se does not induce senescence; however it inhibits senescence induced by ADR {{and at the same time}} increases apoptosis. PTX elevates IκBα levels. Such sensitization is achieved through the up-regulation of proapoptotic factors such as caspase and bcl family gene expression. PTX and PTX + ADR also decrease E 6 and E 7 expression in SiHa cells, but not in HeLa cells. p 53 was detected only in SiHa cells treated with ADR. Conclusion PTX is a good inducer of apoptosis but does not induce senescence. Furthermore, PTX reduced the ADR-induced senescence and increased apoptosis in cervix cancer cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|In vitro HBV {{infection}} and neutralization were assayed using an anti-preS 1 murine monoclonal antibody (1 B 3) and anti-preS 2 (H 69 K) and anti-S (CS 131 A) murine-human chimeric antibodies. The 1 B 3 (IgG 1) and H 69 K (IgG 1) was constructed previously and the CS 131 A was constructed {{for this study}} by expressing stably the chimeric heavy and light chains in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purifying from the culture supernatant. Previous study showed that the H 69 K and CS 131 A recognize known virus-neutralizing epitopes, while the 183 does not. For the assays, adult human hepatocyte primary culture was infected with the <b>adr</b> <b>or</b> ayw subtype of HBV, and the infectivity and subsequent replication was confirmed both by measuring the kinetics of HBsAg secretion by the infected cells and detecting the intermediate replicative form of HBV DNA in the cells. Next, the hepatocytes were infected with the <b>adr</b> <b>or</b> ayw subtype of the virus that had been preincubated with various concentrations {{of each of the}} antibodies and the neutralization of HBV was analyzed. The results showed that the anti-preS 2 and anti-S chimeric antibodies exhibited neutralizing activity against both the adr and ayw subtypes of the virus, with approximately 1, 000 and 2, 000 times higher specific activity than polyclonal hepatitis B immune globulin, respectively, but the anti-preS 1 antibody scarcely neutralized the infection. The neutralizing activities of the antibodies were consistent with their epitope specificity and antigen-binding affinity, suggesting that this neutralization assay is specific.

40|$|Motivation: Drug-induced {{toxicity}} related proteins (DITRPs) are {{proteins that}} mediate adverse drug reactions (<b>ADRs)</b> <b>or</b> toxicities through their binding to drugs or reactive metabolites. Collection of these proteins facilitates {{better understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity and the rational drug discovery. Drug-induced toxicity related protein database (DITOP) is such a database that is intending to provide comprehensive information of DITRPs. Currently, DITOP contains 1501 records, covering 618 distinct literature-reported DITRPs, 529 drugs/ligands and 418 distinct toxicity terms. These proteins were confirmed experimentally to interact with drugs or their reactive metabolites, thus directly or indirectly cause adverse effects or toxicities. Five major types of drug-induced toxicities <b>or</b> <b>ADRs</b> are included in DITOP, which are the idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, the dosedependent toxicities, the drug–drug interactions, the immunemediated adverse drug effects (IMADEs) and the toxicities caused by genetic susceptibility. Molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity and cross-links to related resources are also provided while available. Moreover, a series of user-friendly interfaces were designed for flexible retrieval of DITRPs-related information. The DITOP can be accessed freely a...|$|R
