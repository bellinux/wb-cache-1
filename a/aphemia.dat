This lineup conisited as Pete Morten on vocals (vocalist for My Soliloquy, Metalloid, and Nightmare World and touring guitarist for Threshold), Andy Midgley on guitar (guitarist for female-fronted prog/symphonic metal band Liquid Sky), Ben Randall on guitars (winner of the 2008 'Most Promising Young Guitarist Award' at the {{international}} Guitar Idol competition), Paul Finnie on bass (ex-stage manager for Power Quest and former bassist of post-punk band The Wake), and Rich Smith on drums (touring drummer with Vader, Dark Funeral, Old Man's Child, Green Carnation and The Blood Divine also ex member of Thunder Force and electro-rock/industrial band <b>Aphemia).</b> [...] The band ended 2009 touring the UK with the Michael Schenker Group.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aphemia,</b> {{also called}} {{anarthria}} or severe apraxia of speech, {{is a rare}} disorder of speech production usually resulting from vascular lesions affecting the inferior premotor cortex of the left hemisphere.

40|$|<b>Aphemia</b> is a {{disorder}} of articulation of speech. Broca {{coined the term}} <b>aphemia</b> in 1861 to describe a stroke patient with complete articulatory failure without language dysfunction. 1 <b>Aphemia</b> secondary to acute ischemia is a rare disorder, which if diagnosed accurately and treated appropriately could be reversed, as illustrated in the case below. We describe two patients with acute <b>aphemia</b> who presented to the emergency department consecutively. The first patient was a right handed man, aged 80 years {{with a history of}} hypertension and coronary artery disease. He developed sudden onset speech difficulty. Examination revealed a conscious, alert patient with normal comprehension, without speech output. He made grunting sounds, but could not produce words. He wrote sentences without grammatical errors. Reading comprehension was normal. He did not have oro-bucco-facial apraxia and was able to move the tongue and lips to command. He had a mild right upper motor neuron-type facial paresis. His palatal movements were normal. Other examination was normal...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present the}} case of a 54 -year-old man with loss of speech, but with {{preservation}} of voluntary facio-lingual motility, language and other cognitive abilities (Broca's <b>aphemia).</b> METHOD: Observation of patient oral communicative abilities and general behavior, neuropsychological assessment and cranial computed tomography. RESULTS: Computed tomography showed a hyperdense lesion in the subcortex of the left precentral gyrus corresponding to Brodmann's area 6 and 44. Neuropsychological assessment confirmed that the major cognitive domains were intact. CONCLUSION: Our patient reiterates the validity of Broca's <b>aphemia</b> as a clinico-anatomic entity allowing us to portray {{it for the first time}} in pictures. From a neurobehavioral perspective, <b>aphemia</b> is related to apraxia rather than to aphasia, a fact that may have hampered the full grasp of its far-reaching implications for neurology and aphasiology...|$|E
40|$|A case is {{presented}} of a 13 -year-old right-handed male who exhibited bilateral striato-capsular lesions following {{an episode of}} cerebral anoxia {{and a range of}} clinical features typical of <b>aphemia.</b> The findings of a neurological assessment, neuroradiological assessment and battery of speech/language tests are described and their implications for current theories regarding the role of the basal ganglia in speech/language function discussed. The patient initially demonstrated an isolated loss of the ability to articulate words without the loss of the ability to write or comprehend spoken language. His initial mutism later resolved into a dysarthria with features similar to those seen in hypokinetic dysarthria. It was concluded that striato-capsular lesions in childhood are capable of producing temporary language disturbances and in some cases a persistent dysarthria...|$|E
40|$|De Oliveira-Souza, Moll, and Tovar-Moll (this issue) {{historically}} reevaluate that Paul Broca's <b>aphemia</b> {{should be}} considered as a kind of apraxia rather than aphasia. I argue that such a claim is unwarranted, given the interpretation of the faculty of speech Broca derived from his predecessors, Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud and Franz Joseph Gall, and also with a view on the then generally held opinion that the terms aph√©mie and aphasie were synonyms. I will discuss evidence that patients such as Leborgne, producing only very few words or syllables, suffer from a global aphasia, affecting all modalities, despite Broca's statement that Leborgne's comprehension was intact. I also point to Broca's claim that the faculty of speech, located in the left anterior hemisphere, is independent from hand preference because it is an intellectual and not a motor function, and to his statement that the cerebral convolutions are not motor organs. I finally contend that, in order to determine whether a given language problem should be labeled as aphasia or apraxia, it is crucial to first be clear on the components of old and new models of language production...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A case of mutism due to left {{hemisphere}} infarction is described. Recovery revealed mild motor dysphasia. Review {{of the literature}} showed that the case resembles <b>aphemia</b> but is unique {{by virtue of its}} duration, and the absence of associated apraxia and paresis. Mutism is a rare clinical entity. It may occur trans- any limb. Reflexes were symmetrical and the plantar iently in lesions of Broca's area, ' or the inferior responses flexor. Indirect laryngoscopy showed normal rolandic region. 2 We describe a case of total mutism larynx and vocal chord movement. following left common carotid artery occlusion in CT scanning without contrast showed a very small area the absence of hemiparesis and oro-bucco-lingual of reduced density in relation to the left sylvian fissure. A apraxia which we believe to be due to a highly repeat scan with contrast revealed a large area of specific apraxia of speech. enhancement in the left fronto-parietal region extending to Case report A 51 -year-old, right-handed housewife, with a history of controlled hypertension, was on holiday abroad when she awoke, unable to speak.
