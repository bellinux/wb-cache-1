5|$|The 14-story Centurion Tower was {{completed}} in 1970 {{at a cost of}} $4.2 million. In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. The concept was that the tower was to be <b>a</b> <b>boutique</b> hotel within the resort. Because the exterior was unchanged, the interior with only 181 rooms, small by Vegas standards, is more spacious with bigger rooms than the standard hotel. The motif is Asian luxury with high end amenities, including a sake bar and strict security which uses optical scanners. Each room has a sitting area, a spacious bedroom with black lacquered furniture and artworks. The bathroom contains a double-sized stall with a teak shower stall, black tiles and a large rain-style showerhead.|$|E

A new magistrates' court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of £38,400 (now £) and constructed between 1879–81. Oscar Wilde {{was arrested and charged with}} gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an overnight stay on remand, he ordered tea, toast and eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building is planned to be converted into <b>a</b> <b>boutique</b> hotel.|$|E
