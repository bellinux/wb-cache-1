Results indicate that firm property tax <b>abatements</b> are offered by a community to offset noncapitalized profit-reducing characteristics. Property tax <b>abatements</b> are effective at increasing nonresidential property bases, but at costs (decreased home values, increased local property tax rates, and increased state subsidies to local governments) that should not be ignored by policy makers. ...|$|R

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise <b>abatement</b> regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E

40|$|Electricity {{supply is}} {{frequently}} {{cited as a}} significant hot spot in life cycle assessment (LCA) results. Despite its importance, however, LCA research continues to overuse simplified methodologies regarding electricity supply modeling. This work aims to demonstrate the usefulness of electricity trade analysis (proposed model) for integrating the short-term dynamics of electricity supply and refining LCA results. Distributed generation using renewable energy is applied {{as a case study}} to demonstrate how electricity trade analysis provides more refined estimates when environmental impact <b>abatements</b> are assessed compared with the conventional (simplified) approaches in LCA. Grid-connected photovoltaic panel (3 kWp mono- and poly-crystalline) and micro-wind turbine (1, 10 and 30 kW) environmental impact <b>abatements</b> are investigated by determining the displaced marginal electricity production on an hourly basis. The results indicate that environmental impact <b>abatements</b> calculated using the developed short-term time horizon approach can be significantly different (up to 200 % difference) from those obtained using a simplified approach. Recommendations are provided to LCA practitioners to address this issue of differing results. ...|$|R

40|$|Incentives {{offered by}} cities to attract {{businesses}} {{have been used}} in America for well over a century, but not until the post-war years did their use become truly widespread. And while the practice of incentives has had at least forty years of intense academic scrutiny, it remains difficult to assertively answer many of the questions that have been put forth: Do tax incentives actually influence the firmâ€™s location decisions? Do incentives result in increased business activity in blighted areas, or do firms simply go to the richest places with the most money to offer? Is incentive use a zero-sum game at the national level, simply re-arranging the pattern of business activity that would have occurred anyway? Are incentives an efficient method of promoting economic development? These and other issues this paper will attempt to address. It begins with {{a review of the literature}} on tax <b>abatements</b> as a specific method of economic development. The focus on tax <b>abatements</b> stems from a desire to examine the economic development practices of Lawrence, Kansas, which currently uses tax <b>abatements</b> as its primary development tool. Following the discussion of <b>abatements</b> this paper turns to the more general issue of incentives as a method of economic development. It lists the intuitive theories behind tax incentives then reports the findings from several surveys and econometric studies...|$|R

25|$|Under the program, the <b>abatement</b> {{lasts for}} three years of {{construction}} and 35 additional years. A full <b>abatement</b> on the tax increase will take place for the first 25 years after the construction period, with the tax benefits {{in the last ten}} years being tied to the number of affordable units created. For condominium projects, the new 421-a program is also an option. However, condominium projects only qualify for this program if the project has 35 units or less, is not located in Manhattan, and has a per unit assessed value at $65,000 or less. The <b>abatement</b> program excludes luxury condominiums projects after a proposal to include them was defeated in the state legislature.

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} the 421-a tax <b>abatement</b> program unfairly drains city tax revenue. The current tax breaks cost the city about $1.4 billion in lost tax revenue annually.
