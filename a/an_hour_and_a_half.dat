5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault. Although Caen's strategic importance had vastly diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later, the High Seas Fleet {{under the}} command of Admiral Scheer left the Jade; the force was {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts. The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser Rostock. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 05:00.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became {{the site of the}} Turkish headquarters {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures for at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and {{the rest}} of the III Battle Squadron were the leading unit of the High Seas Fleet; the four s led the line. Kaiser, the {{flagship}} of Konteradmiral H. Nordmann, was directly astern of the four Königs. I Battle Squadron, composed of the eight - and s, followed III Squadron, with the six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron bringing up the rear. Hipper's five battlecruisers left the Jade estuary at 02:00 on 31 May; Scheer, with the High Seas Fleet, followed <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, Confiance met the 40-gun East Indiaman Kent, of 824tons burthen, under Captain Robert Rivington. Kent had rescued {{the crew}} of another ship, the Queen, {{destroyed}} by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of battle across the decks of the ship, seize control of the Kent.|$|E
5|$|After <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{had gone}} (and twenty minutes {{had passed since}} the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance {{difference between the two}} variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E

5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> Enron's {{audit committee}} {{did not have the}} technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{delivery}} from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat {{from his hands}} and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Sidle {{was born}} on September 16, 1971, in Tomales Bay, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> north of San Francisco. Her father was an abusive {{alcoholic}} and was killed by Sidle's schizophrenic mother in 1984. Afterward, she spent time in the foster care system, which didn't keep her from graduating high school as valedictorian at age 16. She attended Harvard on a scholarship, moving on to graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. While at Berkeley, she started a work-study position at the San Francisco Coroner's Office, where she would also audit lectures {{to keep up with}} new developments; it was at one of these that she met Gil Grissom.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. <b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 there was another lull in the fighting for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Guam then {{returned}} to Task Force 58, assigned to Cruiser Division 16, part of Task Group 58.4, and steamed to Okinawa. On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu. Guam and Alaska bombarded Oki Daitō for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> on 9 June, after which they steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf, arriving on 13 June.|$|E

5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses who claim to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once for about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts left 700,000people {{without power}} from Miami to West Palm Beach, {{including}} the National Hurricane Center. The center briefly lost power, but during <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> delay to reboot the computers, they obtained information from {{computers in the}} Mid-West and Washington, D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to strong wind gusts, while Irene's flooding submerged underground lines, preventing repairs until the waters subsided. Five people, including three in one family, were killed when they walked through electrified waters due to downed power lines. The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals, stalling numerous cars. Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals. The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas, displacing hundreds {{from their homes and}} isolating thousands. Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $262million.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish captains, {{recognising}} {{that they}} were outmatched by the larger British vessels, attempted to shelter in Conil Bay, a rocky stretch of coastline {{near the village of}} Conil de la Frontera to the north of Cape Trafalgar. At 14:30 they were discovered by Martin's ships, which had to carefully negotiate a large rock formation known as the Laja de Cape Rocha which protected the head of the bay. With this obstacle successfully behind them, Irresistible and Emerald attacked the anchored Spanish frigates broadside to broadside. The action lasted <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> with the Spanish ships taking much the worst of the damage. At 16:00, both battered Spanish vessels surrendered, although as the British ships launched boats to take possession of their prizes, the crew of Santa Elena hacked through the anchor cables and allowed their ship to drift onto the rocky shoreline where they disembarked and escaped inland.|$|E
