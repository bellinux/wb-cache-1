According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get <b>along</b> <b>well,</b> and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow {{never made it to}} America.

30|$|Figure 14 shows SW–NE seismic section <b>along</b> <b>wells</b> Qasr- 07 - 42 - 10 - 31. The {{negative}} seismic amplitude, {{from high}} to low impedance or vice versa, {{is clear and}} continuous <b>along</b> <b>wells</b> Qasr- 07, - 42 and Qasr- 10. The plan to symmetrical convex upward geometry appears across wells Qasr- 42 and Qasr- 10, which may indicates a channel-like facies. The seismic reflectors change from positive to negative along top D 2 -unit between wells Qasr- 10 and Qasr- 31, {{and this may be}} due to lithological variation between sand, shale and siltstone across these wells. The variation in lithology, as depicted from well data and changing seismic signature, may be due to a braided channel system or deposition in a transitional continental to marginal marine environment.|$|R

5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got <b>along</b> <b>well,</b> and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E

5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got <b>along</b> <b>well</b> with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E

During this time, Hayley alternated with Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, who had recently returned from maternity leave, to maintain a five-member line-up.

Irwin spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get <b>along</b> <b>well,</b> and Sweeney left the team {{in the middle of the}} season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{description}} of core samples is always the most reliable data in sedimentary facies, due to {{the limited number of}} core samples, information on sedimentary facies based on core samples are localized and fragmented.

5|$|Local {{interest}} in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation {{began to develop}} in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the Inland Waterways Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their energies to the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily silted. Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage <b>along</b> <b>Well</b> Creek was very difficult. The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning {{for it to be}} dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975.|$|E

After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans to choose an ugly dog and teach it destructive behavior. At the shelter, Logan encounters a young female mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog.|$|E

He got <b>along</b> <b>well</b> with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door knocker), due to their failure to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with direct fire.|$|E

5|$|On {{graduating in}} June 1922, Parsons was {{commissioned}} as an ensign and posted to the battleship , {{where he was}} placed in charge {{of one of the}} 14-inch gun turrets. In May 1927, Parsons, now a lieutenant (junior grade), returned to Annapolis, where he commenced a course in ordnance at the Naval Postgraduate School. He became friends with Lieutenant Jack Crenshaw, a fellow officer attending the same training course. Jack asked Parsons to be best man at his wedding to Betty Cluverius, the daughter of the Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard, Rear Admiral Wat Tyler Cluverius, Jr., at the Norfolk Navy Chapel. As best man, Parsons was paired with Betty's maid of honor, her sister Martha. Parsons and Martha got <b>along</b> <b>well,</b> and in November 1929, they too were married at the Norfolk Navy Chapel. This time, Jack and Betty were best man and maid of honor.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got <b>along</b> <b>well</b> with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is <b>along</b> <b>Well</b> Creek, passing {{over the top of}} the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
