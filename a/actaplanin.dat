5000|$|<b>Actaplanin</b> is {{a complex}} of broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} made by Actinoplanes bacteria. Research carried out by a group in Eli Lilly and Co. in 1984 identified several actaplanins using high-performance liquid chromatography. Actaplanins A, B1, B2, B3, C1 and G were shown to be composed of the same peptide core, an amino sugar, and varying amounts of glucose, mannose, and rhamnose.|$|E
40|$|The {{vancomycin}} resistance {{expressed by}} several strains of Enterococcus gallinarum was studied. Resistance was expressed constitutively, {{as demonstrated by}} analysis of growth and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. E. gallinarum strains were moderately resistant to vancomycin (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) but were as susceptible as vancomycin-susceptible enterococci to the glycopeptides, teicoplanin, A 35512 B, A 47934, A 4103 A, and A 41030 E and the glycopeptide <b>actaplanins</b> A 1, B 2, and C 1. Vancomycin resistance in E. gallinarum was inhibited by beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations that saturated penicillin-binding protein 6 (PBP 6), as demonstrated by binding competition experiments. Spontaneous mutants (frequency, 10 (- 8)) were two- to fourfold more resistant to beta-lactam inhibition of vancomycin resistance than the parent strain. PBP binding competition experiments suggested that PBP 6 in the mutants bound less cefotaxime, while binding of penicillin and cefoxitin was unaffected. Both a bioassay method and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that E. gallinarum membranes have enzymatic activity which modifies a model pentapeptide yielding a product that {{is thought to be}} a tetrapeptide. This activity could be a D,D-carboxypeptidase. In both the parent E. gallinarum strain and its derivatives that were resistant to the synergistic drug combination, the activity was inhibited by beta-lactams at concentrations which correlated with those that inhibit vancomycin resistance and those that saturate PBP 6. These results suggest the possibility that PBP 6 may be involved in the vancomycin resistance of E. gallinarum and that the putative D,D-carboxypeptidase activity seen in E. gallinarum membranes may be attributable to PBP 6...|$|R
