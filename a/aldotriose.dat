Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an <b>aldotriose,</b> there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light.

There {{are only three}} possible trioses: L-Glyceraldehyde and D-Glyceraldehyde, both <b>aldotrioses</b> because the carbonyl group {{is at the end}} of the chain, and dihydroxyacetone, a ketotriose because the carbonyl group is the center of the chain.|$|R
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) data (linear retention indices {{and relative}} areas) and mass spectra (most representative m/z fragments) of 12 reducing trisaccharides as trimethylsilyl oximes (TMSO) and four non-reducing as trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers {{have been described}} {{for the first time}} and related to their structural features. Some trends have been observed: earlier elution of non-reducing compounds and fructotrioses; <b>aldotrioses</b> bearing the reducing end with link in position 6 showing the highest retention. Abundance of several fragment ions and their ratios were useful for trisaccharide characterization; some of these features seem to be useful for the characterization of new trisaccharides. © 2009 Elsevier B.

5000|$|Aldoses, {{like all}} {{carbohydrates}} are categorized {{first by the}} presence of an aldehyde or a ketone on the carbon chain. They can be further differentiated by the number of carbons in the main chain using Greek prefixes. The minimum number of carbons in a backbone needed to form a molecule that is still considered a carbohydrate is 3, and carbohydrates with three carbons are called trioses. The only <b>aldotriose</b> is Glyceraldehyde, which has one chiral stereocenter with 2 possible enantiomers, D and L Glyceraldehyde. The most commonly discussed category of aldoses are those with 6 carbons, aldohexoses. Some aldohexoses that are widely called by common names are ...|$|E

40|$|Ammonia and amines (including amino acids) {{were shown}} to {{catalyze}} the formation of sugars from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, and the subsequent conversion of sugars to carbonylcontaining products under the conditions studied (pH 5. 5 and 50 degrees C). Sterically unhindered primary amines were better catalysts than ammonia, secondary amines, and sterically hindered primary amines (i. e. alpha-aminoisobutyric acid). Reactions catalyzed by primary amines initially consumed formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde about 15 - 20 times faster than an uncatalyzed control reaction. The amine-catalyzed reactions yielded <b>aldotriose</b> (glyceraldehyde), ketotriose (dihydroxyacetone), aldotetroses (erythrose and threose), ketotetrose (erythrulose), pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, pyruvate, glyoxylate, and several unindentified carbonyl products. The concentrations of the carbonyl products, except pyruvate and ketotetrose, initially increased and then declined during the reaction, indicating their ultimate conversion to other products (like larger sugars or pyruvate). The uncatalyzed control reaction yielded no pyruvate or glyoxylate, and only trace amounts of pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde and glyoxal. In the presence of 15 mM catalytic primary amine, such as alanine, the rates of triose and pyruvaldehyde of synthesis were about 15 -times and 1200 -times faster, respectively, than the uncatalyzed reaction. Since previous studies established that alanine is synthesized from glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde via pyruvaldehyde as its direct precursor, the demonstration that the alanine catalyzes the conversion of glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde to pyruvaldehyde indicates that this synthetic pathway is capable of autocatalysis. The relevance of this synthetic process, named the Sugar Model, to {{the origin of life}} is discussed...|$|E
