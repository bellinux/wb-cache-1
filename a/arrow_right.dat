Overall, 22. 4 % of isolates had extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). The most active antibiotics among the 11 tested were imipenem, amikacin, and ertapenem, though even these, like all other comparators, were less consistently active against ESBL-positive isolates than against ESBL-negative isolates. Globally, 6. 5 % of isolates were ertapenem resistant based on the June 2010 clinical breakpoints published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, with MICs of = 1 µg/ml. Molecular characterization of 43 isolates with ertapenem MICs of = 4 µg/ml showed that they variously produced CTX-M or SHV ESBLs combined with altered impermeability and/or had KPC (n = 28), OXA- 48 (n = 3), or VIM (n = 1) carbapenemases.

Effect of Sequence Variation in Plasmodium falciparum Histidine- Rich Protein 2 on Binding of Specific Monoclonal Antibodies: Implications for Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Malaria{dagger} Nelson Lee, 1, 2 Joanne Baker, 2 Kathy T.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to address this need. Reports of significant variation in the field performance of RDTs based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP 2) (PfHRP 2) and of significant sequence polymorphism in PfHRP 2 led us to evaluate the binding of four HRP 2 -specific monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to parasite proteins from geographically distinct P. falciparum isolates, define the epitopes recognized by these MABs, and relate the copy number of the epitopes to MAB reactivity. We observed {{a significant difference in}} the reactivity of the same MAB to different isolates and between different MABs tested with single isolates. When the target epitopes of three of the MABs were determined and mapped onto the peptide sequences of the field isolates, significant variability in the frequency of these epitopes was observed. These findings support the role of sequence variation as an explanation for variations in the performance of HRP 2 -based RDTs and point toward possible approaches to improve their diagnostic sensitivitie...|$|R

During cold-rolling, both the alpha (RD//[110]) and the gamma (ND//[111]) fibres were observed to be strengthened, although {{the increase in}} alpha was more pronounced. Simulations of the cold-rolling using Taylor type theories demonstrated an approximate predictability of the textural changes. Recrystallization strengthened the gamma, as F (= { 111 }[112]) increased but E (={ 111 }[110]) remained essentially unchanged. A corresponding decrease in alpha, more in H (={ 001 }[110]) than in I (=z{ 112 }[110]), was also observed. The strong gamma-fibre recrystallization texture was mainly due to the larger numbers (i. e. 'frequency advantage') of the gamma-oriented grains, as the gamma rains were no larger than grains of other orientations. TEM studies showed an increase in cell size and a decrease and cell misorientation (which means an increase in stored energy) from H double <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> I double <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> E double <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> F.

It was shown that: (1) the reduced thickness of the tetrahedral sheet in Ba-rich biotites supports the coupled substitution (IV) Si + (XII) K half arrow left over half <b>arrow</b> <b>right</b> (IV) Al + (XII) Ba; (2) the interlayer site geometry is affected by the whole layer chemistry and does not reflect only local chemical variations; (3) in two samples of the 2 M 1 polytype, the M(1) octahedral site is larger and more distorted than the M(2) sites because of the preferential ordering of Fe 2 + in the M(1) site, whereas one sample shows complete cation disorder in the octahedral sites. Biotite- 1 M shows that Fe 2 + can also be located in the M(2) site. Some {{of the differences between the}} biotites of gabbros and diorites (e. g. Ba concentration and exchange vectors) may be linked to the host rock composition and to its crystallization process. Biotite occurs in trace amounts in gabbros and its crystallization is related to the interstitial melt which contributed to the adcumulus growth of the main rock forming phases and became highly enriched in K, Ba and Ti. Diorites are the result of equilibrium crystallization of a residual melt rich in incompatible elements, where biotite is a major constituent...|$|E
40|$|Strict {{singularity}} {{and strict}} co-singularity of inclusions between symmetric sequence spaces are studied. Suitable conditions are provided involving the associated fundamental functions. The special case of Lorentz and Marcinkiewicz spaces is characterized. It is also proved that if E hooked <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> F are symmetric sequence spaces with E ≠ l(1) and F ≠ l c(0) and l(∞) then there exist a intermediate symmetric sequence space G such that E hooked <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> G hooked <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> F and both inclusions are not strictly singular. As a consequence new characterizations of the spaces c(o) and l(1) inside {{the class of}} all symmetric sequence spaces are given...|$|R

The anti-automorphism g bar <b>arrow</b> pointing <b>right</b> g(- 1) of G extends linearly to an anti-automorphism a bar <b>arrow</b> pointing <b>right</b> a* of KG. An element a of KG is called symmetric if a* = a. In this paper we answer the question: for which G and K do the symmetric units of KG form a multiplicative group...|$|R

In pp -> pp (omega) over <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> one can choose decay planes with different orientations for a given direction of the momentum q of the omega meson produced. By choosing three different experimentally convenient orientations of the decay planes for the same q, one may determine empirically the t(0) (2) and t(+/- 2) (2) characterizing the tensor polarization of omega in the transverse frame for pp -> pp (omega) over <b>right</b> <b>arrow...</b>|$|R
