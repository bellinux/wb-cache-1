500|$|Njai Dasima ( [...] ; Perfected Spelling: Nyai Dasima) is a 1932 {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) which was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film. It was the second film adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, following a silent version in 1929. Starring Momo and Oesman, it followed a young Sundanese njai (concubine) who is tricked into marrying <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not love her and ultimately killed for her money. The film, the first talkie produced by its company, {{was also the first}} directed by a native Indonesian. The now-lost work received mixed critical reception.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth {{was in love with}} her {{childhood}} friend Robert Dudley. It was said that Amy Robsart, his wife, was suffering from a [...] "malady in one of her breasts" [...] and that the Queen would like to marry Dudley if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England: [...] "There is not <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not cry out on him and her with indignation... she will marry none but the favoured Robert". Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected Dudley of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{reception}} was mixed, review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} rating of 55%, based on a sample of 221 reviews; the site's consensus reading [...] "It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better," [...] for comparison, Wall Street (1987) had achieved a 78% positive rating. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News awarded it five out of five stars {{saying that it is}} a sharp sequel that is worthy of its investment. He also saluted the cast's performance and noted that Douglas gives Gekko [...] "uncounted layers as he fakes, deals and fuels fire". Matthew Toomey of Australia's 612 ABC Radio Brisbane gave it a B-rating and said that Douglas is the film's [...] "biggest positive", finding LaBeouf to be unconvincing in his role. Christy Lemire, in The Canadian Press, claimed that the film ultimately [...] "goes soft and loses its way" [...] and described the contrast in its final scenes as being [...] "laughable". Furthermore, the subplot between LaBeouf and Mulligan's characters as unneeded and pointed out that their relationship leads viewers to wonder why Winnie, who despises Gekko, would be involved with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> exactly the same thing as him, which she condemns; however, Lemire acknowledged that the movie is an uncommon sequel that seems to be both relevant and necessary and said that it proves that [...] "greed can still be good". Film critic Colin Newton of the Brisbane Sunday Mail felt that the plot lacked the enthusiasm of the first film. Along the same lines, Village Voice contributor Nick Pinkerton pointed out that the Wall Street sequel did not have the [...] "clean, fable-like arc" [...] formula of its predecessor.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} by Swami Vivekananda states [...] "As certain religions of {{the world}} say that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not believe in himself is an atheist.

He was also charged with threatening to kill an AAIB official involved in {{the investigation into the}} accident. In April 2011, the pilot was found guilty of making death threats. The judge said that the defendant was [...] "clearly extremely disturbed" [...] at the time the offences happened, adding [...] "He is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> need help.

2500|$|For example, in {{the rural}} part of Haryana state in India the [...] "No Toilet, No Bride" [...] or [...] "No loo, no [...] "I do"" [...] slogans {{has been used to}} promote toilets (usually pour flush pit latrine toilets) by {{encouraging}} women to refuse to marry <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not own a toilet. The important initiative of the Indian government since 2014 called the [...] "Clean India Mission" [...] is using various approaches such as the one mentioned above in the different states of India to encourage behavior change with regards to toilet use.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2013 pit latrines {{are used}} by an {{estimated}} 1.77 billion people. This is mostly {{in the developing world}} as well as in rural and wilderness areas. In 2011 about 2.5 billion people did not have access to a proper toilet and one billion resort to open defecation in their surroundings. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the poorest access to toilets. In developing countries the cost of a simple pit toilet is typically between 25 and 60 USD. Ongoing maintenance costs are between 1.5 and 4 USD per person per year which are often not taken into consideration. In some states of India the [...] "No Toilet, No Bride" [...] campaign has been used in rural areas to promote toilets by encouraging women to refuse to marry <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not own a toilet. This type of campaign is embedded in other change efforts promoted by the Indian government in the Clean India Mission.|$|E
2500|$|Season two {{opens with}} Diego in Monterey, the colonial capital, where privately {{collected}} money {{to bring a}} supply ship to California is consistently diverted to a gang of bandits. Diego stays to investigate, both as himself and as Zorro, and becomes interested in Ana Maria Verdugo, {{the daughter of the}} man organizing the effort. Once Zorro defeats the thieves, he enters into a rivalry with his old friend Ricardo del Amo, a practical joker who is also interested in Ana Maria. Ana Maria in turn is in love with Zorro. While in Monterey, Zorro and Sergeant Demetrio López García also get involved in a dispute between the peons and a repressive Lieutenant Governor. Diego {{is on the verge of}} giving up his mask to marry Ana Maria, but Don Alejandro talks him out of it. Zorro (and Diego) says goodbye to Ana Maria and returns to Los Angeles, where he gets involved in a series of shorter adventures. In one three episode story arc, guest starring Annette Funicello, Zorro must solve the mystery of Anita Cabrillo's father, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not seem to exist. Other storylines late in the series involve Diego's never-do-well uncle (Cesar Romero), a plot against the governor of California, an encounter with an American [...] "mountain man" [...] (Jeff York, reprising a role from The Saga of Andy Burnett), and outwitting a greedy emissary from Spain.|$|E

The Rabbis confronted Rava, saying [...] "hiding of the face" [...] and [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] did not apply to Rava. Rava asked the Rabbis whether they knew how much he was forced to send {{secretly}} to the Court of King Shapur of Persia. Even so, the Rabbis directed their eyes upon Rava in suspicion. Meanwhile, the Court of King Shapur sent men who seized Rava's property. Rava then said that this bore out what Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel taught, that wherever the Rabbis direct their eyes in suspicion, either death or poverty follows. Interpreting [...] "I will hide My face," [...] Rava taught that God said although God would hide God's face from them, God would nonetheless speak to them in a dream. Rav Joseph taught that God's hand is nonetheless stretched over us to protect us, as [...] says, [...] "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania was once at the Roman emperor Hadrian's court, when an unbeliever gestured to Rabbi Joshua in sign language that the Jewish people was a people from whom their God had turned His face. Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania gestured in reply that God's hand was stretched over the Jewish people. Emperor Hadrian asked Rabbi Joshua what unbeliever had said. Rabbi Joshua told the emperor what unbeliever had said and what Rabbi Joshua had replied. They then asked the unbeliever what he had said, and he told them. And then they asked what Rabbi Joshua had replied, and the unbeliever did not know. They decreed that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not understand what he is being shown by gesture should hold converse in signs before the emperor, and they led him forth and executed him for his disrespect to the emperor.|$|E
