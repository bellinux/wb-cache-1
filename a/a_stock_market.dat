5|$|The Beatles {{entered into}} a {{publishing}} agreement with Dick James Music (DJM), so James set up a company called Northern Songs. James and his financial partner and accountant, Charles Silver, would each receive 25 per cent of the shares. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, with Epstein receiving the remaining 10 per cent. The Beatles' PRS income increased rapidly, so Epstein asked Isherwood to devise a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would owe. Isherwood suggested <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> flotation for Northern Songs. He also suggested to Epstein that during the flotation Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near Isherwood's own in Esher. Lennon, Harrison and Starr agreed, while Epstein and McCartney remained in London.|$|E
5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> downturn and MITS was {{only able to}} sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E

He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after {{catching}} her fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} returns in the Chinese <b>A</b> and B <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> for {{evidence}} of calendar anomalies. We find that both cultural and structural (segmentation) factors {{play an important role}} in influencing the pricing of both A- and B-shares in China. There is some evidence of a February turn-of-the-year effect, partly owing to the timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year (CNY); and the holiday effect around the CNY period is stronger and more persistent compared with the other public holidays. The segmentation between the two markets is apparent in the day-of-the-week effect, where B <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> tend to post significant negative returns on Tuesdays, corresponding with overnight developments in the United States, while significant negative returns are observed on Mondays in the <b>A</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Investment strategies based on some of these calendar anomalies, and allowing for transaction costs, suggest that the <b>A</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> tend to offer more economically significant returns. <b>Stock</b> markets;stock <b>market,</b> statistics, standard deviation, stock returns, portfolio investment, financial economics, stock exchanges, <b>stock</b> exchange, financial <b>markets,</b> significance levels, <b>stock</b> prices, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices, research method, equations, anova, futures markets, dummy variables, standard deviations, stock price, significance level, arithmetic, dummy variable, stock share, stock index, financial systems, outlier, international financial markets, random walk, cash flows, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index, sample sizes, equity <b>markets,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> volatility, autocorrelation, local equation, survey, polynomial, bond, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> movements, time series, outliers, statistical test, new york stock exchange...|$|R
