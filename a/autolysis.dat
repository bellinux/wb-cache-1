5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through <b>autolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Autolytic {{debridement}} {{is the use}} of moist dressings {{to promote}} <b>autolysis</b> with the body's own enzymes and white blood cells. It is a slow process, but mostly painless, and is most effective in individuals with a properly functioning immune system.|$|E
25|$|Proteases, being {{themselves}} proteins, are cleaved {{by other}} protease molecules, sometimes {{of the same}} variety. This acts {{as a method of}} regulation of protease activity. Some proteases are less active after <b>autolysis</b> (e.g. TEV protease) whilst others are more active (e.g. trypsinogen).|$|E
25|$|Trypsin {{should be}} stored at very cold {{temperatures}} (between 20°C and 80°C) to prevent <b>autolysis,</b> which {{may also be}} impeded by storage of trypsin at pH 3 or by using trypsin modified by reductive methylation. When the pH is adjusted back to pH 8, activity returns.|$|E
25|$|Some O. oeni strains can use {{fructose}} {{to create}} mannitol (which {{can lead to}} wine fault known as mannitol taint), while many other strains can break down the amino acid arginine (which can {{be present in the}} wine that is resting on the lees after fermentation from the <b>autolysis</b> of dead yeast cells) into ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Following amputation, most annelids {{are capable}} of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to {{infection}} prevention. In certain species, like Limnodrilus, <b>autolysis</b> can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.|$|E
25|$|While some winemakers will {{inoculate}} their LAB with {{nutrients that}} include nitrogen, {{most of the}} nutrients needed for MLF come from the breakdown (or <b>autolysis)</b> of the dead yeast cells. Additionally, most bacteria used in MLF {{have the ability to}} produce extracellular protease enzymes that can also breakdown larger peptide chains into their base amino acid residues that can then be used for metabolism.|$|E
25|$|However, TEV {{protease}} {{does have}} limitations as a biochemical tool. It {{is prone to}} deactivation by self-cleavage (<b>autolysis),</b> though this can be abolished through a single S219V mutation in the internal cleavage site. The protease expressed alone is also poorly soluble, however several {{attempts have been made}} to improve its solubility through directed evolution and computational design. It has also been shown that expression can be improved by fusion to maltose binding protein (MBP) which acts a solubility enhancing partner.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{advantages}} for postalcoholic fermentation answer the disadvantages of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts). Also, the advantage is seen of the lees being a nutrient source through the <b>autolysis</b> of the dead yeast cells, though that nutrient source {{may not always be}} enough to ensure MLF runs successfully to completion. Conversely, many of the disadvantages of late inoculation are the absence of {{the advantages}} that come from early inoculation (higher temperatures, potentially quicker completion, etc.).|$|E
25|$|After obtaining {{an alcohol}} content {{of at least}} 12 percent by volume, the mead {{undergoes}} racking prior to ageing. Leaving the pitched wort on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's organoleptic properties because of yeast <b>autolysis.</b> Ageing (maturing) and siphoning (decantation) is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from {{taking place in the}} lees. During ageing, it is possible to carry out pasteurisation and filtration. This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right organoleptic properties.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{following}} {{the disruption of}} British Marmite imports after World WarI and prior {{to the introduction of}} Vegemite, Callister's employer, the Australian company Fred Walker & Co., gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries. Callister had been hired by the chairman Fred Walker. Vegemite was registered as a trademark in Australia that same year. Callister used <b>autolysis</b> to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the Carlton & United brewery. Concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with salt, celery and onion extracts formed a sticky black paste.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{benefits}} associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the <b>autolysis</b> of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and protein stability, help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins.|$|E
25|$|When yeast cells die, they sink to {{the bottom}} of the {{fermentation}} vessel where they combine with insoluble tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the <b>autolysis</b> (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|E
25|$|Maturing {{can be done}} in a vat. It takes {{little time}} to clarify and to prepare the {{packaging}} (bottling or Bag-In-Box) but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which digests itself (<b>autolysis)</b> giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called Bâtonnage or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees {{at the bottom of the}} barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a Goût de réduit (Reduced taste) due to the activity of reductase sulphite from the yeast. This operation {{can be done in}} vats, as in Muscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.|$|E
500|$|The {{assembly}} of the proteasome is a complex process due {{to the number of}} subunits that must associate to form an active complex. The β subunits are synthesized with N-terminal [...] "propeptides" [...] that are post-translationally modified during the {{assembly of}} the 20S particle to expose the proteolytic active site. The 20S particle is assembled from two half-proteasomes, each of which consists of a seven-membered pro-β ring attached to a seven-membered α ring. The association of the β rings of the two half-proteasomes triggers threonine-dependent <b>autolysis</b> of the propeptides to expose the active site. These β interactions are mediated mainly by salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions between conserved alpha helices whose disruption by mutation damages the proteasome's ability to assemble. The {{assembly of the}} half-proteasomes, in turn, is initiated by the assembly of the α subunits into their heptameric ring, forming a template for the association of the corresponding pro-β ring. The assembly of α subunits has not been characterized.|$|E
2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae can {{assimilate}} nitrogen {{from both}} inorganic (ammonia and ammonium) and organic forms (amino acids, particularly arginine). As yeast cells die, enzymes within the cells begin autolyzing by {{breaking down the}} cell, including the amino acids. This <b>autolysis</b> of the cell provides an available nitrogen source for the still-fermenting and viable yeast cells. However, this <b>autolysis</b> can also release sulfur-link compounds (such as the breakdown of amino acid cysteine) which can combine with other molecules and react with alcohol to create volatile thiols that can contribute to a [...] "stinky fermentation" [...] or later development into various wine faults.|$|E
2500|$|Necrosis (from the Greek νέκρωσις [...] "death, {{the stage}} of dying, the act of killing" [...] from [...] "dead") {{is a form of}} cell injury which results in the {{premature}} death of cells in living tissue by <b>autolysis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{diversity}} in the Muscat family, one common trait {{that can be seen}} in most all Muscat members is the characteristic floral, [...] "grapey" [...] aroma note that is caused by the high concentration of monoterpenes in the grapes. More than 40 different monoterpenes have been discovered in Muscat grapes (as well as in other aromatic varieties like Riesling and Gewürztraminer); these include citronellol, geraniol, linalool and nerol. This characteristic [...] "musk" [...] aroma can be best observed in light bodied, low alcohol wines such as Moscato Asti which have not had their bouquet heavily influenced by other winemaking techniques like oak aging, <b>autolysis</b> with yeast, malolactic fermentation or fortification.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{presence}} of ethyl carbamate is not a sensory wine fault, the compound is a suspected carcinogen which is subjected to regulation in many countries. The compound is produced from the degradation of the amino acid arginine which is present in both grape must and released in the wine through the <b>autolysis</b> of dead yeast cells. While the use of urea {{as a source of}} yeast assimilable nitrogen (no longer legal in most countries) was {{the most common cause of}} ethyl carbamate in wine, both O. oeni and L. buchneri have been known to produce carbamyl phosphate and citrulline which can be precursors to ethyl carbamate formation. L. hilgardii, one of the [...] "ferocious Lactobacillus" [...] species, has also been suspected of contributing to ethyl carbamate production. In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has established a voluntary target limit of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15µg/l for table wines and less than 60µg/l for dessert wines.|$|E
2500|$|The grape variety used {{to produce}} Muscadet, Melon de Bourgogne, is a {{relatively}} neutral grape. Winemaking techniques have evolved {{in the region to}} adapt to the grape's limitation and bring out more flavor and complexity. The most well-known of these techniques is sur lie aging, where the wine stays in contact with the dead yeast cells left over after fermentation (the lees). The technique was discovered, almost accidentally, in the early 20th century. Traditionally Muscadet producers would set aside a barrel of wine for special occasions, such as a family wedding. This [...] "honeymoon barrel", as it became known, would take on more flavor and texture due to its contact with the lees. Through this process, <b>autolysis</b> occurs which contributes to a creamy mouthfeel that may make the wine seem to have a fuller body. The release of enzymes during this process inhibits oxidation which may also improve the aging potential of the wine. During this process, the wine is usually not racked for several months. While in many wines, the lack of racking could have the undesired consequences of developing off flavors or other wine faults. However, the relative neutrality of the Melon de Bourgogne grape works in the favor of the Muscadet wine and poses minimal risk to developing off flavors.|$|E
50|$|In {{the making}} of {{fermented}} beverages, <b>autolysis</b> can occur when the must or wort is left on the lees for a long time.In beer brewing, <b>autolysis</b> causes undesired off-flavors. <b>Autolysis</b> in winemaking is often undesirable, {{but in the case}} of the best Champagnes it is a vital component in creating flavor and mouth feel.|$|E
50|$|Ancient Roman writers, such as Marcus Porcius Cato, {{observed}} that wine {{that was left}} on its lees (or sediment as they knew it) exhibited different characteristics than wine that was quickly separated from its sediment. While the Romans {{did not understand the}} full chemical process or details behind the <b>autolysis</b> that took place, they were able to perceive the results of this <b>autolysis</b> in the creamy mouthfeel, reduced astringency and unique flavors and aromas that developed. With modern day understanding of <b>autolysis,</b> winemaking in the Champagne have strict regulation regarding the time Champagne must spend in contact with its lees in order to receive some benefit from <b>autolysis.</b> Under Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations, wines from Champagne cannot legally be sold until it has gone through <b>autolysis</b> in the bottle for at least 15 months with non-vintage Champagne. Vintage Champagne must have a minimum of 3 years aging with some Champagne houses extending the time for <b>autolysis</b> to nearly 7 years.|$|E
50|$|Autolytic cell {{destruction}} is uncommon in living adult organisms and usually occurs in injured cells and dying tissue. <b>Autolysis</b> is {{initiated by the}} cells' lysosomes releasing digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm. These enzymes are released due to the cessation of active processes in the cell, not as an active process. In other words, though <b>autolysis</b> resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells, the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed and as the synonym self-digestion of <b>autolysis</b> seems to imply. <b>Autolysis</b> of individual cell organelles can be lessened if the organelle is stored in ice-cold isotonic buffer after cell fractionation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first stage}} is <b>autolysis,</b> more {{commonly}} known as self-digestion, during which the body's cells are destroyed through the action of their own digestive enzymes. However, these enzymes are released into the cells because of active processes ceasing in the cells, not as an active process. In other words, though <b>autolysis</b> resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells, the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed in popular literature and as the synonym of <b>autolysis</b> self-digestion seems to imply. As a result of <b>autolysis,</b> liquid is created that gets between the layers of skin and makes the skin peel off. During this stage, flies (when present) start to lay eggs in the openings of the body: eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, open wounds, and other orifices. Hatched larvae, (maggots) of blowflies, subsequently get under the skin and start to eat the body.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autolysis</b> in {{winemaking}} {{relates to}} the complex chemical reactions that take place when a wine spends time {{in contact with the}} lees, or dead yeast cells, after fermentation. While for some wines <b>autolysis</b> is undesirable, it is a vital component in shaping the flavors and mouth feel associated with premium Champagne production. The practice of leaving a wine to age on its lees (or sur lie aging) has a long history in winemaking dating back to Roman winemaking. The chemical process and details of <b>autolysis</b> were not originally understood but the positive effects of a creamy mouthfeel, breadlike and floral aroma, as well as reduced astringency were noticed early on.|$|E
