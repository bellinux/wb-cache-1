Studies have opened new avenues for better utilization of anaerobic digestate after improved composting using beneficial microorganisms, the products of which could be directly utilized in the farms for improving soil organic content (Zeng et al. 2016).

When the start-up was finished, the removal rate of COD by the reactor was about 80 %. In the zone I, biogas mainly revealed carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen (H 2). Methane was the main component in the zone 2 which ranged from 53 % to 59 % with an average of 55 %. The methane content in biogas increased from the zone I to II.

The sealing was also effective due to ferric hydroxide precipitation in sand after percolation of ferrous-containing solution produced from iron ore and cellulose by the community of <b>acidogenic</b> and iron-reducing <b>bacteria.</b> These treatments of sand can decrease its hydraulic conductivity from the level of 10 − 4  m/s to the level of 10 − 8  m/s, which is an acceptable level for the aquaculture ponds. The cost of this sealing, especially when the local sources of calcium chloride brain or low grade iron (hydr) oxides of iron ore are applied, could be several times lower than any other known methods of the sand sealing, and could be used in aquaculture practice for the construction of fish, prawns, or algae ponds in sand of the arid deserts...|$|R
40|$|Background. The mouth {{supports}} a diverse microbiota which exists as structurally-organised biofilms on mucosal and dental surfaces. The oral microbiota provides major {{benefits to the}} host including: (a) colonisation resistance, (b) down-regulation of potentially damaging host inflammatory responses, and (c) active contributions to the normal development of the physiology of the mouth and the host defences. Highlight. Generally, these communities live in harmony (symbiosis) with the host but, on occasions, this symbiotic relationship breaks down and disease occurs (dysbiosis). Disease is associated with shifts {{in the balance of}} the oral microbiota driven by changes in the local environment. These changes include more regular conditions of low pH in the biofilm, {{as a result of an}} altered diet or reduced saliva flow, thereby favouring the growth and metabolism of <b>acidogenic</b> and acid-tolerating <b>bacteria,</b> at the expense of beneficial oral micro-organisms, and increasing the risk of dental caries. The host mounts an inflammatory response if biofilm accumulates around the gingivae beyond levels compatible with health. If this fails to reduce the biomass, the altered environment selects for increased proportions of obligately anaerobic and proteolytic species that can subvert the host response leading, ultimately, to pocket formation and loss of attachment. Conclusion. An appreciation of ecological principles can lead to new strategies for treatment by identifying and removing the factors that drive dysbiosis, while actively supporting the growth of the natural oral microbiota. Also, the beneficial activities of the resident oral microbiota are retained and the risk of dysbiosis is reduced...|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: Mutans streptococci, bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli are <b>acidogenic</b> and aciduric <b>bacteria</b> {{which may}} be {{associated}} with early childhood caries (ECC). This study aimed to analyze the bacterial composition of four cariogenic microorganisms, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Bifidobacterium spp., and Lactobacillus spp. in the saliva of Chinese preschool children and to assess the association of the bacterial burden with the caries status. Materials and methods: A total of 109 saliva samples were collected from 36 children with ECC and 73 caries-free (CF) children aged 2 – 4 years. A questionnaire was used to evaluate other caries risk factors such as dietary habits and oral hygiene practice. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the presence and loads of the four microorganisms. Pearson's correlation test was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the World Health Organization caries diagnostic criteria dmft/dmfs index scores and saliva levels of the selected bacteria. Results: The prevalence of S. mutans and S. sobrinus in children with ECC was 88. 9 % and 19. 4 %, respectively, whereas the prevalence in CF children was 76. 7 % and 4. 1 %, respectively. The saliva levels of S. mutans and S. sobrinus in children with ECC were significantly higher than in CF children (P =  0. 004 and P =  0. 007, respectively) and positively correlated with dmft/dmfs index scores (r =  0. 321 / 0. 316 and r =  0. 271 / 0. 245, respectively). An association was found between children with caries-active lesions and the frequency of sugar consumption (P =  0. 004). No significant difference in the presence and load of Bifidobacterium spp. or Lactobacillus spp. were found between the two groups. Conclusion: S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and sugar consumption appear to be associated with caries status in the studied population, which might be useful for caries screening in Chinese preschool children...|$|R

Nevertheless, poor glycemic control, xerostomia and repeated food intake may disrupt the microbial homeostasis of plaque and increase the incidence of caries due to <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Taylor 2004; Marsh 2009).|$|E
40|$|A glucose-based {{wastewater}} was efficiently degradaded by <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> with a glucose {{removal efficiency}} close to 90 %, and although a distinctive granular structure {{could not be}} observed, fluffy conglomerates developed in an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Subsequently, the pre-acidification of the wastewater promoted the granulation process. An enrichment in methanogenic bacteria was observed on the microscope and was confirmed {{by an increase in}} the specific methanogenic activity from 0. 1 up to 0. 5 kgCOD/kgVSS. day. Such dynamics of microbial communities was also verified through changes in the polysaccharide and protein content, {{as well as in the}} electrophoretic mobility of the biomass.

40|$|Abstract}A novel {{anaerobic}} treatment system, the anaerobic migrating blanket reactor (AMBR), was developed after completing a parallel study with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) processes. Using sucrose {{as the main}} component of a synthetic wastewater, the AMBR achieved a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of 30 g. l 1. day 1 at a 12 -h hydraulic retention time (HRT). This resulted in a standard methane production rate (SMPR) of 6. 5 l. l 1. day 1 and an average methane-based COD (MCOD) removal efficiency of 62. 2 %. A key element in granular biomass formation was migration of the biomass blanket through the reactor. Although a carbohydrate-rich wastewater was used, no separate pre-acidification was required for the AMBR, because of high mixing intensities and wash out of <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In contrast, the absence of pre-acidification created ‘‘bulking’ ’ problems (caused by abundant <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> at the surface of granules) in a UASB reactor, operated under conditions {{similar to that of the}} AMBR. As a result, a maximum COD loading rate and SMPR of 21 g. l 1. day 1 and 4. 9 l. l 1. day 1 were achieved, respectively, for the UASB reactor at a 12 -h HRT. These values were 18 g. l 1. day 1 and 3. 7 l. l 1. day 1, respectively, for an ASBR at a 12 -h HRT. Hence, the performance of the AMBR in treating a carbohydrate-rich wastewater was found to be superior in terms of maximum loading rate and SMPR. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|A biofilm {{containing}} both hydrolytic fermentative {{bacteria and}} <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (including acetogenic and acetoclastic bacteria) {{was developed for}} the treatment of plastic wastes in a two-phase, batch digester. The biotransformation and further degradation were electrochemically observed. It was found that the organic wastes were initially fermented in a single-phase (i. e. liquid phase) digester, where it entirely obeyed microbial growth kinetics in accumulating acetate. As the carbonates produced were vaporised, the single-phase became a two-phase fermentation (gas and liquid) accumulating volatile fatty acids (VFAs), where it obeyed a proton driving force based on Le Chatelier’s principle. Interestingly, as the digester was depressurised to the saturated vapour pressure of water, the accumulated VFAs were rapidly transformed into acetone via butanol, so that the VFAs forms were not observable. It was found that in extreme conditions, the organic feeds were converted and stored into acetone, via butanol...|$|E
40|$|A {{structured}} {{model of}} the anaerobic degradation process, incorporating dynamic equations for the description of a single-stage high-rate anaerobic reactor was validated by comparing its predictions with previously reported experimental data. This data came from two different laboratory-scale reactors and a pilot-scale reactor. With the manipulation of key model parameters, significant improvements in the fit of the model to the experimental data were possible. This study was {{able to show that}} the production and consumption of lactic acid, and the moderate hydrogen inhibition and regulation of the acidic products of the <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> can be successfully modelled. Insufficient experimental data were available to draw conclusions as to the importance of product inhibition in anaerobic reactors, while the need to use deterministic models to account for pH inhibition highlighted the need to develop mechanistic models able to reflect the pH inhibited behaviour of the major anaerobic groups present in the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{combination}} of photosynthetic bacteria along with anaerobic <b>acidogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{is an ideal}} option for efficient hydrogen production. In the present study, the optimum concentration of substrates {{for the growth of}} Rhodobacter sphaeroides was found by response surface methodology. The optimum {{combination of}} three individual fatty acids was determined by Box Behnken design. Increase of volatile fatty acid concentration decreased the growth. Combination of sodium acetate and sodium propionate was most significant for the growth of the organism. The results showed that a maximum biomass concentration of 0. 916 g/l was obtained when the concentrations of acetate, propionate and butyrate were 0. 73 g/l, 0. 99 g/l and 0. 799 g/l, respectively. The growth was studied under an optimum concentration of volatile fatty acids and at a light intensity of 3000 lux, initial pH of 7 and a temperature of 35 ˚C. The maximum biomass concentration of 0. 92 g/l was obtained which verified the practicability of this optimization...|$|E
