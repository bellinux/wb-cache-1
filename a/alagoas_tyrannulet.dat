40|$|Abstract. The forests {{north of}} the São Francisco River, in northeastern Brazil, conform a centre of {{endemism}} for plants and animals. Currently only 5 % of its original forest cover is left, following 500 years of human colonisation. Avian endemism is high, and during the 1980 s four birds were described from these forests, Alagoas Foliage-gleaner Philydor novaesi, Orange-bellied Antwren Terenura sicki, Alagoas Antwren Myrmotherula snowi and <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Tyrannulet</b> Phylloscartes ceciliae. Their type locality, Murici Ecological Station, in the coastal mountains of Alagoas state, was the only site where the four species were known to occur together, and {{became the focus of}} much attention from conservation organisations. We here report on recent surveys at Reserva Privada do Patrimônio Natural Frei Caneca, in the mountains of Pernambuco state, which found these 4 species and 27 other threatened and endemic birds, and a yet undescribed taxon. We propose that more thorough surveys are needed in the reserve and its vicinity, to locate fragments of suitable forest for these species. These should be regarded within a management plan for the reserve (including research and monitoring), and such work should be expanded to a regional level. An educational programme focusing on the values of these forests and the negative impacts of human activities is needed very much...|$|E
