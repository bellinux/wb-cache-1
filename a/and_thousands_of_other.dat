Trade {{between the two}} nations had been totally disrupted and the border closed, damaging the economies of both nations and threatening the future of the Central American Common Market (CACM). Up to 2,000 people, the majority Honduran civilians, had been killed, <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Hondurans in the border area had been made homeless.

The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library much easier for both library staff and users.

25|$|Starting in December 2010, {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} plans for two permanent gallery spaces: for the Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and for the injustices experienced by the Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Organizations like the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC), Canadians for Genocide Education, the German-Canadian Congress, the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (UCCLA) <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Canadians have been protesting this perceived elevation of the suffering {{of one or two}} communities above all others.

With regard to atrocities, other advocacy groups have also chimed in to protest a perceived over-emphasis on the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Despite Boyle's efforts, the {{political}} pressure exerted by the black-lung miners {{was effective in}} the long run. Media images of hacking, dying miners -- most of them young men in their 30s and 40s -- caused a public outcry. Throughout the lobbying effort for the bill, Miller accused UMWA of ignoring rank-and-file miners' needs. This undercut Boyle's power, which rested on his claim that he alone represented the legitimate concerns of mine workers. On February 18, 1969, Miller <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> West Virginia miners launched a 23-day wildcat strike to demand enactment of the black-lung bill. The strike led the legislature to pass the bill, {{which was the first}} of its kind in the U.S.|$|E

Halberstam grew very weak from this difficult work. When he collapsed under his burden, he was beaten. He refused to work at all on Shabbat, which brought on more beatings. Finally, his friends persuaded the camp managers to give him to the job of camp custodian, allowing him to sweep and tidy the barracks while engaging in prayer the entire day.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{was trying}} new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly {{concerned}} with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country.

In that case, friends, do what I <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Americans have done—declare the war over."—one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November.

500|$|Many Northern cities {{also had}} de facto {{segregation}} policies, {{which resulted in}} a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built {{since the turn of the}} century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped stimulate activism among African-American parents like Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Browns principles. Mallory <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first freedom schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools.

Part of the original colophons, the [...] "royal memorial" [...] reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum.

Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: [...] "Lord bless the baron Vassak" [...] and again on the upper band of the frame around the Raising of Lazarus: [...] "Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458. Prince Vassak was sent to Cairo by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon <b>and</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> hostages captured after the disastrous Battle of Mari.
