25|$|For an {{interest-bearing}} security, {{coupon rate}} is {{the ratio of}} the <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> amount (the coupon paid per year) per unit of par value, whereas current yield is {{the ratio of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> divided by its current market price. Yield to maturity is a bond's expected internal rate of return, assuming it will be held to maturity, that is, the discount rate which equates all remaining cash flows to the investor (all remaining coupons and repayment of the par value at maturity) with the current market price.|$|E
50|$|The first {{source of}} return in a {{fixed-income}} portfolio is {{that due to}} interest. The majority of securities will pay a regular coupon, and this is paid irrespective {{of what happens in}} the marketplace (ignoring defaults and similar catastrophes). For instance, a bond paying a 10% <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> will always pay 10% of its face value to the owner each year, even if there is no change in market conditions.|$|E
5000|$|For example, suppose an {{investor}} buys $10,000 par {{value of a}} US dollar bond, which pays coupons twice a year, and that the bond's simple <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> rate is 6 percent per year. This means that every 6 months, the issuer pays the holder of the bond a coupon of 3 dollars per 100 dollars par value. At the end of 6 months, the issuer pays the holder: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} where the only {{discount}} rate one has is not a zero-rate (neither taken from a zero-coupon bond nor converted from a swap rate to a zero-rate through bootstrapping) but an annually-compounded rate (for example if the benchmark is a US Treasury bond with <b>annual</b> <b>coupons)</b> and one only has its yield to maturity, one would use an annually-compounded discount factor: ...|$|R
500|$|The CCAF filed {{a lengthy}} brief in Missouri in May 2011 {{challenging}} a settlement which gave lawyers who sued A.G. Edwards $21 million in fees for negotiating {{an agreement that}} provided a total of $6 million for some customers and three <b>annual</b> <b>coupons</b> valued at $8.22 apiece for the rest. St. Louis Judge Angela T. Quigless of the Missouri Court of Appeals rejected the case, ruling that “in cases involving complex litigation or in the class action context, a one-third contingent fee award is not unreasonable.” ...|$|R
40|$|In January 1997, Winterthur Insurance, {{together}} with Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), issued the first listed CAT bond. The <b>annual</b> "WINCAT 0 <b>coupons</b> of this three-year convertible bond are knocked out if any single storm event damages more than 6, 000 vehicles insured by Winterthur Insurance in Switzerland. This {{was a completely}} new way of securing insurance risks. The main intention was to test the Swiss capital market for such products and to make investors acquainted with them. Thereby Winterthur, {{together with}} CSFB, set new standards in product transparency, fairness of pricing and investor education by making the historical data available via internet and by publishing a special brochure (CSFB (1997)), where the pricing and the mathematical modelling are described in detail. This is also a prerequisite to enable a scientific discussion on pricing aspects of such new financial products. The developers of the bond are therefore grateful to Mr. Schmock for this valuable scientific contribution which {{can be seen as}} a thorough and profound statistical analysis on the knock-out probability for the purpose of quantifying the model uncertainty. In Section 2 we briefly summarize the whole pricing of the bond at the issue date and show that there were several risk premium elements in this pricing where the conservative estimation of the knock-out probability was just one of them. In Section 3 we consider the modelling of low frequency risks from a practitioner's standpoint and formulate some requirements from practice. In Section 4 we make some further comments on the modelling of the Wincat data. Section 5 is a short summar...|$|R
50|$|For other bonds, {{such as in}} {{the case}} of TIPS, the {{underlying}} principal of the bond changes, which results in a higher interest payment when multiplied by the same rate. For example, if the <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> of the bond were 5% and the underlying principal of the bond were 100 units, the annual payment would be 5 units. If the inflation index increased by 10%, the principal of the bond would increase to 110 units. The coupon rate would remain at 5%, resulting in an interest payment of 110 x 5% = 5.5 units.|$|E
5000|$|The first Eurobonds {{were issued}} in 1963 by Italian {{motorway}} network Autostrade, who issued 60,000 bearer bonds at {{a value of}} US$250 each for a fifteen-year loan of US$15m, paying an <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> of 5.5%. The issue was arranged by London bankers S. G. Warburg. and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Allen & Overy, one of London's Magic Circle of law firms, were the lawyers on the transaction.Their conception was largely a reaction against the imposition of the Interest Equalization Tax in the United States. [...] The goal of the tax was to reduce the US balance-of-payment deficit by reducing American demand for foreign securities. Americans could bypass the costly tax and Europeans could keep open access to US capital.|$|E
40|$|Conference Name: 2 nd International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering. Conference Address: Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:JUL 24 - 26, 2009. Catastrophe bond (CAT bond) {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{instruments}} to transfer catastrophic risk into the capital market around the whole world. And the pricing theories are developed recently. For earthquake disaster, a pricing model, base on engineering seismic risk assessment, is given. The occurring probability of a defined earthquake catastrophe, estimated by seismic risk assessment method, is adopted as an input. Some factors, like yields and proportion of reinvestment, principal protected ratio, issuance fee, circulation, maturity period, claim payments of insurers and reinsurers, are designed. The cash flows of earthquake insurance premium in complete and incomplete markets are described by Geometric Brownian Motion and Jump-Diffusion processes respectively. The <b>annual</b> <b>coupon</b> rate of a CAT bond is calculated under the equilibrium between the incomes of investors and issuers. The feasibility of the model is represented by a production...|$|E
