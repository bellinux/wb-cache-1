40|$|<b>Antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> {{antibodies}} were purified {{from the}} serum {{of a patient}} with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Using hybridoma technology, we produced several mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against idiotypic determinants on these <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies. One of these monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies, 3 I, an IgG 2 a Kappa, was extensively characterized. 3 I {{is believed to be}} directed against an idiotypic determinant because (i) its reactivity with <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies is not inhibited by a large excess of pooled human serum, (ii) it reacts with F(ab') 2 fragments of <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies, and (iii) it reacts with <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies of all IgG subclasses. 3 I is not directed against the antigen binding site in that native DNA and 3 I do not compete for binding to <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies. Eight of nine sera containing <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> activity as determined by the Millipore filter assay reacted with 3 I in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. These findings suggest that <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies from nonrelated patients with systemic lupus erythematosus share a common idiotype...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{differences}} in both specificity and avidity of anti-DNA antibodies {{were observed in}} the sera of groups of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus glomerulonephritis, active systemic lupus erythematosus without nephritis, and in IgG eluates obtained by DNAase digestion of isolated glomeruli from glomerulonephritic kidneys. With methylated albumin-kieselguhr fractionated 3 H-HeLa DNA {{as a source of}} native or single-strand DNA antigen in a modified Farr assay, an increased level of antibody to native DNA was associated with active systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly active nephritis. The avidity of <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> estimated from plots of the reciprocals of bound and free antigen according to the Sips distribution formula was significanly lower in active glomerulonephritis sera than in sera from patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus without nephritis. However, <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> of uniformly high avidity was found in the glomerular eluates. Avidity of single-strand DNA antibodies did not differ in the various patient groups. The data stronly supprot a major role for high avidity antinative-DNA in DNA/antiDNA immune complex-induced glomerular injury in systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|E
40|$|Double-stranded DNA {{fragments}} of varying sizes were isolated and tested for binding to {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies. Fragments of 20 - 25, 40 - 50, 90 - 110, and 160 - 180 base pairs (bp), along with intermediate-size pieces were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis of a limited micrococcal nuclease digest of calf thymus DNA. Larger helical polynucleotides of 160 - 200, 380, 600 - 1, 000, and 1, 200 bp were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis of DNA from chicken erythrocyte nucleosomes and oligonucleosomes. The fragments behaved as base-paired structures as tested by thermal denaturation, resistance to S 1 nuclease, and serological assays with antibodies to native or denatured DNA. At a concentration of 0. 27 muM, {{fragments of}} 20 - 25 bp were able to react with two SLE sera in competition with native DNA. With these and two other sera, DNA of 40 - 50 bp was a much more effective competitor. One serum required DNA greater than 180 bp for competition in the concentration range tested. Denatured fragments were much less effective than native fragments. The results emphasize the heterogeneity of SLE <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies, confirm that secondary structure of the antigen is important for specific binding to these antibodies, and support the suggestion that bivalent binding to one molecule may be important for high functional affinity...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient who}} {{developed}} a multisystem involvement of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) after 9 years of procainamide therapy, during which time he ingested enormous amounts of the drug, is described. The patient first suffered from recurrent episodes of pleuritis and arthritis, after which he developed a characteristic SLE nephritis associated {{with a high level}} of <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies and a low level of complement. He finally died from a complication of a nonbacterial endocarditis. Autopsy showed polyserositis and typical deposits of electron-dense material on the glomerular basement membrane, and confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Libman-Sacks endocarditis. The possibility that procainamide-induced SLE might have all the clinical, immunological, and pathological features of spontaneous SLE, especially in patients exposed to large doses of the drug for many years, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} significance of <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies {{as measured by}} the Farr test was investigated in 10 patients with the articular features of rheumatoid arthritis. 5 of these patients also satisfied criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and might be classified as rheumatoid/lupus overlap syndromes or as rheumatoids with systemic complications. None had evidence of renal disease and 3 of the 5 had Sjgøren's syndrome. The sixth patient had aggressive peripheral arthritis, alopecia, and Sjøgren's syndrome and developed anti-DNA antibodies after treatment with penicillamine. All of the 4 rheumatoid patients with no clinical features typical of SLE had some special disease feature. The first had subclinical liver disease and the other 3 had Sjøgren's syndrome in addition to localized vasculitic skin ulceration (2) and pulmonary fibrosis (1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of viruses was sought in {{a colony of}} dogs bred from parents with systemic lupus crythematosus (SLE). Cell-free filtrates prepared from the spleens of these animals were injected into newborn dogs, mice, and rats. The canine recipients developed antinuclear antibody (ANA) and positive lupus erythematosus (LE) cell tests: ANA and, in some cases, <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies were produced by the murine recipients: no abnormalities were detected in the rats. Serial passage of spleen cells or cell-free filtrates of spleen tissue in syngeneic mice reduced the time required for appearance of ANA from 9 to 4 mo. Some murine recipients of the canine filtrate developed malignant lymphomas. Murine leukemia viruses were identified in these tumors by electron microscopic, virologic, and serologic technics. These neoplasms, but not other tumors known to contain murine leukemia viruses, {{were associated with the}} production of ANA. Puppies inoculated with the canine filtrate-induced mouse lymphoma developed ANA and positive LE cell tests within 4 mo...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to determine {{the basis for the}} strong competitive reaction of denatured DNA with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <b>antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies. Secondary structure in denatured DNA was reflected in hyperchromicity upon heating and in multiphase kinetics of its digestion by S 1 nuclease. Partial digestion by S 1 nuclease completely eliminated the ability of denatured DNA to react with antidenatured DNA antibodies, but not its ability to react with SLE sera. S 1 nuclease-resistant cores were isolated from extensively digested denatured DNA. These cores had secondary structure, including some stable fold-back helical regions. The cores, from 20 to several hundred base pairs in size, competed with native DNA for binding by SLE sera. Other experiments measured reactions of denatured DNA under conditions that affected its secondary structure content. Its competitive activity decreased as temperature was increased from 0 ° to 37 °C, whereas the activity of native DNA was not altered in this temperature range. With DNA pieces of 90 - 110 base pairs, native fragments were much more effective than the denatured fragments, in which stable helical structure is less likely to occur than in high molecular weight denatured DNA. Competitive assays with mononucleotides, oligonucleotides, homopolymers, and RNA-DNA hybrids also indicated that two strands of polydeoxyribonucleotide were required for optimal reactions with these SLE serum antibodies. The antibodies can measure stable helical regions in denatured DNA; they may also stabilize short helical regions that occur in an equilibrium of conformational forms...|$|E
40|$|Sera from {{patients}} with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} and from mice spontaneously developing lupus were subjected to isoelectric focusing by a microsucrose gradient method. The spectrotypes of human antibodies to native DNA, denatured DNA, and polyriboadenylic acid (poly A) were compared. Antibodies to native DNA and denatured DNA focused into two regions whose boundaries were pH 5. 0 - 7. 0 and pH 8. 5 - 10. 0. <b>Antinative</b> <b>DNA</b> antibodies were more homogeneous than antidenatured DNA antibodies. Anti-DNA antibodies in cryoglobulins showed more restriction than those present in serum. There was no relationship between spectrotype and pattern of disease expression. Murine antibodies to native DNA were more heterogeneous than human anti-DNA antibodies. The spectrotypes of antidenatured DNA antibodies {{from patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus or drug induced lupus, or from an immunized rabbit, were similar. Likewise, antibodies to poly A were similar in both human and murine lupus. In contrast to anti-DNA, antibodies to poly A were restricted and focused only in the alkaline range (pH 9. 5 - 10. 0). The spectrotype of antipoly A antibodies induced by lipopolysaccharide were comparable but had an additional small band at pH 6. 2. Our results suggest unique antibody spectrotypes {{with varying degrees of}} restriction for different nucleic acid antigens. Furthermore, spontaneous and induced autoantibodies have similar spectrotypes. Thus, the B cell clones producing antinucleic acid antibodies may be similar whether they are activated spontaneously, following immunization, or as a consequence of polyclonal stimulation...|$|E
