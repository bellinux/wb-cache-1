5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

We discovered a class of Extremely Functional Ionic Liquids made by an efficient green synthesis starting from trialkylamines or trialkylphosphines and dimethylcarbonate. The synthesis of these liquids will be described. The resulting methyltrialkylonium ionic liquids can be easily and irreversibly <b>anion</b> <b>exchanged</b> thereby allowing to tune properties such as melting point, solubility, acid–base properties, stability, and viscosity, yielding a plethora of different ionic liquids with only CO 2 and methanol as by-products.

(b) The members of this class of ionic liquids which bear a CH 3 OCO 2 - or HOCO 2 - anion are unexpectedly basic {{and can be used}} as organocatalysts for base-promoted C-C bond forming reactions, such as Micheal, Henry, Baylis-Hillman, and others. Comparison with traditional basic organocatalysts such as phosphazenes, DABCO, DBU, DMAP indicate that these new materials are more active, although the reasons are not yet fully understood. (c) Nitrate <b>anion</b> <b>exchanged</b> ionic liquids can be used, for example, as catalysts for electrophilic aromatic oxychlorination. (d) Due to the fact that CO 2 is liberated in the presence of an acid, they can in principle be used as new foaming agents...|$|R
30|$|As pH is {{less than}} pHZPC (Table  1), the net charge on surface of the solid {{activated}} carbon adsorbents is positive due to adsorption of excess H+, which favors adsorption due to columbic attraction. So, {{it is expected that}} acidic conditions favor the fluoride adsorption on {{to the surface of the}} solid activated carbon adsorbent. But according to fluoride speciation, neutral hydrofluoride which has less affinity towards active carbon adsorbents is predominant in the pH at less than 3 (Lagergren 1898), and so, less adsorption is observed at low pH conditions. At low pH values, the fluoride ion converts into neutral HF, and thereby <b>anion</b> <b>exchanging</b> nature is lost.|$|R

25|$|An {{increase}} in counter ion (with {{respect to the}} functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an {{increase in}} pH reduces the retention time in <b>anion</b> <b>exchange.</b> By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation exchange column, for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations.|$|E
25|$|Most of the charged {{impurities}} {{are usually}} anions such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Either cation exchange chromatography is used {{at a low}} enough pH that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their isoelectric point (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as the}} pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, albumin has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.|$|E
40|$|Strong {{effects of}} ion {{association}} on the anion-exchange selectivity in systems water -solutions of high quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) in organic solvents {{as well as}} on the potentiometric selectivity of plasticized polyvinylchloride (PVC) membranes containing QAS as ion exchangers have been established experimen¬tally and substantiated theoretically. Based on the linear Gibbs energy relations (LGER) and ion association theory by Eigen-Denison-Ramsey-Fuoss, an approach to separate estimation of the parts played by the solvation and ion association fac¬tors in ion-exchange and potentiometric selectivity has been proposed. The results obtained serve as the basis for revision of the formed notions about QAS as of «nonselective» ion exchangers and enable the development of methods for the con¬trol of ion-exchange and potentiometric selectivity using the factor of ion associa¬tion. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that variation of steric accessibility of the QAS exchange center is a powerful means to control the selectivity. It has been found experimentally that due to varying steric accessibility of the QAS exchange center the selectivity values have changed by 3 orders of magnitu¬de in case of single- charged <b>anions</b> <b>exchanged</b> for single-charged ones and by more than 7 orders - in case of double-charged <b>anions</b> <b>exchanged</b> for the sing¬le-charged ones. The above-mentioned effects revealed also in the potentiometric selectivity of QAS-based PVC membranes and to some extent - in the potentiometric selectivity of the membranes based on neutral anion carriers, doped with QAS for provision of anion permselectivity, are of great practical importance for the development of ISE with improved selectivity...|$|R
30|$|The ion {{exchange}} method is basically {{based on the}} capability to exchange cations with metals in the wastewater (Maranon et al. 1999; Kononova et al. 2000; Monteagudo and Ortiz 2000; Pagano et al. 2000). There are different types of materials used, which may be natural (alumina, carbon, silicates) or synthetic (zeolites and resins). Among them, zeolites are most abundantly used in the {{ion exchange}} process (Fernandez et al. 2005). The ion exchange process takes place by both cations and <b>anions</b> <b>exchange</b> in aqueous medium by ion exchange.

30|$|The present work {{aimed to}} develop a new SPAR for {{selective}} pre-concentration of 1 -naphthol traces from water samples. SPAR changes its color, with no additional reagent added, as the pollutant’s concentration increases up to its maximum allowed concentration (MAC).

The SPAR, which is introduced in this work, is based on m-aminophenylarsonic acid (m-APAA), immobilized on silica with grafted quaternary ammonium <b>anion</b> <b>exchanging</b> groups. The azo coupling between 1 -naphthol and the DS, formed by diazotation of immobilized m-APAA, ensures high efficiency of the pollutant pre-concentration and selectivity of SPE; intense color of azo product means low detection limit.|$|R

25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{kinetics}} {{of human}} {{red blood cell}} Cl transport have been studied under nonequilibrium conditions {{to determine whether or}} not an outward Cl gradient can recruit the transport protein from an inward-facing to an outward-facing configuration. Three kinds of evidence are consistent with 170 mM. Second, an outward Cl gradient strongly enhances the inhibitory potency of DNDS (4, 4,'-dinitro- 2, 2 '-stilbene disulfonate), which suggests that DNDS binds primarily to outward-facing states.
