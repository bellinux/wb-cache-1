5|$|The NTSB {{report on}} the {{accident}} noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended {{to those who were}} conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the <b>accident</b> <b>site,</b> all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the <b>accident</b> <b>site</b> to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the <b>accident</b> <b>site</b> at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway {{carrying}} a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} reduce otter () road {{mortality}} and to predict <b>accident</b> <b>sites,</b> we assessed the localities of traffic accidents involving otters in the Uckermark County, Brandenburg, Northeast Germany. Eighty-eight otter <b>accident</b> <b>sites</b> from the years 1990 to 2003 [...] as recorded by the (Brandenburg State Office for Environment) [...] were categorised according to traffic and road patterns, otter habitat suitability, as well as presence and type of watercourse crossings. From these numerical data, we {{compiled a list of}} characteristics to identify other potentially dangerous sites where otter road traffic accidents are likely to occur using a geographic information system. With a principal component analysis, we categorised three groups of <b>accident</b> <b>sites.</b> Firstly, most otter road accidents were located close to either one or two lakes. Secondly, otters were frequently killed at places where no body of water occurred within a distance of 200  m to the road. Thirdly, and in contrast to other locations, in the Uckermark County, fewest accidents happened where a road crossed a watercourse. Mitigation measures were suggested and discussed for the recorded and potential <b>accident</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{accident}} occurred around 3:00a.m. on November 17, 1981 {{during the}} construction of the Manila Film Center. Its scaffolding collapsed, and at least 169 workers fell and were buried under quick-drying wet cement. A blanket of security was immediately imposed by the Marcos administration, and neither rescuers nor ambulances were permitted on the site until an official statement had been prepared. The rescuers were eventually permitted to go inside the <b>accident</b> <b>site</b> 9 hours after the collapse.|$|E
25|$|A de Havilland Sea Vixen {{was already}} {{airborne}} ready {{to perform the}} next display after the Hunter; instead it flew overhead at altitude and departed to the north. With an Avro Vulcan due {{half an hour later}} at 14:05, it was decided to let it perform a tribute flypast, after which the show was closed. All the aircraft at the airport were already grounded {{due to the lack of}} fire cover and the creation of an exclusion zone around the <b>accident</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the <b>accident</b> <b>site.</b> The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the check rail {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off check rail then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|E
40|$|South Tyrol is {{a popular}} {{destination}} in Northern Italy for tourists {{from the north and}} south of the Alpine mountain ranges. The growing demand for tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and climbing has led to a large number of accidents in the region over the years. This has resulted in an increased demand for rescue helicopters, as most of the <b>accident</b> <b>sites</b> are not accessible by vehicles on-ground. In this project we focus on optimising the locations of three rescue helicopters coordinated by a South Tyrolean rescue organisation called Weißes Kreuz in order improve the emergency response times. Two models were formulated to solve this problem. The first model minimises the average response times and the second minimises the worst response times. We solve the two models using some effective heuristics. These heuristics do not guarantee optimality but do provide local optimal solutions that can improve the response times considerably. The methods implemented have shown that the model that minimises the worst response time results in more evenly distributed <b>accident</b> <b>sites</b> to the new helicopter base locations...|$|R

25|$|Drowning {{is a major}} {{worldwide}} {{cause of}} death and injury in children. Long term neurological outcomes of drowning cannot be predicted accurately {{during the early stages}} of treatment and although survival after long submersion times, mostly by young children, has been reported, many survivors will remain severely and permanently neurologically compromised after much shorter submersion times. Factors affecting probability of long term recovery with mild deficits or full function in young children include the duration of submersion, whether advanced life support was needed at the <b>accident</b> <b>site,</b> the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room.|$|E
25|$|A {{commission}} {{was appointed to}} investigate the accident. Representatives from the Royal Norwegian Air Force and de Havilland inspected the wreckage on 11 November, concluding that the aircraft was a write-off. That day {{there was a large}} stream of people who came {{to have a look at}} the <b>accident</b> <b>site.</b> By then all personal properties had been removed. Parts from the plane were afterwards used to rebuild another two Herons: LN-NPI, after it was damaged on 26 January 1957, and LN-SUL. The commission published a preliminary investigation report on 20 November and the final report was published on 9 May 1957 and had the same conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Because of its low boiling point, spent HF is {{regenerated}} by fractionation {{within the}} HF alkylation unit. However, fresh HF {{must still be}} brought into the refinery to replace the HF consumed. The unloading and handling of fresh HF must be undertaken with great care since this operation carries the same risk to the refinery workers and surrounding community from an HF release as previously discussed. Perhaps the greatest transportation risk related to HF is the potential release during an accident while transporting fresh acid from the manufacturer to the refinery. Since no mitigation equipment would be available at an <b>accident</b> <b>site,</b> the consequences could be catastrophic.|$|E
50|$|Heliports {{are common}} {{features}} at hospitals where they serve to facilitate Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and MEDEVACs for transferring patients {{into and out}} of hospital facilities.
