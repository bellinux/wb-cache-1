5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from the Yorkshire team, Leyland returned {{to play for}} Harrogate until 1950, when he became chief coach, along with Arthur Mitchell, at Yorkshire. Mitchell was a dour, serious man but the contrast with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland {{also served as a}} representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of Yorkshire until illness forced {{his retirement}} in 1963. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he maintained some connections with Yorkshire cricket and <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour. Leyland died in a hospital at Knaresborough on 1 January 1967.|$|E
5|$|I've <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> {{to insert}} {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire {{other people who}} go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to find a flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because {{of the death of}} his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Cadbury always {{emphasized}} that the Canton Christian College was entirely a Chinese institution just receiving aid from foreigners. To better the hospital, he aimed to bring Western medicine and modern hospital guidelines and to maintain a healthy relationship between the Western and Chinese doctors. He didn't want to impose the Western way of thought or control on the school or hospital unilaterally. When {{he returned to the}} USA for furloughs, he <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to learn more, buy new equipment and instruments, and buy new medical journals. He also urged doctors to work at Canton Hospital and become missionaries.|$|E

25|$|Michael Harner, in his 1997 article The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice, {{estimates}} {{the number of}} persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year. Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl, a Mexica descendant {{and the author of}} Codex Ixtlilxochitl, claimed that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. Victor Davis Hanson argues that an estimate by Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is more plausible. Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to intimidate their enemies, it is far more likely that they inflated the official number as a propaganda tool.|$|E
25|$|Nikolai, {{initially}} {{delighted to}} have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical and make his own beliefs feel dated. Nikolai has <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolai's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house {{to live with him}} and has already had a son by her. Arkady however is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.|$|E
25|$|Annie {{said she}} should have left the house after her daughter, Sophie, was born (in 2004, Sophie Anquetil {{published}} the book Pour l'amour de Jacques in which she confirmed what had been rumoured but what Anquetil had <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to hide: that she was Anquetil's daughter). Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded that she leave instead. When Janine refused, Annie left instead. To fill {{the gap in the}} house, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous. Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, Les Elfes, where she organises conferences. Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in Calenzana, near Calvi. Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.|$|E

25|$|The Antioch Review, {{founded in}} 1941, {{is one of}} the oldest {{continuously}} publishing literary magazines in America. They publish fiction, essays, and poetry from both emerging as well as established authors. Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and the American experience have had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine’s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a belles-lettres or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both Malcolm Bradbury and Eric Bentley, sans footnotes. The Antioch Review has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes. The Review has <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to be a forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} scene, Patterson is {{pressed against the}} bars of his cell, {{screaming}} and pleading that he is innocent, while the camera focuses on a gargoyle drawn in blood {{on the wall of}} his cell. Earlier in the episode, Mulder told Scully that he and Patterson disagreed on the best way to investigate serial murders, and Patterson <b>always</b> <b>tried</b> to empathize with the suspect, imagining himself in the killer's place. [...] Mulder's closing narration concludes that it was this that eventually drove Patterson insane.|$|E

[...] Doyle, the guitarist, stated that Hot Chip change the original recordings when playing their music live. At the London-based studio called the Strongroom, [...] "One Pure Thought", [...] "Hold On" [...] and [...] "Shake a Fist" [...] were recorded live, instead of on multitrack, and were subsequently pieced together. This was the first occasion that Hot Chip had recorded music in a studio environment.|$|E

[...] Robert agreed that the new title was a testament to the [...] "new chapter" [...] in the band's career. Weiland also felt the band was starting over and thought the music expressed this on its own. [...] "We don't need {{to come up with some}} major conceptual title.
