5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured.

One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E

5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E

The conservatives privately rallied behind the queen's nephew and adoptive son Ramboasalama, whom the queen had initially declared heir apparent some years prior, and who had never abandoned hope to one day reclaim the right that had briefly been accorded to him.|$|E

Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E

5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E

5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches <b>and</b> <b>acute</b> sensitivity to light.

On 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's right hemisphere.|$|E
