50|$|The gene encodes {{a protein}} of 383 residues, {{including}} a typical signal peptide of 12 amino acids. The plasma protein {{is a single}} chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kiloDaltons. ApoL1 has a membrane pore forming domain functionally {{similar to that of}} bacterial colicins. This domain is flanked by the membrane <b>addressing</b> <b>domain</b> and both these domains are required for parasite killing.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the killing {{mechanism}} is the binding of TLF to high affinity receptors—the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptors—that are located in the flagellar pocket of the parasite. The bound TLF is endocytosed via coated vesicles and then trafficked to the parasite lysosomes. ApoL1 is the main lethal factor in the TLFs and kills trypanosomes after insertion into endosomal / lysosomal membranes. After ingestion by the parasite, the TLF-1 particle is trafficked to the lysosome wherein Apo1 is activated by a pH mediated conformational change. After fusion with the lysosome the pH drops from ~7 to ~5. This induces a conformational change in the ApoL1 membrane <b>addressing</b> <b>domain</b> which in turn causes a salt bridge linked hinge to open. This releases ApoL1 from the HDL particle to insert in the lysosomal membrane. The ApoL1 protein then creates anionic pores in the membrane which leads to depolarization of the membrane, a continuous influx of chloride and subsequent osmotic swelling of the lysosome. This influx in its turn leads to rupture of the lysosome and the subsequent death of the parasite.|$|E
40|$|Deltorphins are {{naturally}} occurring peptides with high affinity and selectivity for δ-opioid receptors. They share with dermorphin, another μ-selective opioid agonist, the same N-terminal tripeptide Tyr-D-Xaa-Phe, where D-Xaa is a D-Ala or a D-Met residue. This common sequence {{appears to be}} essential for the best fitting of the peptides to both μ- or δ-opioid sites. We studied the changes in receptor affinity and selectivity and in biological potency of deltorphins due to shortening of the sequence, C-terminal deamidation or single amino acid substitutions. The results {{support the view that}} a code addressing the molecule towards δ-opioid sites is expressed in the C-terminal region of these peptides. This <b>addressing</b> <b>domain</b> confers high δ-selectivity to the ligand in the following two ways: (i) increased affinity for δ-sites; (ii) decreased affinity for μ-sites. The sequence of the C-terminal tripeptide appears to be responsible for the high δ-affinity of the molecules. Negatively charged side chains inhibit μ-binding and enhance δ-selectivity...|$|E

Domain adaptation is the important problem of adapting a supervised classifier trained on a given image (source domain) to the classification of another similar (but not identical) image (target domain) acquired on a different area, or on the same area at a different time. The main idea of the proposed approach is to iteratively labeling and adding to the training set the minimum number of the most informative samples from target domain, while removing the source-domain samples that does not fit with the distributions of the classes in the target domain. In this way, the classification system exploits already available information, i. e., the labeled samples of source domain, {{in order to minimize}} the number of target domain samples to be labeled, thus reducing the cost associated to the definition of the training set for the classification of the target domain. Experimental results obtained in the classification of a hyperspectral image confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique...|$|E

Johnson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 203 pages, appendix p. 190 - 203. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) rehabilitation interventions are very heterogeneous due to injury characteristics and pathology, patient demographics, healthcare settings, caregiver variability, and individualized, multi-discipline treatment plans. Consequently, comparing and generalizing {{the effectiveness of}} interventions is limited largely due to non-interoperable domain data. <b>Addressing</b> <b>domain</b> data interoperability through standardization can help unpack the "black-box" of rehabilitation treatment research. This paper describes {{the development of a}} foundational non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical ontology for TBI rehabilitation to facilitate domain interoperability. A conceptualization of the clinical domain was developed through a triangulation of data sources in order to create context and to serve as the underlying source for an ontology. A set of classes with primitive ontological relations based on the conceptualization was assembled in the Protégé Ontology Editor. The ontology is designed to facilitate further granularity of classes, properties, and instances as a collaborative hub for domain engagement. It is proposed that the ontology will aid in identification of effective rehabilitation components through the facilitation of comparative effectiveness research (CER) ...|$|E
40|$|Model based {{testing is}} an {{approach}} for automatic generation of test cases {{on the basis}} of a representative model of the system. Recent studies show that model based testing has many possible advantages over manual test generation techniques including a gain in effectiveness, efficiency and reuse. The effectiveness (ability to uncover faults in a system) of a model based testing process is determined by the correctness of the model and by the number of requirements represented in the model. In practice, test models for model based test automation techniques are usually created from requirement or design specifications of the software and hence, these techniques overtly rely on such specifications for the completeness of the test models. This may lead to failure in testing some critical requirements specific to the application domain because the user, who helps in defining the requirements, may fail to consider certain domain specific requirements. To him some may appear to be too trivial to be specified explicitly in the requirements document and the others, he may forget. Even if the requirement is complete with domain specific requirements, testers may not realize criticality of such requirements or may find them too complex to model. In all such cases, testing is incomplete and ineffective. This dissertation describes a new model based testing technique developed to remedy such situations. The new technique is based on modeling the system under test using a strongly typed domain specific language (DSL). In the new technique, information about domain specific requirements of an application are captured automatically by exploiting properties of the DSL and are subsequently introduced in the test model. The new technique is applied to generate test cases for the applications interfacing with relational databases and the example DSL chosen for that purpose is HaskellDB. Test suites generated using the new technique are enriched with test cases <b>addressing</b> <b>domain</b> specific implicit requirements and therefore, are more effective in finding faults. This dissertation will present details of the technique and describe an experiment and a case study to explore its effectiveness, efficiency, usability and industrial applicability...|$|E

40|$|Semantic {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to facilitate interoperability in different fields of study. Current literature, however, shows that the semantic approach has not been used to facilitate the interoperability of <b>addresses</b> across <b>domains.</b> <b>Addresses</b> are important reference data used to identify locations and /or delivery points. Interoperability of address data across <b>address</b> or application <b>domains</b> is important because it facilitates the sharing of address data, addressing software and tools which can be used across domains. The aim of this research study has been to evaluate how a semantic (ontologies) approach could be used to facilitate address data interoperability and what the challenges and benefits of the semantic approach are. To realize the hypothesis and answer the research problems, a multi-tier hierarchy of ontology architecture was designed to integrate (across <b>domain)</b> <b>address</b> data with different levels of granularities. Four-tier hierarchy of ontologies was argued to be the optimal architecture for address data interoperability. At the top of the hierarchy was Foundation-Tier that includes vocabularies for location-related information and semantic language rules and concepts. The second tier has address reference ontology (called Base Address Ontology) that was developed to facilitate interoperability across the <b>address</b> <b>domains.</b> Developing optimal <b>address</b> reference ontology was one of the major goals of the research. Different domain ontologies were developed at the third tier of the hierarchy. Domain ontologies extend the vocabulary of the BAO (address reference ontology) with domain specific concepts. At the bottom of the hierarchy are application ontologies that are designed for specific purpose within an <b>address</b> <b>domain</b> or domains. Multiple scenarios of address data usage were considered to answer the research questions from different perspectives. Two interoperable address systems were developed to demonstrate the proof of concepts for the semantic approach. These interoperable environments were created using the UKdata+UPUdata ontology and UKpostal ontology, which illustrate different use cases of ontologies that facilitate interoperability. Ontology reason, inference, and SPARQL query tools were used to share, exchange, and process address data across <b>address</b> <b>domains.</b> Ontology inferences were done to exchange address data attributes between the UK administrative address data and UK postal service address data systems in the UKdata+UPUdata ontology. SPARQL queries were, furthermore, run to extract and process information from different perspective of an <b>address</b> <b>domain</b> and from combined perspectives of two (UK administrative and UK postal) <b>address</b> <b>domains.</b> The second interoperable system (UKpostal ontology) illustrated the use of ontology inference tools to share address data between two address data systems that provide different perspectives of a domain.

40|$|Nociceptin is a heptadecapeptide whose {{sequence}} {{is similar to}} that of Dynorphin A, sharing a message domain characterized by two glycines and two aromatic residues, and a highly basic C-terminal <b>address</b> <b>domain</b> but, in spite of these similarities, displays no opioid activity. Establishing the relative importance of the message and <b>address</b> <b>domains</b> of nociceptin has so far been hampered by its extreme conformational flexibility. Here we show that mutants of this peptide, designed to increase the helical content in the <b>address</b> <b>domain,</b> can be employed to explain the mode of interaction with the NOP receptor. Nociceptin analogues in which Ala residues are substituted with aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) show a substantial increment of activity in their interaction with the NOP receptor. The increment of biological activity was attributed to the well-documented ability of Aib to induce helicity. Here we have verified this working hypothesis by a conformational investigation extended to new analogues in which the role of Aib is taken up by Leu. The NMR conformational analysis confirms that all Ala/Aib peptides as well as [Leu(7, 11) ]-N/OFQ-amide and [Leu(11, 15) ]-N/OFQ-amide mutants (N/OFQ=nociceptin/orphanin FQ) have comparable helix content in helix-promoting media. We show that the helical <b>address</b> <b>domain</b> of nociceptin can place key basic residues at an optimal distance from complementary acidic groups of the EL(2) loop of the receptor. Our structural data are used to rationalize pharmacological data which show that although [Leu(11, 15) ]-N/OFQ-amide has an activity comparable to those of Ala/Aib peptides, [Leu(7, 11) ]-N/OFQ-amide is less active than N/OFQ-amide. We hypothesize that bulky residues cannot be hosted in or near the hinge region (Thr(5) -Gly(6) -Ala(7)) without severe steric clash with the receptor. This hypothesis is also consistent with previous data on this hinge region obtained by systematic substitution of Thr, Gly, and Ala with Pro...|$|R
