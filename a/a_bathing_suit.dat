25|$|As a child, Allen {{had been}} scalded badly on one arm, {{and she was}} {{extremely}} sensitive about the scarring. Throughout her life, she wore either full or three-quarter length sleeves to hide the scars. The half-forearm style became as much a Gracie Allen trademark as her many aprons and her illogical logic. When the couple moved to Beverly Hills and acquired a swimming pool, Gracie put on <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and swam {{the length of the}} pool to prove to her children that she could swim. (She fought a longtime fear of drowning by privately taking swimming lessons.) She never put on <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> or entered the pool again.|$|E
25|$|Others welcome {{everyone}} whether dressed or nude (subject {{to other}} miscellaneous rules and requirements). Some people have issues with body shame—especially the areas commonly covered by <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> {{while in a}} mixed-gender nudist setting. A married couple might have one spouse who is comfortable being fully nude, but the other spouse is not. If a full nudity policy were in place, such a family would have to split up for the day, or find an alternative activity. A few resorts attempt a compromise by allowing females to wear minimal clothing, but not males.|$|E

500|$|Girl with Ball {{depicts a}} woman wearing <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> holding a beach ball with red stripes in {{the same color as}} her lips and tongue. Lichtenstein used a painter's version of comic strip artist {{techniques}} to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using Ben-Day dots of primary colors. The process is described as exaggerating the [...] "limitations of mechanical reproduction" [...] to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking. Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using [...] "commercial shorthand".|$|E
500|$|The {{cover for}} Off the Deep End parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant {{in the deep}} end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line. The Off the Deep End cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, the {{character}} of Nancy Drew was used in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, which lasted until 1997. The Nancy of the Files series is also interested in romance and boys, a fact which led to much criticism of the series: [...] "Millie [...] purists tend to look askance upon the Files series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi." [...] Cover art for Files titles, such as Hit and Run Holiday (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or breasts, or <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often chloroformed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against chokeholds. The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships.|$|E

500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 8, 1910. It states: [...] "Leon is a waiter in a cheap table d'hote restaurant and makes desperate love to the fat French cashier, Rosa. Off on his vacation, Leon decides to pose as a foreign nobleman. At a seaside hotel where he stops, he becomes all the rage. One of the guests at the same hotel is a beautiful young heiress, a Violet Hope, whose designing mother at once conceives the idea of marrying her off to the supposed count. The plan does not meet with Violet's approval, she is already {{in love with a}} native born. One day while bathing in the surf, Violet, who is an expert swimmer, comes to the assistance of the bogus count, who has been knocked over by a breaker, and delivers him safely {{into the hands of the}} lifeguard. The count at once lays his life and fortune at Violet's feet, greatly to that young lady's disgust and her mother's delight. In the meantime Rosa becomes acquainted with the doings of her absent lover and traces him to the beach. Finding him in the water, and beyond her reach, Rosa also dons <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and after a chase through the waves, captures Leon and forces him to confess that he has been sailing under false colors. He was led back to the restaurant by the triumphant Rosa, while Violet obtains her mother's consent to wed the man of her choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Bathing Beauty, {{previously}} titled Mr. Coed, starred Red Skelton {{as a man}} who enrolls in a women's {{college to}} win back his swimming instructor fiancee, played by Williams. This was her first Technicolor musical. The studio changed the title of the film to showcase Williams. Almost all of the film's posters featured Williams in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> though the swimming sequences make up {{a small portion of the}} film. Her date to the premiere at the Astor Theater in New York City was future husband Ben Gage. For the event, MGM publicity set up a six story-tall billboard of Williams diving into Times Square with a large sign that said [...] "Come on in! The story's fine!" ...|$|E
2500|$|As she matured, people {{commented on}} Tate's beauty; she began {{entering}} beauty pageants, winning {{the title of}} [...] "Miss Richland" [...] in Washington in 1959.

[...] With the family relocating in Verona, Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> {{on the cover of the}} military newspaper Stars and Stripes. She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and for the first time in her life began to form lasting friendships.|$|E
2500|$|... "Maurice", {{owned by}} Chris Getman, {{was perhaps the}} most {{noteworthy}} of the Handsome Dans. He served in office longer than any other Handsome Dan; he was the only holder of the office to come out of retirement to serve again, due to the death of his successor; and he appeared in Sports Illustrated, in 1989. His patience with the tedium of posing for professional photographers also served him well as he posed for game programs, brochures, and the 1991 Yale Christmas card, wearing a wreath and Santa Claus hat. He also appeared at swim meets, wearing <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> His love of Yale was evident in many ways: he would sing along with the Yale fight song (at least the [...] "bow wow wow" [...] part); he would [...] "play dead" [...] when asked whether he would rather die or join Harvard; and he lost his normally docile nature around mascots of opposing teams, launching assaults on the Princeton tiger mascot and the Brown University bear mascot. (There was also an unfortunate incident involving a policeman on horseback which resulted in his being ejected from the Harvard-Yale game, and Halloweens were somewhat touchy.) He died in 1997, just before turning 14.|$|E

2500|$|Friday the 13th was Nelson's {{first feature}} film, {{and when he}} went in for his first {{audition}} {{the only thing he}} was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, [...] "It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it." [...] Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the [...] "practical joker victim" [...] of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served {{as a model for the}} slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} of the song kicked off Rouvas' {{successful}} collaboration with photographer and director Yorgos Lanthimos, who {{would go on to}} create the majority of Rouvas' most acclaimed videos over the next two years. Lanthimos won in 2008, the [...] "Off-Cannes" [...] Palme for one of his movies and was nominated for an Oscar in 2010. Similar to some of Rouvas' past videos, the video features sexual content, especially for the time of its release that earned it some criticism, while also making it very popular. It contains four scenes, all on one setting, which is an outdoor patio. The video starts by showing quick flashes of various objects, namely a toy gun, a polaroid camera and photographs, a statue, and beach toys. Throughout the video, flashes of Rouvas singing into the camera can be seen while half-naked, playing around in a small outdoor pool. In another recurring scene, Rouvas' is lying down while shirtless while water continuously spalshes over his torso, while the camera angle is right above him, making it appear as he is being trapped by a glass effect. In {{the second half of the}} video, Rouvas can be seen dancing on the patio wearing an open purple T-shirt. The other scenes feature Rouvas playing around with two young women who have very similar features, although one is blonde and the other is brunette. In one scene, they are dressed in bikinis, feather boas, stilettos and diamond jewelry and are drinking champagne, while in the other they are dressed more casually. Rouvas blindfolds the two women and sends them off to search for him while he is watching. During the bridge of the song, Rouvas places the brunette woman in front of the target and aims to take a shooting stand, finally shooting her with the plastic gun on the right side of her chest. He then picks up a golf club and shoots the ball, while afterward, he is brought to lie down while the same woman stands over him, taking numerous polaroid photographs while he poses both clothed and in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> The video plays with the effects of using fast flashes and off-angle shots in combination with some slow-motion and rewinding shots, such as Rouvas slightly getting out and going fully back into the pool, which is replayed many times.|$|E
