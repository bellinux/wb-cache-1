For Mexico: the number of false negatives FN = 9; number of true positives TP = 3; number of false positives FP= 1; number of true negatives TN= 58. Hence B 1 = 0.859, P 0 = 0.983, P 1 = 0.25 <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>S</b> 0 =B 1 +P 1 +P 0 = 2.09.

To highlight this keyword dependence, we assign a color to the bar chart associated with the score contributions as follows: P 1 (gray), B 1 (cyan) and P 0 (yellow). Combining these gives the S 0 value shown. The pair yielding the highest S 0, i.e. overall success, is (2, 3) corresponding to the pair of words huelga and manifestacion which are used to obtain the results in the left panel and hence 2.09, other combination yield to smaller score values. For Venezuela in Figure  4, the on-street events {{have a very different}} pattern from the case of Mexico, which suggests that a prediction model developed for one country based on transferring directly the pattern of activity in another, is likely to be highly inaccurate. The measures of success in Figure  4 for Venezuela, which is our worst performing case, are: number of false negatives FN= 9; number of true positives TP= 27; number of false positives FP= 18; number of true negatives TN= 17.

The popularly known and well studied class of loops called Bol loops fall into this class <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>S</b> 2 ndBLs generalize Bol loops. The Smarandache isotopy of S 2 ndBLs is introduced and studied for the first time. It is shown that every Smarandache isotope (S − isotope) of a special loop is Smarandache isomorphic (S − isomorphic) to a S-principal isotope of the special loop. It is established that every special loop that is S-isotopic to a S 2 ndBL is itself a S 2 ndBL. A special loop is called a Smarandache G-special loop (SGS − loop) if and only if every special loop that is S-isotopic to it is S-isomorphic to it. A S 2 ndBL is shown to be a SGS-loop if and only if each element of its special subloop is a S 1 st companion for a S 1 st pseudo-automorphism of the S 2 ndBL.

40|$|We {{consider}} the adjoint action of a connected complex semisimple group G on its Lie algebra g. A sheet of g is a maximal irreducible subset of g consisting of G-orbits of a fixed dimension. The Lie algebra g is the finite union of its (not necessarily disjoint) sheets. It is known how sheets are classified, {{and how they}} intersect (see [2] for the whole story). Let S be a sheet of g. A fundamental result says that S contains a unique nilpotent orbit. Let e, h, f be a standard triple in g such that e is contained in S. Let gf be the centralizer of f in g and define X � gf by e +X = S (e + gf). Katsylo then constructs in [9] a geometric quotient : S ! (e+X) /A where A denotes the centralizer of the triple in G. On the other hand, Borho and Kraft {{consider the}} categorical quotient � S : S ! S//G and the normalization map of S//G. They construct a homeomorphism from the normalization of S//G to the orbit space S/G, which is equipped with the quotient topology. Suppose S were smooth (or normal). The restriction of �S to S then factors through the normalization of S//G and the induced map is a geometric quotient by a standard criterion of geometric invariant theory ([15], Proposition 0. 2). We note that the induced map may be a geometric quotient without S being smooth (or normal). The purpose of this work, however, is to investigate the smoothness of sheets. The main result is: Theorem. The sheets of classical Lie algebras are smooth. If g is sln, this {{is a result of}} Kraft and Luna ([13]), and of Peterson ([17]) (see also [1] for a detailed proof). For the other classical Lie algebras a few partial results were obtained by Broer ([4]) and Panyushev ([16]). They both heavily use some additional symmetry. On the other hand, one of the sheets of G 2 is not normal (see [19]), the remaining ones being smooth. For most of the sheets of exceptional Lie algebras it is not known whether they are smooth or not. This work is organized as follows: In the first chapter, we recall the notions of decomposition class and of induced orbit, as well as their relevance to the theory of sheets. Let l be a Levi subalgebra of g and x 2 l a nilpotent element. The G-conjugates of elements y = z + x such that the centralizer of z is equal to l form a decomposition class of g (“similar Jordan decomposition”). The fact that every sheet contains a dense decomposition class leads to the classification of sheets by G-conjugacy classes of pairs (l,Ol) consisting of a Levi subalgebra of g and a so called rigid orbit Ol in the derived algebra of l. A rigid orbit is a (nilpotent) orbit which itself is a sheet. The unique nilpotent orbit in the sheet corresponding to a pair (l,Ol) as above is obtained by inducing Ol from l to g: Let p be any parabolic subalgebra of g with Levi part l, and pu its unipotent radical. The induced orbit Indg l Ol is then defined as the unique orbit of maximal dimension in G(Ol + pu). In the second chapter, we explain Katsylo’s results on sheets in detail. Let S be the sheet corresponding to a pair (l,Ol) and let e, h, f be a standard triple in g such that e is contained in S. If the triple is suitably chosen the sheet S may be described as G(e + k) where k denotes the center of l. We use the canonical isomorphism attached to the triple (2. 1), and obtain a morphism ": e + k ! e + gf such that e + z and "(e + z) are G-conjugate for every z 2 k. It turns out that "(e + k) is an irreducible component of e + X, the intersection of S and e + gf. Moreover, the centralizer of the triple in G acts transitively on the set of irreducible components of e + X, and its connected component acts trivially on e + X. Essentially by sl 2 theory, the two varieties S and e + X are smoothly equivalent. This is the approach we use to investigate smoothness of sheets. At the end of the chapter, we apply these ideas to the regular sheet of g and to admissible sheets of g. The regular sheet is the (very well known) open, dense subset consisting of the regular elements of g. It corresponds to the pair (h, 0) where h is a Cartan subalgebra of g. By Kostant, e + gf is contained in the regular sheet and every regular element is G-conjugate to a unique element of e + gf. Hence " maps e + h onto e + gf; it is the quotient by the Weyl group of G. The admissible sheets, in this context, are those coming nearest to the regular sheet. In the remaining chapters, we deal with sheets in classical Lie algebras (in fact, our setting is slightly more general (3. 1)). We prove that " maps e+k onto e+X; {{it turns out to be}} the quotient by some reflection group acting on k. Therefore e+X is isomorphic to affine space <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>S</b> is smooth. We first take a look at the linear group, that is, G is equal to GL(V) for some complex vector space V. In this case, the sheets of g are in one-to-one correspondence to the partitions of dim V (3. 3). In order to make this explicit, we associate a partition to every y 2 g as follows: We decompose V as a C[y]-module into a direct sum of cyclic submodules by successively cutting off cyclic submodules of maximal dimension. The dimensions of these direct summands define a partition of dim V. The sheets of g are then the sets S(l) consisting of elements y 2 g with fixed partition l. The crucial observation is the fact that there is a decomposition of V into direct summands Vi which respects the setting of the second chapter in the following sense (Chapter 5) : Let S be a sheet of g described as G(e + k) and let ": e + k ! e + gf be the corresponding map. For every y 2 e + k, the C[y]-module V decomposes into a direct sum of the same cyclic submodules Vi. We find elements ei and subspaces ki of gi = gl(Vi) such that Gi(ei +ki) is the regular sheet of gi, and such that e = P i ei and k � �iki. Let "i : ei + ki ! ei + gfi i be the corresponding maps. Then " is the restriction of P i "i to k. But we already know that "i is the quotient by the Weyl group of Gi. Finally, a straightforward calculation using basic invariants (power sums) shows that " is the quotient by the normalizer of k in the Weyl group of G, which in this case acts as reflection group on k. Since the centralizer of the triple e, h, f in G is connected, the image of " is equal to e + X. The proof for the symplectic groups Sp(V) and for the orthogonal groups O(V) follows along the same lines. We begin with a classification of sheets in combinatorial terms (3. 4). Then we use the combinatorial data to decompose V into a direct sum of subspaces Vi such that a proceeding similar to the linear case is possible (6. 1). To be more precise, V decomposes as C[y]-module into the direct sum of submodules Vi for every y 2 e + k. These submodules may not be cyclic; however, they decompose into at most two cyclic submodules. The next step consists of identifying the maps "i : ei + ki ! ei + gfi i as quotients by some reflection group acting on ki. The case of Vi decomposing into two cyclic submodules of different dimension is the core of this work (6. 3). It requires a lot of ad hoc calculation. The two other cases are readily reduced to the case of the regular sheet (6. 2). At last, a calculation using basic invariants shows that " is the quotient by some reflection group acting on k (6. 4). Acknowledgments.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies suggest}} that early {{modifications}} in metabolic pathways and behaviour, leading to energy conservation and reduced linear growth, could represent adaptations to nutritional constraints during foetal life and infancy.

This study aims at assessing whether: (1) dual-burden preschool children (simultaneously stunted and overweight) of Yaounde (Cameroon) have low birth-weight (indicator of foetal undernutrition) and reductions in fat oxidation, resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity, (2) fat oxidation, REE and physical activity are associated with foetal growth.
