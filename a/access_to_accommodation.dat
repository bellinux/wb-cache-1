40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of discourses of authenticity on the development and application of statutory definitions of Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales since 1959, and the subsequent consequences for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation</b> for these communities. These definitions are concerned with land use, equalities, housing, and homelessness legislation. The basis of these definitions is found in statute and policy and decision makers ranging from local authorities through to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) are responsible for their development and application. Each of these definitions has different consequences with regard to <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The research examines a chronological analytical narrative of the development and application of these definitions over a 53 year period, which consists of an examination of relevant case law, policy, law and other useful sources. Interviews with key informants involved {{in the development and}} application of statutory definitions serve to reinforce the interpretation of the evidence. The evidence is assessed using the notions of discourses of authenticity, which are constructed as the discourse regarding the authenticity of an individual or group as Gypsies or Travellers as prescribed by other individuals, groups or institutions and the implications of this ascription. There has not been a comprehensive analysis {{of the relationship between the}} discourse around the authenticity of Gypsies and Travellers and statutory definitions in modern times.

40|$|Migrant social {{networks}} have become {{somewhat of a}} trademark of global migration. Social networks and their development cannot only {{be recognized as a}} by product of migration, instead what has been noted is that {{social networks}} have emerged as primary actors in the migration process as seen in the incidence of the Asian migrant population in Lenasia. The use of social networks by migrants allow for migrants to accrue a range of benefits such as <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation,</b> employment, security and participation in social activities. With regard to the research report, the use of social networks by Asian migrants to access accommodation in Lenasia {{has been the focus of}} the study. Initial assumptions about this transient community entailed that migrants in Lenasia were generally unable to access accommodation through other formalised mechanisms such as rental companies therefore they relied on social networks. This has however been proven incorrect and what was found was that the migrant population had in fact never considered or utilised the services of a rental company because their social networks had always successfully met their accommodation needs. The occurrence of migrant social networks in Lenasia has initiated further migration into the area, and subsequently led to the development of migrant enclaves operating in isolation from the pre-existing community. The effect the creation of migrant enclaves in Lenasia has had on the area’s development trajectory is explored in the research. In addition the consequences of migrant enclaves and separate social networks between the pre-existing and migrant community are investigate...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of poverty and social {{exclusion}} on the food, diet and nutrition of people out-of-home in Dublin. The research involved a food frequency survey carried out with 75 people out of home, qualitative interviews with 12 individuals {{as well as a}} self-completion questionnaire administered to 18 food service providers in Dublin city. One of the main findings from the study was that the extent and experience of food poverty among homeless people was not only conditioned by income inadequacy and other socio-economic and cultural determinants, but particularly, by <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation,</b> as well as the quality of that accommodation. The report makes a number of practice and policy recommendations to tackle food poverty and homelessness. The qualitative approaches to food poverty employed for use with this sample of people out-of-home aimed to deal in depth with issues around food consumption. Through drawing a sub-sample from those who participated in the survey research (a process of recapture), the authors sought to expand on the survey questionnaire information on food issues. The themes for the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) emerged from the analysis of the survey questionnaires and 4 key thematic areas were selected. i) Access to cooking, preparation and storage facilities ii) Access, choice and constraints in food purchase and consumption iii) Access to information about healthy diet, food preparation and storage iv) Expectations, cultures, values and choice concerning eating The qualitative aspect of the research enquiry eventually generated one FGD and seven semi-structured interviews representing the views of a total of 12 persons all of whom had completed the initial survey questionnaire.

40|$|This Bachelor {{assignment}} {{details the}} housing situation {{for people with}} substance abuse and / or mental disorders in Norway. The exercise {{is based on a}} literature study, the aim of which is to examine how the Housing First model could be a solution to enhance the work with people with substance abuse and / or mental disorders in Norway. The main findings from the Norwegian context is that successful housing of such individuals plays a key role for good health and participation in social settings. Furthermore, it’s interesting to distinguish between structural and individual explanations why such individuals do not benefit from permanent housing, as the structural explanation refers to the huge shortage of suitable accommodation, however general stigma in society towards such groups is an influential factor that acts as a barrier to accessing housing on the private market. Evaluation of the Housing First model does demonstrate positive results, such as the fact that the majority of individuals do obtain permanent housing and as such this acts as a cost saving for the State. The good results are derived partly due to the way the model stimulates the participants to have freedom of choice and focuses on a spread settlement, whereas the model must additionally be based on closer collaboration with the private housing market. It is essential in the Housing First model that the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation</b> should not be earned, as is presently the case in the existing support system. Housing is a human right, and as such the focus is that successful housing must be in place before people are in any position to receive treatment. The model appears to have great potential in the Norwegian context and may contribute to the reduction of certain issues in the current housing and support services in Norway...|$|E
40|$|The Immigration Act 2014 ’s {{measures}} respecting foreign {{criminals and}} those unlawfully present on UK territory represent a fundamental {{attack on the}} rule of law. The Act declares that the deportation of foreign criminals 'is' in the public interest, presaging revocations of leave and new refusals for those previously granted leave after their criminal convictions. Such would arguably amount to the imposition of retrospective criminal penalties in breach of art 7 ECHR and/or denial of a fair trial in breach of art 6 ECHR. Section 17 removes appeal rights against deportation for foreigners convicted (or suspected) of criminal conduct until they have left the UK, unless they would face ‘a real risk of serious irreversible harm’. However, many migrants, lawfully or unlawfully present, cannot obtain national documents and are therefore unable to leave the UK. Unless removal is ‘simply impossible’ (the 'Hale threshold’, {{as set out in}} Khadir) such people will remain indefinitely on temporary admission. To be unable to leave the country to exercise a right of appeal accessible only from outside the UK amounts to a denial of an effective remedy under art 13 ECHR. Similarly, to be unable to leave the UK but have no <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation,</b> support, work, benefits or healthcare unless meeting legally-demanding tests must be challengeable. The exclusion of immigration law from the scope of Arts 6 and 7, confirmed by Maaouia and barely challenged since, rested on an acceptance that immigration control is a purely administrative matter, amenable only to public law challenge: and on there being other remedies for 94 bthose facing expulsion. Both the changing legal character of immigration control, and the diminishing access to other remedies, demand a detailed review of that judgment...|$|E
40|$|The {{high level}} of {{migration}} of people from Northern to Southern Ghana is rooted in historical antecedents. The general objective {{of this study is}} to explore the gendered strategies of migrants from Northern to Southern Ghana through social networks for the purpose of gaining access to the informal economy. The specific objectives are to examine (a) gender differences in the reasons for migration from Northern Ghana to the study area in Madina (a suburb of Accra); (b) gender differences in types of, and support from, social networks; and, (c) examine the differences in the economic opportunities and constraints that migrants encounter in the study area of Madina. The conceptual framework I used in this thesis have been derived from theories of gender (Cope 2002; Moore 1988), ethnicity (Barth 1969; Cohen 1969, 2004), and social networks (Granovetter 1983, 1995). From a gender theoretical view, women and men are affected by migration differently. So, with the feminist epistemology the reasons of migration and social network used are looked at. The concept of ethnicity was used to analyze how diverse ethnic groups from the Northern Region support migration process and also help migrant's adapt to their new environment. The concepts of strong ties' and weak ties' within the social networks theory is used to identify and analyse the extent to which migrants made use of the strong ties (kinship relations) or weak ties (which includes friendship and ethnic groups). A sample size of 58 migrants, comprising 37 females and 21 males, were interviewed. The emerging findings from the study include the following. There are gender differences in (i) access to social networks; (ii) occupations available to migrants and, (iii) opportunities and constraints opened to women and men. With regards to social networks, the social ties women used were kinship relations (such as parents, cousins, siblings) in migrating. However, when they arrived in the study area, many of them moved out from these kinship ties to join friendship ties and ethnic group membership. In contrast, the men migrate normally with friends and seek the help of their ethnic groups in Madina to have access to economic opportunities. When it comes to the role of ethnicity in migration, both women and men relied on ethnic ties in getting <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodation</b> and jobs in the study area. These and other empirical findings are discussed in the thesis...|$|E
