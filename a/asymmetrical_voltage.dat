It is shown that some methods known from the literature do not work well, particularly in cases of <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>voltage</b> sags. Furthermore, some methods require measurements of instantaneous values, which is not always feasible. Therefore, symmetrical component transformation is applied, whereas only positive-sequence components are used.

30|$|<b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>voltage</b> swells during {{recovery}} of a short-circuit fault lead to {{fluctuations in the}} dc-link voltage of a renewable energy conversion system (RECS), and may induce reversed power flow and even trip the RECS. This paper studies characteristics of both typical causes resulting in the practical <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>voltage</b> swell and the voltage {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) during the fault recovery. As analyzed, the fault recovery process can be divided into two continuous periods in which different control strategies have to be applied. Also protective measures are necessary in the transient period of the process. Additionally, the asymmetrical high-voltage ride-through capability and the controllability criteria of the RECS are analyzed based on eliminating the fluctuations. Furthermore, an asymmetrical control scheme is proposed to maintain the controllability of the RECS and ride through the entire recovery process. As verified by the simulation, the scheme can promise the RECS to deal with the practical fault recovery period and mitigate the dc-link voltage fluctuations, which improves the reliability of the RECS and the power system.|$|E

A large number of topologies have been developed in this area such as voltage and current source inverter. Recent developments in switching schemes and control methods have made the voltage-source resonant inverters widely used in several applications that require output power control.

30|$|By {{studying}} {{the characteristics of}} the typical causes resulting in <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>voltage</b> swells, the PCC voltage during the fault recovery have limited voltage unbalance, phase angle jump and discrete transients. Furthermore, the fault recovery process can be divided into two periods, and different control strategies should be applied in the periods. The asymmetrical HVRT capability of the RECS is analyzed quantitatively by considering the elimination of the dc-link voltage fluctuations. As analyzed in the paper, the RECS cannot always ride through the continuous period during the practical fault recovery without increasing the dc-link voltage, even when the input active power is zero. Additionally, the RECS should not restore the active power output in a too large rate. The results can be used as the guideline of new HVRT grid codes. Based on the analysis, an asymmetrical HVRT control strategy with a chopper circuit is proposed for the RECS to ride through the entire fault recovery process and mitigate the fluctuations. Simulation verified the effectiveness of the strategy.|$|E

Using asymmetric voltages, glucose oxidase layers with a thickness of 7 mu m could be deposited on a platinum electrode in 20 min time as verified with a microbalance, carbon analysis and scanning electron microscopy. In contrast, if a symmetrical alternating signal is used {{under the same}} conditions, a layer of 0. 5 mu m is formed. We believe the deposition is due to two effects: the electrophoretic migration of the enzyme towards the deposition electrode and the pH induced precipitation of the enzyme near the deposition electrode. The electrophoretic migration {{is due to the}} non-linear dependence of the electrophoretic mobility on the electric field caused by the asymmetry of the applied alternating current signal. In addition, pH changes near the deposition electrode drive the enzyme towards its point of zero charge (PZC), perhaps causing the precipitation of GOx on the substrate. The effect of amplitude, frequency, deposition time and GOx concentration on the deposition rate was studied. An amplitude of 160 Vp-p and a frequency of 30 Hz was found to be optimal for the formation of thick enzyme layers, which excludes {{a big part of the}} interferences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Four {{different}} control {{strategies for}} {{the control of the}} inverter currents of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system are analysed and evaluated by means of simulation using Matlab/Simulink. Special attention is paid to the behaviour of the generator during <b>asymmetrical</b> grid <b>voltage</b> dips. Different control schemes are employed to reduce torque and DC-link voltage oscillations and the resulting additional loads on the system during such dips. The field-oriented control (FOC) scheme is the one usually deployed for the control of DFIGs in wind power plants and is used as the reference system within this study. The inverter currents are regulated by proportional-integral controllers (PI) in a rotating coordinate system in which they are represented by dq-components. These components are direct quantities. A positive-negative-sequence current control (PNC) strategy is used to control the positive-sequence currents and the negative-sequence currents separately in two contra-rotating coordinate systems using PI-controllers. In contrast to the first two control strategies, frequency-selective current controllers (FSC) serve to regulate the currents in a static coordinate system. In this case the currents are represented by two components which are alternating quantities. Combining the FSC and PNC strategies will produce frequency-selective positive-negative-sequence current controllers (FSC(PN)). These control the currents in a static coordinate system. The currents are represented by alternating components as in frequency-selective control but separate reference values for the negative-sequence currents are provided as in positive-negative-sequence control. Theoretical reasoning suggests and simulations prove that the three proposed alternative control strategies can improve the behaviour of DFIG-systems during slight asymmetries in the grid voltage. During severe dips the effect is limited by several constraints, namely by the inverter rating (limited inverter voltages and currents), by time delays introduced by the component calculation for PNC and FSC(PN) and by the nonlinear behaviour of the DFIG-system (saturation of mutual inductance). Nevertheless, the proposed novel control strategies could be applied beneficially to other systems, such as photovoltaic inverters or full-scale inverters for wind power plants...|$|R
