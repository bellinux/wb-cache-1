5|$|Originally the {{competition}} was open to {{children between the ages}} of 8 and 15, however in 2007 the <b>age</b> <b>range</b> was narrowed so that only children aged 10 to 15 on the day of the contest were allowed to enter. In 2016 the <b>age</b> <b>range</b> was changed again. From now on children aged 9 to 14 on the day of the contest are allowed to enter.|$|E

A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding {{when they were}} 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding.

30|$|Eighty {{participants}} {{took part}} in the experiment. All participants had normal vision and were studying experimental psychology at the University of Bristol, UK and completed the experiment for course credit. There were four groups of 20 participants. In the first group, The Good Unshuffled group, there were seven male participants whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> from 18 to 27 years (M[*]=[*] 22 [*]years). In the second group, The Good Shuffled group, there were five male participants whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> from 18 to 27 years (M[*]=[*] 23 [*]years). In the third group, the About Time Unshuffled group, there were eight male participants whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> from 18 to 32 years (M[*]=[*] 24 [*]years). And in the fourth group, the About Time Shuffled group, there were five male participants whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> from 18 to 23 years (M[*]=[*] 20 [*]years).|$|R
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an <b>age</b> <b>range</b> estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 <b>age</b> <b>range</b> than was usual for their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for The New Republic. He pontificated on transgender experience, and characterized the story as a unique form of drama or tragedy. In his introduction, he commented on the general absence of reviews for the show in major news publications.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{incidence}} is in {{the first}} year of life, and some cases are congenital. The <b>age</b> <b>range</b> is broad, including older children and adults, but only 10% of cases occur in people older than 5 years of age. A large European study reported less than 2% of over 4000 neuroblastoma cases were over 18 years old.|$|E
50|$|In the college's first {{academic}} year (2008-2009), it accommodated the original <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> {{that the two}} middle schools had before. The next year, the school increased their range to include year 9. Years 5 and 6 {{were removed from the}} school's range in the following two years. Each year, higher <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> were progressively accommodated at the school. By the {{academic year}} 2013-2014, the school had reached its goal to become a secondary school and sixth form. It was unique in the United Kingdom in accommodating these <b>age</b> <b>ranges,</b> a reflection of its changing status from middle to secondary school.|$|R

The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an <b>age</b> <b>range</b> from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron {{around the base}} of the volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E

5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her <b>age</b> <b>range.</b> Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited <b>age</b> <b>range</b> {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus, {{the type}} species, is known from 5 to 10 {{articulated}} skulls with some associated skeletal remains, from juvenile to adult individuals {{found in the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation. H. stebingeri is known from an unknown but substantial number of individuals, with an <b>age</b> <b>range</b> of embryos to adults. The hypothesis that H. altispinus and H. stebingeri form a natural group excluding other known hadrosaur species may be incorrect, as noted in Suzuki et al.s 2004 redescription of Nipponosaurus; their phylogenetic analysis found that Nipposaurus was {{more closely related to}} H. altispinus than H. stebingeri was to H. altispinus. This was rejected by Evans and Reisz (2007), though.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero. A follow-up investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time {{the number of}} children in the same <b>age</b> <b>range</b> identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.|$|E
5|$|None of {{them were}} {{particularly}} young. Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 30 and Weaver at 29 were in the <b>age</b> <b>range</b> of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or sidekicks, but by skewing older, Alien achieves a certain texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20million tons of ore to Earth.|$|E
5|$|South Street Community Primary School at the {{northern}} end of Deckham in Cramer Street and caters for pupils in the 3–11 <b>age</b> <b>range.</b> The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery provision was praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills below that expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall. The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved. In all inspection categories, the primary provision was judged good.|$|E

40|$|YesRecent {{advances}} in the methods of skeletal age estimation have rekindled interest in their applicability to paleodemography. The current study contributes to the discussion by applying several long established as well as recently developed or refined aging methods to a subsample of 121 adult skeletons from the early medieval cemetery of Lauchheim. The skeletal remains were analyzed by 13 independent observers {{using a variety of}} aging techniques (complex method and other multimethod approaches, Transition Analysis, cranial suture closure, auricular surface method, osteon density method, tooth root translucency measurement, and tooth cementum annulation counting). The <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> and mean <b>age</b> estimations were compared and results indicate that all methods showed smaller <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> for the younger individuals, but broader <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> for the older age groups...|$|R
5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that <b>age</b> <b>range.</b> The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E
