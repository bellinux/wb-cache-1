[...] Slit-Robo interactions are highly implicated, however, in the dendritic development of cortical neurons in that exposure to Slit1 leads to increased dendritic outgrowth and branching while inhibition of Slit-robo interactions attenuates dendritic branching.|$|E

Auditory fear conditioning {{is believed to}} be formed in the lateral amygdala (LA), by way of plasticity at auditory input synapses on principal neurons. To evaluate the contribution of LA cellular ensembles in the formation of conditioned fear memories, we investigated the LA micro-circuitry by electrophysiological and anatomical approaches. Polysynaptic field potentials evoked in the LA by stimulation of auditory thalamus(MGm/PIN) or auditory cortical (TE 3) afferents were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, two potentials were identified following stimulation of either pathway. In vitro, these multiple potentials were revealed by adding 75 uM Picrotoxin or 30 uM Bicuculine, with the first potential peaking at 15 - 20 ms, followed by two additional potentials at 20 – 25 and 30 – 35 ms, respectively. These data show single stimulation events can result in multiple synchronized excitatory events within the lateral amygdala. In order to determine underlying mechanisms of auditory signal propagation, LA principal neuron <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> trajectory patterns and morphology were analyzed. Neurons were found to have local axon collaterals that are topographically organized. Each <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> within the LA totaled 14. 1 ± 2. 73 mm, had 29. 8 ± 9. 1 branch points and 1870. 8 ± 1035 boutons (n= 9).

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches {{is a fundamental}} aspect {{of the development of}} neuronal circuits. Emergence of axonal filopodia from the axon {{is the first step in}} the {{formation of}} <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches and pre-synaptic structures. Using embryonic sensory axons as a model system, we have determined that axonal filopodia are formed from transient accumulations of F-actin within the axon, termed actin patches. We found that the branch-inducing factor NGF induces the formation of axonal actin patches and filopodia. NGF signaling, through PI 3 K, promotes the formation of localized axonal microdomains of PIP 3 accumulation. The microdomains in turn drive formation of actin patches. Under basal conditions, only a subset of actin patches gives rise to filopodia, and many patches dissipate without forming a filopodium. Neither NGF nor direct activation of PI 3 K affects the probability that an actin patch will give rise to a filopodium. Thus, NGF increases formation of axonal filopodia through localized PI 3 K signaling that promotes the initiation of actin patch precursors to the formation of axonal filopodia. The promotion of actin patch formation by NGF may be mediated through a PI 3 K-TOR pathway driving intra-axonal protein synthesis. We propose the hypothesis that NGF signaling “turns up the volume” on the mechanism of filopodial formation by increasing axonal levels of the cytoskeletal proteins required for the orchestration of actin patch formation by PIP 3 microdomains...|$|E
40|$|Neurons in the {{developing}} CNS tend to send out long <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> to multiple target areas. For these neurons to attain specific connections, some of their <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> are subsequently pruned—a process called stereotyped axon pruning. One {{of the most striking}} examples of stereotyped pruning in the CNS is the pruning of corticospinal tract (CST) axons. The long CST collaterals from layer V neurons of the visual and motor cortices are differentially pruned during development. Here we demonstrate that select plexins and neuropilins, which serve as coreceptors for semaphorins, are expressed in visual cortical neurons at the time when CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> are stereotypically pruned. By analyzing mutant mice, we find that the pruning of visual, but not motor, CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> depends on plexin-A 3, plexin-A 4, and neuropilin- 2. Expression pattern study suggests that Sema 3 F is a candidate local cue for the pruning of visual CST axons. Using electron microscopic analysis, we also show that visual CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> form synaptic contacts in the spinal cord before pruning and that the unpruned collaterals in adult mutant mice are unmyelinated and maintain their synaptic contacts. Our results indicate that the stereotyped pruning of the visual and motor CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> is differentially regulated and that this specificity arises from the differential expression of plexin receptors in the cortex...|$|R

40|$|The {{sprouting}} of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches {{is important}} in the establishment and refinement of neuronal connections during both development and regeneration. Collateral branches are initiated by the appearance of localized filopodial activity along quiescent axonal shafts. We report here that sensory neuron axonal shafts rapidly sprout filopodia at sites of contact with nerve growth factor-coated polystyrene beads. Some sprouts can extend up to at least 60 �m through multiple bead contacts. Axonal filopodial sprouts often contained microtubules and exhibited a debundling of axonal microtubules at the site of bead–axon contact. Cytochalasin treatment abolished the filopodial sprouting, but not the accumulation of actin filaments at sites of bead–axon contact.

40|$|In {{cortical}} pyramidal neurons the presynaptic terminals controlling transmitter release {{are located}} along unmyelinated <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals,</b> {{far from the}} original action potential (AP) initiation site, the axon initial segment (AIS). Once initiated, APs will need to reliably propagate over long distances and regions of geometrical inhomogeneity like branch points (BPs) to rapidly depolarize the presynaptic terminals and confer temporally precise synaptic transmission. While axon pathologies such as demyelinating diseases are well established to impede the fidelity of AP propagation along internodes, to which extent myelin loss affects propagation along BPs and <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> is not well understood. Here, using the cuprizone demyelination model, we performed optical voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging from control and demyelinated layer 5 pyramidal neuron axons. In the main axon, we find that myelin loss switches the modality of AP propagation from rapid saltation towards a slow continuous wave. The duration of single AP waveforms at BPs or nodes was, however, only slightly briefer. In contrast, by using two-photon microscopy-guided loose-seal patch recordings from <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> we revealed a presynaptic AP broadening in combination with a reduced velocity and frequency-dependent failure. Finally, internodal myelin loss was also associated with de novo sprouting of <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> starting from the primary (demyelinated) axon. Thus, the loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths bears functional consequences beyond the main axon, impeding the temporal fidelity of presynaptic APs and affecting the functional and structural organization of synaptic connectivity within the neocortex...|$|R

All labeled GP neurons had similar firing properties and gave rise to local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals,</b> the main synaptic targets of which were perikarya and primary dendrites. The neurons could be divided into two populations; neurons located within approximately 100 microm of the striatopallidal border ("outer" neurons), which possess a mean of 264 local axonal boutons, and those located approximately 100 microm or more from the striatopallidal border ("inner" neurons), which possess a mean of 581 local axonal boutons. The local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> gave rise to arborizations close to, or within, the parent dendritic field and arborizations located caudal, medial, and ventral to the parent neuron. The qualitative and quantitative differences in the connectivity of neurons located in the outer and inner regions of the GP underlie a complex microcircuitry that follows an asymmetric rostral to caudal organization. These data suggest that the GP should no longer be considered as an homogeneous relay nucleus that simply transmits striatal information to the subthalamic nucleus and basal ganglia output nuclei, but rather as a structure that can perform complex computations within its borders...|$|R

Genetic and biochemical data support a model in which direct binding of Slit to Dscam 1 enhances the interaction of Dscam 1 with RPTP 69 D, stimulating Dscam 1 dephosphorylation. Single-growth-cone imaging reveals that Slit/RPTP 69 D are not required for general branch initiation but instead promote the extension of specific axon collaterals. Hence, although regulation of intrinsic Dscam 1 -Dscam 1 isoform interactions is essential for formation of all mechanosensory-axon branches, the local ligand-induced alterations of Dscam 1 phosphorylation in distinct growth-cone compartments enable the spatial specificity of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> formation. status: publishe...|$|E

We have used Aplysia motor neurons to examine the role of CRE-binding proteins in axonal regeneration after injury. We report that axonal injury increases the binding of proteins to a CRE sequence-containing probe.

We have previously shown that the normal development of this circuitry involves the emergence of crude clusters from an unclustered pattern during the second postnatal week. Crude clusters are later refined to the adult level of specificity by the selective rearrangement of axonal arbors that initially project to incorrect orientation columns. Here we report that depriving animals of patterned visual experience by binocular lid suture prior to natural eye opening had no discernible effect on the emergence of crude clusters. In contrast, cluster refinement was dramatically affected by binocular deprivation. Injections of retrograde tracers in the striate cortex of animals binocularly deprived for greater than 1 month revealed only crude clusters, indicating that horizontal <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> projecting to incorrect orientation columns were retained well past the age when they normally would have been eliminated. Layer 2 / 3 pyramidal cells from 6 -week-old binocularly deprived animals had abnormal distributions of intrinsic horizontal <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> that mirrored the lack of cluster refinement. The radial clustering of their horizontal collaterals was considerably less precise than normal. These cells, nevertheless, developed many {{of the features of}} normal mature arbors, including the distal axonal branches not seen in arbors from younger animals with normal visual experience. Together, these results indicate that axonal rearrangements occurred, but with reduced specificity. Thus, binocular deprivation did not simply arrest the development of this orientation-specific circuit at an immature state but limited the accuracy with which <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> were added or eliminated. We suggest that development of this orientation-specific circuitry, like ocular dominance column segregation, may depend on temporal correlation of activity for regulation of axonal rearrangement. The specificity of rearrangement may be degraded in binocularly deprived cats because they do not experience sharply oriented visual stimuli necessary for concurrent activation of same-orientation columns...|$|R

The other source of GABAergic inputs to spiny neurons derives {{from a small}} number of interneurons, of which the best characterized are the parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons. Spiny neuron collateral inhibition was not demonstrated until recently, because the IPSPs recorded at the soma are surprisingly small. In contrast, interneuronal inhibition was readily detected, comprising much larger IPSPs. Here, we report the application of quantal analysis and compartmental modeling to compare and contrast IPSCs in spiny neurons originating from <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> and interneurons. The results indicate that individual release sites at spiny and interneuron synapses have similar quantal sizes and baseline release probabilities. Interneuronal unitary IPSCs are several times larger because of their proximal location on the neuron and because they have a larger number of transmitter release sites. Despite the small amount of current they can deliver to the soma, spiny cell collateral synapses had moderately high baseline release probabilities (0. 5 – 0. 9), suggesting that they are not weak because of some form of depression or modulation. The size of unitary collateral synaptic currents increased monotonically during development. These results argue against models of competitive inhibition in neostriatum, including those in which competitive inhibition is transiently effective during development and learning, and suggest a different role for the spiny cell <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals.</b> Key words: IPSC; basal ganglia; interneuron; quantal analysis; development; GABA; inhibitio...|$|R

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase r (RPTPr), a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, is widely expressed by neurons {{in developing and}} mature mammalian brain, and functions as a receptor for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that inhibits axon regeneration following injury. In this study, we address RPTPr function in the mature brain. We demonstrate increased <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branching in the hippocampus of RPTPr null mice during normal aging or following chemically induced seizure, indicating that RPTPr maintains neural circuitry by inhibiting axonal branching. Previous studies demonstrated a role for pre-synaptic RPTPr promoting synaptic differentiation during development; however, subcellular fractionation revealed enrichment of RPTPr in post-synaptic densities. We report that neurons lacking RPTPr have an increased density of pre-synaptic varicosities in vitro and increased dendritic spine density and length in vivo. RPTPr knockouts exhibit an increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents, and greater paired-pulse facilitation, consistent with increased synapse density but reduced synaptic efficiency. Furthermore, RPTPr nulls exhibit reduced long-term potentiation and enhanced novel object recognition memory.

Previously, it was shown that the unipolar brush cell axon branches within the granular layer, giving rise to large terminals. Single mossy fiber stimuli evoke a prolonged burst of firing in unipolar brush cells, which would be distributed to postsynaptic targets within the granular layer. Knowledge of the ultrastructure of the unipolar brush cell terminals and of the cellular identity of its postsynaptic targets is required to understand how unipolar brush cells contribute to information processing in the cerebellar circuit. To investigate the unipolar brush cell axon and its targets, unipolar brush cells were patch-clamped in fresh parasagittal slices from rat cerebellar vermis with electrodes filled with Lucifer Yellow and Biocytin, and examined by confocal fluorescence and electron microscopy. Biocytin was localized with diaminobenzidine chromogen or gold-conjugated, silver-intensified avidin. Light microscopic examination revealed a single thin axon emanating from the unipolar brush cell soma that gave rise to 2 – 3 <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> terminating in mossy fiber-like rosettes in the granular layer, typically within a few hundred mm of the soma.

Recordings from synaptically connected pairs of EGFP–TH interneurons and spiny neurons showed that the interneurons elicited GABAergic IPSPs/IPSCs in spiny neurons powerful enough to significantly delay evoked spiking. EGFP–TH interneurons responded to local or cortical stimulation with glutamatergic EPSPs. Local stimulation also elicited GABAA IPSPs, {{at least some of}} which arose from identified spiny neurons. Single-cell reverse transcription-PCR showed expression of VMAT 1 in EGFP–TH interneurons, consistent with previous suggestions that these interneurons may be dopaminergic as well as GABAergic. All four classes of interneuronsweremedium sizedwithmodestly branching, varicose dendrites, and dense, highly varicose <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> fields. These data show {{for the first time that}} there exists in the normal rodent striatum a substantial population of TH/GABAergic interneurons comprising four electrophysiologically distinct subtypes whose electrophysiological properties differ significantly from those of previ-ously described striatal GABAergic interneurons. These interneurons are likely to play an important role in striatal function through fast GABAergic synaptic transmission in addition to, and independent of, their potential role in compensation for dopamine loss in experi-mental or idiopathic Parkinson’s disease...|$|E

Neuregulin- 1 (Nrg 1) is a neurotrophic factor essential for the development and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions, and Nrg 1 receptor ErbB 4 loss-of-function mutations have been reported as causative for ALS. Our main goal {{was to investigate the}} role of Nrg 1 type I (Nrg 1 -I) in SOD 1 G 93 A mice muscles. We overexpressed Nrg 1 -I by means of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, and investigated its effect by means of neurophysiological techniques assessing neuromuscular function, as well as molecular approaches (RT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA) to determine the mechanisms underlying Nrg 1 -I action. AAV-Nrg 1 -I intramuscular administration promoted motor <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> sprouting by acting on terminal Schwann cells, preventing denervation of the injected muscles through Akt and ERK 1 / 2 pathways. We further used a model of muscle partial denervation by transecting the L 4 spinal nerve. AAV-Nrg 1 -I intramuscular injection enhanced muscle reinnervation by collateral sprouting, whereas administration of lapatinib (ErbB receptor inhibitor) completely blocked it. We demonstrated that Nrg 1 -I plays {{a crucial role in the}} collateral reinnervation process, opening a new window for developing novel ALS therapies for functional recovery rather than preservation...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} cortical columns are radially oriented <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> that form precise connections between distinct cortical layers. During development, these connections are highly specified {{from the initial}} outgrowth of collateral branches. Our previous work provided evidence for positional cues confined to individual layers that induce and/or prevent the formation of <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> in specific populations of cortical neurons. Here we demonstrated with in situ hybridization techniques that mRNA of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase EphA 5 {{and one of its}} ligands, ephrin-A 5, are present in distinct cortical layers, at a time when intrinsic connections are being formed in the cortex. Axonal guidance assays indicate that ephrin-A 5 is a repellent signal for a populations of axons that in vivo avoid the cortical layer expressing ephrin-A 5. In contrast to its established role as a repulsive axonal guidance signal, ephrin-A 5 specifically mediates sprouting of those cortical axons that target the ephrin-A 5 -expressing layer in vivo. These results identify a novel function of ephrin-A 5 on axonal arbor formation. The laminar distribution and the dual action on specific populations of axons suggest that ephrin-A 5 plays a role in the assembly of local cortical circuits...|$|R

The IFANs relaying mechanosensory information to sympathetic neurones of the prevertebral ganglion (PVG) function as volume detectors. It {{is possible that}} mechanosensory information arriving in the PVG via <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> of visceral spinal afferent nerves can be modulated entirely within the PVG itself.

40|$|Corticothalamic {{projection}} neurons in {{the cerebral}} cortex constitute {{an important component}} of the thalamocortical reciprocal circuit, an essential input/output organization for cortical information processing. However, the spatial organization of local excitatory connections to corticothalamic neurons is only partially understood. In the present study, we first developed an adenovirus vector expressing somatodendritic membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein. After injection of the adenovirus vector into the ventrobasal thalamic complex, a band of layer (L) 6 corticothalamic neurons in the rat barrel cortex were retrogradely labeled. In addition to their cell bodies, fine dendritic spines of corticothalamic neurons were well visualized without the labeling of their <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> or thalamocortical <b>axons.</b> In cortical slices containing retrogradely labeled L 6 corticothalamic neurons, we intracellularly stained single pyramidal/spiny neurons of L 2 - 6. We examined the spatial distribution of contact sites between the local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> of each pyramidal neuron and the dendrites of corticothalamic neurons. We found that corticothalamic neurons received strong and focused connections from L 4 neurons just above them, and that the most numerous nearby and distant sources of local excitatory connections to corticothalamic neurons were corticothalamic neurons themselves and L 6 putative corticocortical neurons, respectively. These results suggest that L 4 neurons may serve as an important source of local excitatory inputs in shaping the cortical modulation of thalamic activity...|$|R
