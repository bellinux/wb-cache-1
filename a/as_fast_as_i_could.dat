500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E
2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not know I had made a touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E
2500|$|George {{did some}} work {{on what would}} {{eventually}} become Down on the Farm but then [...] declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book Written in My Soul) conducted eleven days before his death, George {{made it clear that}} he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'. I just got out of there <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barr√®re.|$|E
