40|$|Abstract Undoubtedly, the 1980 Constitution {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by the painful experiences of Chile’s constitutional history in the financial field. Chile’s past political economy was characterized by a State that stifled private initiative, generated important <b>arbitrary</b> <b>discriminations,</b> intervened directly in economic activities {{through the creation of}} enterprises or indirectly through discriminatory laws, and so on. The new economic order restricts the State activity and seeks to prevent the implementation of an economic system based on State planning, such as the one that existed in Chile during the 70 ’s. The Constitution contains various provisions concerning the functioning of the State, which pertain to free enterprise freedom. It can be inferred from those provisions that the Constitution restricts State activity in order to prevent the implementation of an economic system based on State intervention or State planning. The existing constitutional rules are based upon the primacy of the individual and individual rights and freedoms, as the foundations for the constitutional system. These rules limit State power to a subsidiary role, according to which it may act only in cases when individuals or groups of people are unable or unwilling to act...|$|R

For {{each of the two}} delays, yield was slightly greater after forming arbitrary- instead of identity-relations. Yield was greatest, however, when a class contained a meaningful stimulus (PIC). During failed class formation, probes produced experimenter-defined relations, participant-defined relations, and unsystematic responding; delay, but not the relation type in preliminary training influenced relational and indeterminate responding.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} international trade and environmental protection, more particularly {{within the framework of the}} GATT dispute settlement system. In May 1993, the European Union took issue with the U. S. taxes on automobiles aimed primarily at environmental concerns.

The study of this dispute and the prospective analysis of its outcome show that both the gas guzzler tax and the luxury tax do not constitute a violation of the General Agreement. However, the CAFE payment violate the national treatment obligation and is not justified under the GATT general exceptions. The CAFE payment, despite that it is primarily aimed at fuel conservation, constitute a means of <b>arbitrary</b> and unjustifiable <b>discrimination.</b> The outcome of this dispute confirms the permissiveness and limits of the GATT rules toward legitimate environmental policies...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{differences}} in children’s conditional discrimination learning, equivalence-class formation, and equivalence-class disruption were investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, children between 2 and 9 {{years of age}} demonstrated age-related differences across a series of preliminary training steps, such that time to acquisition was more variable for younger than for older children on an initial identity matching and category matching task. However, {{upon completion of the}} preliminary training, there were no age-related {{differences in}} time to acquisition of the two <b>arbitrary</b> conditional <b>discriminations</b> that would {{serve as the basis for}} equivalence-class formation, nor were there differences in time to demonstrate stable equivalence classes (Experiment 2). Also in Experiment 2, children between 2 and 14 years of age were exposed to a potential challenge to the demonstrated equivalence classes; the reinforcement contingency for the AC conditional discrimination was reversed (i. e., given A 1, A 2 or A 3, reinforcers were produced by selecting C 2, C 3, or C 1 respectively). While there was little change in performance on reflexivity or BA symmetry tests following the challenge, age-related differences were obtained for CA symmetry and combined tests for equivalence. The older children were more likely to demonstrate an orderly change in equivalence-class membership consistent with the reversal training, while the younger children showed either little change or substantial disruption in their equivalence patterns. These data are considered in relation to more traditional investigations of children’s category formation, as well as their implications for the study of equivalence-class formation and flexibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{basal ganglia}} {{contribute}} {{to a variety of}} forms of learning. The first goal of this chapter is to review the different tasks (instrumental conditioning, visual <b>discrimination,</b> <b>arbitrary</b> visuomotor learning, rule learning, categorization, and decision making) that have been used to study basal-ganglia-dependent learn-ing in rodents, monkeys, and humans. These tasks have several features in common: in each, the subject is first presented with a stimulus within a behavioral context, is then required to respond with an appropriate behavior, and finally receives a reward or positive feedback for correct behavior. The second goal of this chapter is to examine how these different features (stimulus, response, and reward) involve the independent corticostriatal loops that connect the basal ganglia with cerebral cortex. The visual corticostriatal loop is involved in aspects of visual stimulus processing; the motor corticostriatal loop is involved in response selection; and the executive and motivation corticostriatal loops are involved in processing feedback and reward. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the corticostriatal loops interact during learning. ...|$|R

For some subjects, one cycle through all the phasesended the experiment (Experiment 1); for others, in a second cycle,verbal feedback was reversed to follow selections based on the otherrelation and all phases were repeated (Experiment 2); and for 1 subject, contextual stimuli indicated which relation would lead topositive verbal feedback for each selection (Experiment 3). On testphases, the selections of all subjects became increasingly consistentwith verbal feedback during training while the contextual stimulireliably enabled the appropriate relations.

40|$|The {{question}} that this paper addresses is whether age discrimination laws are justified {{for the protection}} of older workers from a societal and economic point of view. An analysis of the congressional intent in enacting the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and a brief review of significant court interpretations of the ADEA provides initial insight into the legislative objectives and the unique problems that older persons face in the workforce. Both the positive and negative impacts of the ADEA on older workers and cost efficiency objectives of employers are evaluated. Despite certain of its limitations in protecting older workers and increase in costs to employers, the enactment of the ADEA has been instrumental in initiating policies that address the changing demographic of an aging workforce and prompting a transformation in human resource practices towards older workers. LEGAL ANALYSIS The ADEA states as its objective in broad terms: to promote the employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit <b>arbitrary</b> age <b>discrimination</b> in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment. 1 Whether the ADEA is effective in meeting its objectives is unsettled. The longstanding problem with anti-age discrimination legislation, including the ADEA, is that the enforcement mechanisms typically bear little consequence to the violator. While pre-ADEA laws lacked any administrative procedures to uphold policies, the ADEA is enforced through the Equal Opportunities Employment Commission, as are Title VII violations. However, the damages to an employer for violating the ADEA are slight compared to other discrimination violations. Furthermore, injunctive 1 29 U. S. C. § 621, et seq. relief in which the older worker is rehired is not a desirable remedy for the typical worker who has resorted to filing a claim against their employer...|$|R
