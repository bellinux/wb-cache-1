5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> be drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E

30|$|Although {{many studies}} have been done, {{there are still some}} {{problems}} that need to solve. For example, most of SAPs are weakly cross-linked acrylic acid-based polymer and they are often used under salinity conditions, so much more <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> be focused on the improvement of their salt resistance. Moreover, SAPs are often used under pressure conditions, so the gel strength should also be considered.|$|R

30|$|Replication {{of the in}} vivo {{mechanical}} patterns or parameters is also a prior {{challenge to}} confine the understanding how mechanomics works for cells. In a living organism, the in vivo mechanical environment is quite complicated and usually coupled with other physical and chemical factors. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} replicate the local biomechanical environment that surrounds cells or comprises tissues and is hard to determine the physiological mechanical patterns or parameters. Meanwhile, existing in vitro data for cells exposed to mechanical stimuli are usually compared with those under static culture conditions, which require the careful design of control cases that are expected to subtract reasonably background noises from measured signals. More <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> also be paid for those stimuli not indicated here (e.g., vibration, sound, touch).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Some {{properties}} of paper sludge were analyzed, including water content, organic material content, pH value, fiber content, ash content,C,H,O,N,S and metal content in dried sludge. The {{results showed that}} water content was high, organic material content was high, pH value was in a neutral level, metal elements were varied. Besides, calorific value was detected in a thermal power plant. Disposal of residue wastes from pulp and paper mills is a paramount issue facing the world today. Paper sludge is the solid waste from papermaking industry. The sludge treatment and disposal process will bring about environmental pollution. Therefore,much <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> be paid to disposal of paper sludge. It is expected that this paper can provide deep insights into the disposal of paper sludge...|$|R
25|$|A {{combination}} of ACE inhibitor with other drugs may increase {{effects of these}} drugs, but also the risk of adverse effects. The commonly reported adverse effects of drug combination with ACE are acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The drugs interacting with ACE inhibitor should be prescribed with caution. Special <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> be given to combinations of ACE inhibitor with other RAAS blockers, diuretics (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), NSAIDs, anticoagulants, cyclosporine, DPP-4 inhibitors, and potassium supplements.|$|E
25|$|Health {{groups have}} become {{increasingly}} vocal in their call for agricultural policies to contribute towards resolving the consumption problems of food; such as, excessive intake of saturated fatty acids (FSA), sugar and salt, or under-consumption of vitamins and minerals. More <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> be paid, it is argued, on intervention policies upstream, at the primary food production and processing stages, to influence nutritional quality and the structural determinants of food choice, including; availability, accessibility and price.|$|E
25|$|The {{osmolality}} of {{the contrast}} agent was previously {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. <b>Attention</b> <b>should</b> be paid to using contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
40|$|Survey {{method is}} one of the {{research}} methods employed in management accounting and behavior research. However, this method has been heavily criticized especially regarding the quality to the data. This study examines the quality of survey research in management accounting and behavior. We use a framework that has been used by Van der Stede et al. (2005) to examine the quality of all mail surveys in management accounting and behavior published in proceeding of Simposium Nasional Akuntansi (SNA) over a period of year 1999 - 2012.

40|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of rhabdomyolysis are non-specific and not present in all cases, and mild cases might go unrecognized. We present a case of rhabdomyolysis recognized in a 68 -year-old man after elevation of liver enzymes following prolonged urologic surgery. The patient’s postoperative course was concerned with elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase without any clinical manifestations on the first postoperative day. After examining the serum creatine kinase and myoglobin levels, the patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. After 16 days, he was discharged with fully recovered liver enzymes and creatine kinase. We suggest that sufficient perioperative <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> be given to patients at a higher risk of rhabdomyolysis. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2011; 61 : 341 - 343...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} the effect of land-use pattern on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relations in Zichang Watershed of the Loess Plateau. From 1986 to 1997, many farmlands changed into grassland or woodland, especially the farmland in steep slope positions or far away from the river. The change of land-use pattern altered the rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships, and led to higher slope of trend curves(STCs) of annual rainfall-runoff mass curve and runoff-sediment mass curve in 1990 s than that in 1980 s. It is implied that more soil and water loss yielded in 1990 s. In order to reduce soil loss, more <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> be paid to land-use pattern and some grass or other herbaceous filter strips should be built along rivers...|$|R
25|$|The cost {{difference}} is more evident {{when compared with}} mutual funds that charge a front-end or back-end load as ETFs do not have loads at all. The redemption fee and short-term trading fees are examples of other fees associated with mutual funds that do not exist with ETFs. Traders should be cautious if they plan to trade inverse and leveraged ETFs for short periods of time. Close <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> be paid to transaction costs and daily performance rates as the potential combined compound loss can sometimes go unrecognized and offset potential gains {{over a longer period}} of time.|$|E
