5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills {{of rights and}} English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed {{in the way in}} which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E
5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> decision {{to wait for the}} arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E

At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.
