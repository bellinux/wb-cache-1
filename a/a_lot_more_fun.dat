[...] Varietys Joe Leydon gave a negative review, describing it as: [...] "A half-baked, time-wasting curtain-raiser for a superhero franchise that is never, ever going to happen." [...] Christy Lemire for RogerEbert.com gave half a star out of 4, writing: [...] "For a movie about developing the greatest energy source in the universe, Max Steel is surprisingly bland" [...] and that [...] "a movie based on a toy should be <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than this." [...] The Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck gave an unfavorable review, writing: [...] "Even tweens may find themselves underwhelmed by the new live-action film based on what — for many of them — may be their favorite Mattel action figure. Delivering a bland cinematic origin story which seems calculated to boost Christmas toy sales, Max Steel is a stillborn, would-be franchise starter, sneaked into multiplexes without advance critic screenings." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> in small doses.)" ...|$|E

The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun,</b> too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from James L. Brooks, who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as {{traveling}} to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy, who in turn cannot stand her family. Believing {{that it would be}} a tough episode to write, Brooks gave the job to Greg Daniels, who was enthusiastic about it and has said that it was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> easier and <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to write than expected. The plot involving Homer's cuff links was not in the original draft; it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh's disdain for the Simpson family. The end theme was redone by Alf Clausen as a [...] "Renaissance version", including a harp.|$|R
5000|$|LA Times editor Ann Powers {{wrote that}} [...] "Whyyouwannabringmedown" [...] gives Clarkson [...] "a chance to howl the way she's wanted to since her grunge-loving teen years." [...] Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Clarkson: even touches on her hard rock infatuation and {{improves}} it, {{particularly on the}} bubblegum punk [...] "Whyyawannabringmedown." [...] PopMatters praised: [...] "the punky “Whyyawannabringmedown” feels {{like one of the}} few songs where Clarkson is allowed to let her freak flag fly, and amidst the stop-start guitars that chug around her, Clarkson's rock-ready wail makes her sound like a dead ringer for Tia Carrere's character in Wayne's World." [...] Despite positive reviews Billboard editor Elle J Small called this song a giant mistake: [...] "when Clarkson delves in to punk/thrash territory on Whyyawannabringmedown- purists will despair and KC fans will be perplexed." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone praised her vocal delivery and described this song: [...] "a kind of AM-radio punk. [...] "I'm not your love monkey, so be takin' back all of the lies you sold," [...] cries Clarkson over a pogo-ing beat." [...] Slant Magazine's Jonathan Keefe wrote this song sounds like Pink reject: [...] "Her throat-shredding punk snarl on [...] "Whyyawannabringmedown" [...] is <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than it is convincing." [...] Claire Lobenfeld of Vibe wrote a mixed opinion: “Whyyouwannabringmedown” is the album's most confusing cut. The song's lyrics fit in with the rest of Clarkson's catalogue, but between her yelps and wails and the power chord progression, it comes off like a product of Fisher Price's My First Punk Rock Song." ...|$|R

He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally.

500|$|In {{the writing}} of {{previous}} albums by Rolo Tomassi {{a majority of the}} music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For Astraea, the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the [...] "main brains". In January 2012, in an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. The choice of returning to Sanderson was because he has been a close friend of the band members for a long time. Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be [...] "more direct and heavier", but also noted that the band [...] "will never shy away from being experimental". However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather just having a say in every aspect of the album progress. In April 2012, the NME did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was [...] "70% complete". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan [...] "breathed new life" [...] into the band's writing as the original three members had become [...] "too set in their ways". The band members have commented that this has made the writing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> as the band no longer writes a song then learns it. As the band wrote Astraea they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's singing.|$|E

[...] John Hanson of Sputnikmusic gave the album a score of 4.5 out of five and called it [...] "simply an immense album." [...] Uncut gave it a score of four stars out of five and called it the band's [...] "most digestible record yet." [...] Blender also gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, [...] "Never before have these kings of experimental metal sustained such pulse-quickening energy, honing their tricks--cryptic lyrics, cliffhanging cries, spine-twisting rhythms--into a screaming arrow of sound." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Most of the time, however, the band makes a righteous racket that straddles the worlds of prog rock, funk, fusion jazz and world music, with Eastern motifs spicing 'Aberinkula' {{and a bit of}} cosmic blues making its way into 'Conjugal Burns.'" [...] Vibe likewise gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "Rarely does rock music feel so simultaneously orchestrated and raw." [...] Shilpa Ganatra of Hot Press gave it a positive review and said, [...] "The manner in which the group weave complex musical tapestries is certainly impressive from a purely technical perspective, but you suspect that they were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to assemble than they are to listen to." ...|$|E
40|$|Politics and {{research}} in Luxembourg pay {{little attention to the}} local youth(sub) cultures despite their manifold activities and high visibility. In youth research und youth studies youth(sub) cultures were mainly perceived in connection with leisure activities and delinquent behaviour but have never been a topic of their own. The present dissertation expands the existing data and supplements youth research in Luxembourg by adding a further and important element. It allows a first empirical view on Luxembourgish youth(sub) cultures and their scenes. The study is based on a field research project following a qualitative heuristic design (Kleining, 1982) and focussing on three youth(sub) cultures: LAN-gaming, Techno and Parkour. All collected data was subject to a computer aided data analysis on commonalities for the different research topics. Two research questions emerging from the field study were of main interest. The primarily focus is on the structure of the youth(sub) cultures, the way they are conceived and constituted. Knowledge of the structure is regarded as an essential and important starting point to understand youth(sub) cultures. The structure's analysis is led by the 'scene concept' by Hitzler and Niederbacher (2010 b). It could be demonstrated, that the explored youth(sub) cultures can be considered as scenes in terms of the 'scene concept'. However, the analysis shows some further characteristics, e. g. requirements to join the scene, and the scene's way to deal with preconceptions. Scenes in Luxembourg seem to show tendencies to break with their informal structure and apparently approach more traditional and formal ways of association. Youth(sub) cultures seem to face some elementary changes and developments in the future. Identifying the framework of the three scenes allowed elaborating an appropriate and meaningful thematic depth. Already at an early stage of the field research it became apparent that few scene members invest considerable time and energy to create and establish the scene. By doing so they are practically also in charge of the scene's structure. According to the 'scene concept' these people could be described as organisational elite – the scene's motor. Using methods of the free field research concept (Girtler, 2001) the study asked for the motives lying behind this commitment by asking: What lies behind the fun? So the second research topic targeted first these members' commitment and could identify decision levels with assigned roles and fields of activity, e. g. the administrator, the organiser or the expert. The organisational elite's commitment shows two different stages of motives; motives to start and motives to continue the work. The Maynooth-model was developed to illustrate the findings of this research. It shows the interaction and the circuit of the members' motives and influencing framework factors. There is a rather enclosed and complex interaction system, which provides room and questions for further research within the field.

Here it's [...] more of a challenge and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> when we're given a rough outline."

A 1993 Houston Chronicle article described the series' setting as having a [...] "reality that is 'squashed and stretched' into a twisted version of real life". The background staff hand-painted backgrounds with Dr. Martin Dyes, while each episode title card consisted of an original painting. Linda Simensky said that she asked the creators of Rocko's Modern Life about why the women in the series were drawn to be [...] "top-heavy", the creators told her that they believed that drawing women [...] "the traditional way" [...] was easier.
