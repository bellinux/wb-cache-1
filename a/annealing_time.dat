30|$|Also, {{our results}} reveal that strain is {{released}} gradually from double layers of PSi by longer <b>annealing</b> <b>times.</b> This {{was attributed to}} the disappearing of the inter-connections between the porous seed layer and the Si substrate. The exposure to longer <b>annealing</b> <b>times</b> of the double layer of PSi results in fact in a lower density of pillars that, in turn, results in a lower out-of-plane compressive strain.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} presented with experimental confirmation to conclusively demonstrate {{the critical role}} that annealing plays in efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich templates. The analysis {{is focused on the}} annealing of primers at alternative binding sites (competitive annealing) and the main result is a quantitative expression of the efficiency (η) of annealing as a function of temperature (TA), annealing period (tA), and template composition. The optimal efficiency lies in a narrow region of TA and tA for GC-rich templates and a much broader region for normal GC templates. To confirm the theoretical findings, the following genes have been PCR amplified from human cDNA template: ARX and HBB (with 78. 72 % and 52. 99 % GC, respectively). Theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Optimum <b>annealing</b> <b>times</b> for GC-rich genes lie in the range of 3 – 6 s and depend on <b>annealing</b> temperature. <b>Annealing</b> <b>times</b> greater than 10 s yield smeared PCR amplified products.

The price of an optical glass blank of given dimensions can vary by a factor of fifty or more, depending on the size, glass type, index homogeneity quality, and availability, with BK7 usually being the cheapest. Costs for larger and/or thicker optical blanks of a given material, above 100-150 mm, usually increase faster than the physical volume due to increased blank <b>annealing</b> <b>time</b> required to achieve acceptable index homogeneity and internal stress birefringence levels throughout the blank volume.

50|$|Although {{there is}} {{significant}} insight as to how OPVs work, it is still difficult to relate the device’s functionality to local film structures. This difficulty {{may be attributed to}} the minimal current generation at a given point within OPVs. Through pc-AFM, OPV devices can be probed at nano-scale level and can help to increase our fundamental knowledge of mechanisms involved in OPVs at nano-scale level. pc-AFM is capable of gathering information such as the mapping of photocurrents, differences in film morphology, determination of donor-acceptor domains, current density-voltage plots, quantum efficiencies, and approximate charge carrier mobilities. One of the other notable characteristics of pc-AFM is its ability to provide concurrent information regarding the topological and photocurrent properties of the device at nano-scale. Using this concurrent sampling method, the sample handling is minimized and can provide more accurate results. In a study by Pingree et al., pc-AFM was used to measure how spatial deviations in the photocurrent generation developed with different processing techniques. The authors were able to compare these photocurrent variations to the duration of the annealing process. They have concluded that lengthening the <b>annealing</b> <b>time</b> allows for improved nano-scale phase separation as well as created a more ordered device. Actual times for the annealing process vary depending on the properties of the polymers used. The authors have shown that external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels reach a maximum at certain annealing times whereas while the electron and hole mobility’s do not show the corresponding trends. Therefore, while lengthening the <b>annealing</b> <b>time</b> can increase the photocurrents within the OPV, there is a practical limit to after which the benefits may not be substantial.|$|E

Some emerging theories posit that the supersolid signal observed in helium-4 was actually an observation of either a superglass stateor intrinsically superfluid grain boundaries in the helium-4 crystal.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} experimentally as well as theoretically, that quantum annealing can indeed outperform thermal annealing (simulated annealing) in certain cases, especially where the potential energy (cost) landscape consists of very high but thin barriers surrounding shallow local minima.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method for}} preparing high-Tc superconductors is a solid-state thermochemical reaction involving mixing, calcination and sintering. The appropriate amounts of precursor powders, usually oxides and carbonates, are mixed thoroughly using a Ball mill. Solution chemistry {{processes such as}} coprecipitation, freeze-drying and sol-gel methods are alternative ways for preparing a homogeneous mixture. These powders are calcined in the temperature range from 800 °C to 950 °C for several hours. The powders are cooled, reground and calcined again. This process is repeated several times to get homogeneous material. The powders are subsequently compacted to pellets and sintered. The sintering environment such as temperature, <b>annealing</b> <b>time,</b> atmosphere and cooling rate play {{a very important role}} in getting good high-Tc superconducting materials. The YBa2Cu3O7−x compound is prepared by calcination and sintering of a homogeneous mixture of Y2O3, BaCO3 and CuO in the appropriate atomic ratio. Calcination is done at 900-950 °C, whereas sintering is done at 950 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen stoichiometry in this material is very crucial for obtaining a superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x compound. At the time of sintering, the semiconducting tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 compound is formed, which, on slow cooling in oxygen atmosphere, turns into superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x. The uptake and loss of oxygen are reversible in YBa2Cu3O7−x. A fully oxygenated orthorhombic YBa2Cu3O7−x sample can be transformed into tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 by heating in a vacuum at temperature above 700 °C.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{point defect}} {{injection}} study is performed {{to investigate the}} effect of fluorine on boron diffusion when interstitials are injected from the surface. 185 keV, 2. 3 x 1015 cm- 2 F+ is implanted into silicon with a boron marker layer located at about Rp/ 2 of the fluorine implant. This is followed by rapid thermal annealing at 1000 C for times 15 – 120 s in an oxygen ambient.

50|$|Sample {{preparation}} of the OPV is {{of the utmost importance}} when performing pc-AFM studies. The sampling substrate is recommended to be conductive, as well as transparent, to the light source which is irradiated upon it. Numerous studies have used ITO-coated glass as their conductive substrate. Because of high cost of ITO, however, there have been attempts to utilize other semiconducting layers, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and carbon nanotubes as an alternative to ITO. Although these semiconductors are relatively inexpensive, high quality ITO layers are still being used extensively for PV applications. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate), more commonly known as PEDOT:PSS, is a transparent, polymeric conductive layer which is usually placed between the ITO and the active OPV layer. The PEDOT:PSS is a conductive polymer is stable over various applied charges. In most studies, PEDOT:PSS is spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass substrates directly after plasma cleaning of the ITO. Plasma cleaning, as well as halo-acid etching, have been shown to improve the surface uniformity and conductivity of the substrate. This PEDOT:PSS layer is then annealed to the ITO prior to spin-coating the OPV layer onto the substrate. Studies by Pingree et al. have shown the direct correlation between <b>annealing</b> <b>time</b> and both peak and average photocurrent generation. Once this OPV film is spin-coated onto the substrate, it is then annealed at temperatures between 70 and 170 °C, for periods up to an hour depending on the procedure as well as OPV being used.|$|E

This global demand for solar energy increased 54% in 2010, while the United States alone has installed more than 2.3 GW of solar energy sources in 2010. Some of the attributes which make OPVs such a promising candidate {{to solve this problem}} include their low-cost of production, throughput, ruggedness, and their chemically tunable electric properties along with significant reduction in the production of greenhouse gases. For decades, the researchers have believed that the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) would most likely remain below 0.1%. Only in 1979 Tang reported a two-layer, thin-film PV device, which ultimately yielded a power conversion efficiency of 1%. Tang’s research was published in 1986, which allowed others to decipher many of the problems which limited the basic understanding of the process involved in the OPVs. In later years, the majority of the research focused on the composite blend of poly(3-hexylthiopehene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This, along with the research performed on fullerenes, dictated the majority of studies pertaining to OPV for many years. In more recent research, polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells, along with low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers have been created for PCBM-based OPV devices. These low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers are able to absorb a higher percentage of the solar spectrum as compared to other high efficiency polymers. These copolymers have been widely researched due to their ability to be tuned for specific optical and electrical properties.To date, the best OPV devices have a maximum power conversion efficiency of approximately 8.13%. This low power conversion efficiency is directly related to discrepancies in the film morphology on the nano-scale level. Explanations of film morphology include recombination and/or trapping of charges, low open circuit voltages, heterogeneous interfaces, grain boundaries, and phase-separated domains. Many of these problems arise from the deficient knowledge of electro-optical properties on the nano-scale level. In numerous studies, it has been observed that heterogeneities in the electrical and optical properties influence device performance. These heterogeneities which occur in OPVs are a result the manufacturing process, such as <b>annealing</b> <b>time,</b> which is explained below. Research has mainly consisted of discovering exactly how this film morphology affects the device performance.|$|E
