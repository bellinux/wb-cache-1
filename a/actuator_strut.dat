40|$|The {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} Advanced Main Combustion Chamber (AMCC) is presented. The AMCC is an advanced fabrication concept of the Space Shuttle Main Engine main combustion chamber (MCC). Reduced cost and fabrication time of up to 75 percent were {{the goals of the}} AMCC with cast jacket with vacuum plasma sprayed or platelet liner. Since the cast material for the AMCC is much weaker than the wrought material for the MCC, the AMCC is heavier and strength margins much lower in some areas. Proven hand solutions were used to size the manifolds cutout tee areas for combined pressure and applied loads. Detailed finite element strength analyses were used to size the manifolds, longitudinal ribs, and jacket for combined pressure and applied local loads. The design of the gimbal <b>actuator</b> <b>strut</b> attachment lugs were determined by finite element analyses and hand solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{worth of}} models of technical processes {{depends on their}} accuracy, that is, the difference between model outputs and real measurements. For minimizing these differences, process identification methods are used. In this article, coordination software for process identification is presented which has the unique feature that it allows the integration of models that have been created with external tools, for example, Matlab or Python scripts. There {{is no need to}} transform the models into another type of software format to use the common identification coordinator. The concept of the software is described and two examples for the coupling with external simulation software are given. Additionally, this article contains a detailed case study of the parameter identification of two models using that identification coordination software. This highlights the benefit of the new coordination software regarding similar work flow for different model types. The modeled physical subject is the thermal behavior of an <b>actuator</b> <b>strut...</b>|$|E
40|$|Adaptive logic {{networks}} (ALNs) {{were used}} to derive piecewise linear functions to control a non-linear mechanical model of a vehicle active suspension system. ALNs learned relationships among past, present and future states of the sprung mass. Each ALN consisted of a tree of logic gates having linear threshold elements at its leaves. Piecewise linear functions were extracted from the trained ALNs, then the input space was partitioned by a decision tree so {{only a small number}} of linear pieces had to be evaluated to compute any output value. A 486 DX 2 - 66 PC was able to control the test system in real time. The results are applicable to a broad range of real-time control problems. Keywords: vehicle active suspension, non-linear control, adaptive logic network, ALN 1. Introduction: An active suspension system may be used to improve the ride and handling qualities of a vehicle. <b>Actuator</b> <b>struts</b> exert forces controlling the position and orientation of the vehicle body.

40|$|An <b>actuator</b> {{reaction}} <b>strut</b> {{from the}} VC IO aileron power control circuit, made from steel, has been redoslgned, made and tested in carbon {{fibre reinforced plastic}} (CFRP) with aluminium alloy ends, partly to demonstrate the weight saving potential of CFRP {{in this type of}} application and partly to investigate some of the problems of jointing and load diffusion which CFRP presents. The strut has overall axial strength and stiffness requirements in both tension and compression. All have been met with the redeslgned CFRP strut with the exception of tensile stiffness, the low value of which was shown to be fundamental to the form of end attachment adopted. This Report describes the design, fabrication and testing of the CFR...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a class of}} Generalized Gough-Stewart Platforms (GGSPs) used, as a novel approach, to {{eliminate}} the classical isotropic constraint of GSPs (hexapods). GGSPs {{are based on the}} standard GSP architecture with additional rotations of the three strut-pairs. Despite the architectural generalization introduced in GGSPs, they do not require much more effort in order to be fabricated. This {{is due to the fact}} that all the <b>struts</b> (<b>actuators)</b> can be chosen identical, similar to standard GSPs. We analytically show how effectively the classical isotropic constraint is removed and that still sufficient simplicity is retained. Furthermore, this paper gives an intuitive understanding of dynamic isotropy in GGSPs as well as GSPs...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis details the system identification and initial system {{validation of the}} an Ultra-Quiet Vibration Isolation Platform (UQP). With the move toward lighter and more flexible spacecraft, the effects of vibration are of immense concern. As natural or passive damping becomes less effective in controlling undesired vibrations, active vibration control becomes essential. The UQP uses a special configuration of the six degree of freedom Stewart Platform with piezoceramic <b>strut</b> <b>actuators</b> and geophone sensors. This combination gives an extremely sensitive and responsive six degree-of-freedom active vibration control system. Each actuator {{was designed to be}} controlled independently without coupling with other actuators. In order to develop control laws, the plant must be identified in terms of system zeros and poles and the uncoupled design validated. Dynamic modeling using parametric estimation methods can accurately describe a complex system. Using parameter estimation methods, models of the actuator system dynamics were obtained. A simple lead-lag controller was applied to individual actuators then all six actuators acting simultaneously to verify system coupling. Significant interaction between base adjoining actuators was discovered. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The beam string {{structure}} (BSS) {{is a type}} of {{prestressed structure}} and has been widely used in large span structures nowadays. The adaptive BSS is a typical smart structure that can optimize the working status itself by controlling the length of active struts via certain control device. The control device commonly consists of <b>actuators</b> in all <b>struts</b> and sensors on the beam. The key point of the control process is to determine the length adjustment values of actuators according to the data obtained by preinstalled sensors. In this paper, a static control algorithm for adaptive BSS has been presented for the adjustment solution. To begin with, an optimization model of adaptive BSS with multiple active struts is established, which uses a sensitivity analysis method. Next, a linear displacement control process is presented, and the adjustment values of struts are calculated by a simulated annealing algorithm. A nonlinear iteration procedure is used afterwards to calibrate the results of linear calculation. Finally, an example of adaptive BSS under different external loads is carried out to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the algorithm. And the results also show that the adaptive BSS has much better adaptivity and capability than the noncontrolled BSS...|$|R
40|$|The Marine Dynamic Test Facility (MDTF) is a 5 DOF captive {{hydrodynamic}} model test apparatus being jointly procured by the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). This apparatus (Fig. 1) {{is being built}} by Bombardier Inc. of Montreal {{and is expected to}} be commissioned by late 1997. To be installed in the towing tank (Fig. 2) of NRC's Institute for Marine Dynamics (IMD) in St. John's, Newfoundland, this apparatus can oscillate a captive model in any arbitrary combination of heave, picth, surge and swat motions through electrically driven actuators. A submarine model will generally be sting-mounted and can be rotated in roll using a hydraulic <b>actuator.</b> The alternative <b>strut</b> mounting option is also available both for surface ships and submarines, particularly when propulsion systems are to be installed in the latter (Fig. 3). The missing 6 th DOF, namely the surge motion, as well as surge correction, can be provided by the towing carriage itself, which is computer controlled. Between the MDTF and the recently acquired PMM for IMD's ice tank, a whole range of captive tests can now be done {{for a wide range of}} ship types. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Scientists on {{one type}} of solar kite take pride {{that there will be}} a minimum of moving parts to control the {{movement}} of the solar kite through space and around the earth, moon, comet, or other solar system body. ESA CONTRACT 17679/03/NL/SFe Solar Kite Mission Feasibility Study EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Authors: C. Jack and C. Welch A collection of scientists and engineers are expanding the definition of what is a kite; the solar kite described by authors C. Jack and C. Welch has the inertia of the mass of the kite providing resistance against photonic flow; also, the controlling of the kite to alter the kite's acceleration sets up a kiting scenario: cause the kite to deflect away from the pull of gravity to keep the kite flying intended path supports the inclusion of the solar sail as a kite in photonic flow. The kite is fed start data; the kite tracks the stars and operates three elements to control its attitude to effect its deflections to result in the flight path desired by the ground-directing kite operators. The position of the payload is changed to alter the relative positions of the kite's center of pressure and center of mass; this is done in part by piezoelectric <b>actuators.</b> Also, the <b>struts</b> that hold the centered payload are differentially heated; such causes one of the struts to become longer than the cooler struts and thereby changing the center of mass relative to the center of pressure of the kite. Further, to cause an attitude change, tiny photo thrusters (heated wire) tweak the attitude of the kite; such thrusters do not propel the kite, but are only used to change the attitude of the kite's sail. These mechanisms aim to give authoritative control at minimum power use for giving direction to the kite. Working solar kite groups are considering at least seventeen means of control of the solar kite/solar sail. West Group. Solar sail designing including a list of control options.|$|R
