50|$|An <b>atmometer</b> {{is fairly}} easy to install and use. It is usually mounted on a wooden post about 40 ins above the ground in an area {{representative}} of the weather and field conditions. The plate of the <b>atmometer</b> should be placed in direct sunlight so the evaporation rates are not affected. It should not be placed near tall trees or buildings, as they can affect the amount of exposure that the <b>atmometer</b> has to environmental factors, which affect evapotraspiration rates. To measure {{the amount of water}} that has evaporated, calculate the change in water level on the gauge by subtracting the final water level from the initial water level.|$|E
50|$|An <b>atmometer</b> is also {{fairly easy}} to maintain. Salts can {{accumulate}} in the ceramic plate, so only distilled water should be poured into the reservoir to prevent the accumulation of these salts. Any salts that do accumulate can affect evapotranspiration rates, so it is best regularly check the ceramic plate. During the winter, freezing can cause damage and malfunctions to the <b>atmometer,</b> so it should be placed indoors to prevent any harm. Dust and other particles can build up in the canvas cover, so it should be cleaned about twice a month. Spikes placed on the <b>atmometer</b> prevent any birds or other animals from interfering with its performance. The most accurate and consistent results are produced by reading the gauge {{around the same time}} each day, preferably early in the morning (8:00 A.M.).|$|E
50|$|In a 2003 study {{conducted}} on the Central Coast of California, the performance of <b>atmometers</b> was {{compared with that of}} the more expensive weather stations. <b>Atmometers</b> were placed adjacent to seven weather stations around the area and weekly values were recorded for each method. The results indicated that the <b>atmometers</b> and weather stations yielded very similar results, both producing comparable evapotranspiration (ET) readings. Under conditions of lower evapotranspiration, the <b>atmometers</b> produced slightly lower ET values than those of the weather stations. Studies conducted by Colorado State University and the United States Department of Agriculture in Fort Collins produced similar results. The <b>atmometers</b> produced evapotranspiration values that were very close to the data calculated from weather stations. These studies show that <b>atmometers</b> are especially useful for areas that {{do not have access to}} nearby weather stations and/or evapotranspiration data.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 A {{weather station}} was {{established}} {{on the dock}} of the Oregon State University Marine Science Center, Yaquina Bay, Oregon. A total of 197 weather observations was made from 30 June 1966 to 23 September 1966, with emphasis on {{the determination of the}} rate of evaporation from an evaporation pan and from <b>atmometers.</b> Sources of observational error were investigated and corrections applied as necessary. The daily variation in evaporation was determined. The correlation between wind, vapor pressure, and evaporation was found. <b>Atmometers</b> were used to estimate the evaporation from the surface of Yaquina Bay, and the possibility of using <b>atmometers</b> at sea was investigated...|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} {{model of}} the <b>atmometer</b> is also available, which includes a data logger attached to it. A data logger automatically records the level of water every time a change due to evaporation occurs. The data that the data logger records can be downloaded onto a computer to record the results. The electronic model eliminates possible human error that could occur from reading the gauge, but costs approximately $900 while the manual model costs approximately $300.|$|E
50|$|An <b>atmometer</b> {{consists}} of a porous, ceramic plate connected to a water reservoir by a glass or plastic tube. The device stands around 1.5 - 2 ft tall with a diameter of 3 - 4 in. Water is drawn from the water reservoir through the tube to wet the plate. As the water on the plate evaporates, more water is drawn from the reservoir to re-wet the plate. A canvas cover made of Gore-Tex is placed over the plate to prevent anything from getting in. The canvas cover {{is important because it}} simulates the amount of solar radiation a plant absorbs under certain weather conditions and controls the rate of evaporation. Different types of canvas covers simulate different amounts of evapotranspiration rates that various plant surfaces would undergo. For example, alfalfa ET rates are estimated using the No. 54 green canvas cover, while grass ET rates are estimated using the No. 30 green canvas cover. A membrane between the plate and canvas cover prevents rain water from wetting the gauge yet allows water vapor to escape. A gauge that runs {{up the side of the}} <b>atmometer</b> measures the level of water (in inches) in the reservoir, which shows how much water has evaporated.|$|E
50|$|An <b>atmometer</b> or {{evaporimeter}} is {{a scientific}} instrument used {{for measuring the}} rate of water evaporation from a wet surface to the atmosphere. Atmometers are mainly used by farmers and growers to measure evapotranspiration (ET) rates of crops at any field location. Evapotranspiration {{is a measure of}} all of the water that evaporates from land surfaces plus the water that transpires from plant surfaces. Based on the amount of water that does evaporate and transpire, the user can water crops correspondingly, which results in less water use and possibly increased crop yields. Companies that currently sell atmometers include C&M Meteorological Supply and Calsense.|$|E
40|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ETref) is used {{to determine}} the actual water use (ETa) rate for various crops {{and is one of the}} key variables that needs to be determined accurately for effective irrigation management. This extension circular provides information on the magnitude and temporal distribution of daily, monthly, annual, and growing season alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ETref)) in south central Nebraska. It also discusses why long-term average ETref values may not represent non-average years or be accurate enough for irrigation management. The most common way to calculate actual crop water use (ETa) for a given agronomic crop is to use the ETref and crop coeffi cient (Kc) approach (i. e., ETa = ETref x Kc). This is described in detail in the UNL Extension NebGuide Estimating Crop Evapotranspiration from Reference Evapotranspiration and Crop Coefficients (G 1994). This NebGuide also presents information about sources of local ETref and crop coefficients. ETref can either be measured directly using advanced evaporative flux measurement systems, including <b>atmometers</b> (ETgage™), or calculated from weather variables such as solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.

Undoubtedly this increase in aridity {{is due to the}} increased temperature and the decreased humidity of the air above the black, heat-absorbing ground, and to the accelerated rate of air-flow.|$|R

40|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ET 0) estimations require {{accurate measurements}} of meteorological variables (solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) {{which are not}} available in many countries of the world. Alternative approaches are the use of Class A pan evaporimeters and atmometers, which have several advantages compared to meteorological stations: they are simple, inexpensive and provide a visual interpretation of ET 0. The objectives {{of the study were}} to compare the evaporation from atmometers (ETgage) with the evapotranspiration estimated by the FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith equation (ET 0 PM) and to evaluate the variability between three modified atmometers of a commercial model. Comparison between daily ETgage measured by the <b>atmometer</b> and ET 0 PM showed a good correlation. However, ETgage underestimated ET 0 PM by approximately 9 %. Differences between ETgage and ET 0 PM ranged from - 2. 4 to 2. 2  mm d- 1 while the mean bias error was - 0. 41  mm d- 1. Underestimations occurred more frequently on days with low maximum temperatures and high wind speeds. On the contrary, <b>atmometer</b> overestimations occurred on days with high maximum temperatures and low wind speeds.

40|$|Abstract Research was {{conducted}} in northern Colorado in 2011 to estimate the crop water stress index (CWSI) and actual transpiration (Ta) of maize under a range of irriga-tion regimes. The main goal was to obtain these parameters with minimum instrumentation and measurements. The results confirmed that empirical baselines required for CWSI calculation are transferable within regions with similar climatic conditions, eliminating {{the need to develop}} them for each irrigation scheme. This means that maize CWSI can be determined using only two instruments: an infrared thermometer and an air temperature/relative humidity sensor. Reference evapotranspiration data obtained from a modified <b>atmometer</b> were similar to those estimated at a standard weather station, suggesting that maize Ta can be calculated based on CWSI and by adding one additional instrument: a modified <b>atmometer.</b> Esti-mated CWSI during four hourly periods centered on solar noon was largest during the 2 h after solar noon. Hence, this time window is recommended for once-a-day data acquisition if the goal is to capture maximum stress level. Maize Ta based on CWSI during the first hourly period (10 : 00 – 11 : 00) was closest to Ta estimates from a widely used crop coefficient model. Thus, this time window is recommended if the goal is to monitor maize water use. Average CWSI over the 2 h after solar noon and during the study period (early August to late September, 2011) was 0. 19, 0. 57, and 0. 20 for plots under full, low-frequency deficit, and high-frequency deficit irrigation regimes, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Greenhouse {{cultivation}} is a steadily developing {{agricultural sector}} throughout the world. In addition, {{it is known}} that water is a major issue almost all part of the world especially for countries which have insufficient water source. With this great expansion of greenhouse cultivation, the need of appropriate irrigation management has a great importance. Accurate determination of irrigation scheduling (irrigation timing and frequency) {{is one of the main}} factors in achieving high yields and avoiding loss of quality in greenhouse tomato and cucumber. To do this, it is fundamental to know the crop water requirements or real evapotranspiration. Accurate estimation on crop water requirement is needed to avoid the excess or deficit water application, with consequent impacts on nutrient availability for plants. This can be done by using appropriate method to determine the crop evapotranspiration (ETc). In greenhouse cultivation, crop transpiration is the most important energy dissipation mechanisms that influence ETc rate. There are a large number of literatures on methods to estimate ETc in greenhouses. ETc can be measured or estimated by direct or indirect methods. The most common direct method estimates ETc from measurements with weighing lysimeters. Thisalsoincludes the evaporation measuring equipment, class A pan, Piche <b>atmometer</b> and modified <b>atmometer.</b> Indirect method includes the measurement of net radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and air vapour pressure deficit. A large number of models have been developed from these measurements to estimate ETc. Due to the fast development of under greenhouse cultivation all around the world, the needs of information on how it affects ETc in greenhouses has to be known and summarized. The existing models for ETc calculation have to be studied to know whether it is reliable for greenhouse climate (hereafter, microclimate) or not. Regression and artificial neural network models are two important models to estimate ETc in greenhouse. The inputs of these models are net radiation, temperature, day after planting and air vapour pressure deficit (or relative humidity). Materials and Methods: In this study, daily ETc of reference crop, greenhouse tomato and cucumber crops were measured using lysimeter method in Urmia region. Several linear, nonlinear regressions and artificial neural networks were considered for ETc modelling in greenhouse. For this purpose, the effective meteorological parameters on ETc process includes: air temperature (T), air humidity (RH), air pressure (P), air vapour pressure deficit (VPD), day after planting (N) and greenhouse net radiation (SR) were considered and measured. According to the goodness of fit, different models of artificial neural networks and regression were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, based on partial derivatives of regression models, sensitivity analysis was conducted. The accuracy and performance of the employed models was judged by ten statistical indices namely root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2). Results and Discussion: Based on the results, the most accurate regression model to reference ETc prediction was obtained three variables exponential function of VPD, RH and SR with RMSE= 0. 378 mm day- 1. The RMSE of optimal artificial neural network to reference ET prediction for train and test data sets were obtained 0. 089 and 0. 365 mm day- 1, respectively. The performance of logarithmic and exponential functions to prediction of cucumber ETc were proper, with high dependent variables especially, and the most accurate regression model to cucumber ET prediction was obtained for exponential function of five variables: VPD, N, T, RH and SR with RMSE= 0. 353 mm day- 1. In addition, for tomato ET prediction, the most accurate regression model was obtained for exponential function of four variables: VPD, N, RH and SR with RMSE= 0. 329 mm day- 1. The best performance of artificial neural network for ET prediction of cucumber and tomato were obtained with five inputs include: VPD, N, T, RH and SR. The RMSE values of test data sets for cucumber and tomato ET were obtained 0. 24 and 0. 26 mm day- 1. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis results showed that VPD is the most sensitive parameter on ETc. Conclusion: The greenhouse industry has expanded across many parts of the word and the need of information on a reliable ETc method especially by indirect method is crucial. In this research, the artificial neural network models indicated good performance compared with linear and nonlinear regressions. The evaluated method could be used for scheduling irrigation of greenhouse tomato and cucumber...|$|E
40|$|The newly {{developed}} SoilClim model is introduced {{as a tool}} for estimates of reference (ETo) and actual (ETa) evapotranspiration, presence of snow cover, soil temperature at 0. 5 Â m depth and the soil moisture course within two defined layers. It enables one to determine the soil moisture and temperature regimes according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil taxonomy. SoilClim works with daily time steps and requires maximum and minimum air temperature, global solar radiation, precipitation, vapor pressure and wind speed as meteorological inputs as well as basic information about the soil properties and vegetation cover. The behavior of SoilClim was assessed using observations at 5 stations in central Europe and 15 stations in the central U. S. The modeled ETo was compared with atmometers so that the coefficient of determination (R 2) was 0. 91 and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0. 53 Â mm. The estimated ETa was compared against eddy-covariance and Bowen ratio measurements (R 2 varied from 0. 74 to 0. 80; RMSE varied from 0. 49 to 0. 58 Â mm). The soil temperature (at 0. 5 Â m depth) was estimated with good accuracy (R 2 varied from 0. 94 to 0. 97; RMSE varied from 1. 23 Â Â°C to 2. 95 Â Â°C). The ability of the SoilClim model to mimic the observed soil water dynamics was carefully investigated (relative root mean square error rRMSE varied from 2. 8 % to 34. 0 %). The analysis conducted showed that SoilClim gives reasonable estimates of evaluated parameters at a majority of the included stations. Finally, a spatial analysis of soil moisture and temperature regimes (according to USDA) within the region of the Czech Republic and the northern part of Austria under present conditions was conducted and diagnosed the appearance of Perudic, Subhumid Udic, Dry Tempudic (the highest frequency), Wet Tempustic and Typic Tempustic. The simulated mean soil temperature (0. 5 Â m depth) varied from less than 7. 0 Â Â°C to 11. 0 Â Â°C throughout this region. Based on these results, the SoilClim model is a useful and suitable tool for water balance and soil climate assessment on local and regional scales.

FryResearchers and {{practitioners}} can use numerous techniques to measure or estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from turfgrass but {{little is known}} about how they compare to ET using standard lysimeters. An investigation was conducted to compare measurements of ET from lysimeters (LYS[subscript]E[subscript]T) with ET estimates from the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (PM[subscript]E[subscript]T) and Priestley-Taylor (PT[subscript]E[subscript]T) empirical models, atmometers (AT[subscript]E[subscript]T), eddy covariance (EC[subscript]E[subscript]T), and a canopy stomatal conductance model that estimates transpiration (COND[subscript]T). Methods were compared at the same site during the 2010, 2011, and 2012 growing seasons. Overall, PT[subscript]E[subscript]T and EC[subscript]E[subscript]T were not different from LYS[subscript]E[subscript]T, whereas PM[subscript]E[subscript]T, AT[subscript]E[subscript]T, and COND[subscript]T, increasingly underestimated LYS[subscript]E[subscript]T. Differences exist among ET measurement techniques and one should employ the technique that best fits their situation. An <b>atmometer</b> is an inexpensive tool {{that can be used to}} measure turfgrass ET within microclimates, such as those typically found in an urban home lawn. An investigation was conducted to compare AT[subscript]E[subscript]T estimates with PM[subscript]E[subscript]T estimates within a number of lawn microclimates. Home lawns in Manhattan and Wichita, KS, were selected for study during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Open sward AT[subscript]E[subscript]T was 4. 73 mm d[superscript]-[superscript] 1, whereas PM[subscript]E[subscript]T was 5. 48 mm d[superscript]-[superscript] 1. Within microclimates, AT[subscript]E[subscript]T was 3. 94 mm d[superscript]-[superscript] 1 and PM[subscript]E[subscript]T 3. 23 mm d[superscript]-[superscript] 1. Atmometers can provide practitioners with reliable estimates of PM[subscript]E[subscript]T within microclimates. Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) is a common turfgrass used on home lawns and golf courses. However, poor shade tolerance and cold hardiness have limited its use in the transition zone. A study was conducted to determine changes and differences in growth and physiology among selected Zoysia over a three-year period (2010 - 2012) in the transition zone. The genotypes were 'Emerald' [Z. japonica × Z. pacifica], 'Zorro' [Z. matrella], 'Meyer' and Chinese Common [Z. japonica], and experimental progeny Exp 1 [Z. matrella × Z. japonica], and Exp 2 and Exp 3 [(Z. japonica × Z. pacifica) × Z. japonica]. 'Zorro' and 'Emerald' experienced winter injury. 'Meyer', Chinese Common, and Exp 1 showed poor performance over the three-years. The Exp 2 and Exp 3 progeny, maintained high percent cover, visual quality, and tiller density, and may provide practitioners more shade-tolerant cultivar choices in the transition zone...|$|E
40|$|A study, {{extending}} over a 4 -year period, {{has been}} made to determine the effect of environmental factors on the response of corn plants grown under field conditions. The principal factors of the environment which were measured were available soil moisture, air temperature, evaporation and relative humidity. Factors of the environment, during each growing season, were further modified by varying the rate of planting from one to five plants per hill. Height of plants, increase in leaf area, size of stalks, dry weight of vegetative and reproductive parts, rate of photosynthesis, carbohydrate fractions of leaf samples, and nitrogen content of the ears were measured at regular intervals throughout the growing season. The relation between the plant responses and environmental factors, particularly as modified by rate of planting, was studied. The rainfall of the growing season, May, June, July and August, is a better criterion for predicting corn yield than the rainfall of the entire year. Where corn was planted one to five plants per hill there was usually less available soil moisture in the thicker rates of planting than in the thinner rates. The difference was greater in July and August during periods without rain. During the day relative humidity was 3 to 5 percent lower where plants were planted one plant per hill than where planted five plants per hill. At night the relative humidity was higher in the thinner rates of planting. The rate of evaporation from porous porcelain <b>atmometer</b> cups in cubic centimeters was 22 percent greater during July and August where there was one plant per hill than where there were five plants. Height of the corn plants was not appreciably influenced by rate of planting. There was considerable difference in the leaf area per plant from different rates of planting. In 1932 the maximum leaf area, per plant, was 8, 900, 7, 908 and 6, 573 square centimeters respectively where there were one, three and five plants per hill. Loss of effective leaf area due to firing began earlier and proceeded at a more rapid rate in the thicker rates of planting. At maturity the average cross-sectional area, {{at the level of the}} ground, of stalks, where there were three plants per hill, was 60 percent as large as where there was one plant. Stalks planted, five plants per hill, were only 40 percent as large as where there was one plant. One hundred hills with one, three and five plants per hill produced a total of 141, 265 and 359 ears, respectively, in 1932. The same year 42 percent of the ears were less than 15 centimeters long- 2 ̆ 2 nubbins 2 ̆ 2 -where there were five plants per hill, while -only 12 percent of the ears were 2 ̆ 2 nubbins 2 ̆ 2 where there was one plant per hill. Rate of planting does not significantly influence the rate of food making per unit of leaf area as determined by increase in dry weight of leaf samples collected at 4 : 30 a. m. and 4 p. m. Data from these experiments show that rate of food making is proportional to area and not to dry weight of leaf samples. The quantity of alcohol-soluble carbohydrate fractions separated as diastase extract, dextrins and acid hydrolyzable were determined for leaf samples collected at 4 : 30 a. m. and 4 p. m. the same day from different rates of planting. There was a statistically significant difference in the non-reducing sugars and diastase extract between samples from different rates of planting and in the reducing and non-reducing sugars, and acid hydrolyzable between samples collected at 4 : 30 a. m. and 4 p. m. An analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in the quantity of nitrogen in kernel and cob samples attributable to date of collection. There was no significant difference in the quantity of nitrogen in the kernels attributable to rate of planting, while the quantity in the cob samples was slightly significant...|$|E
