50|$|The <b>AMA</b> Education <b>system</b> has sister schools. Unlike the Quezon City campus, whose land {{is wholly}} owned, {{some of the}} campuses are on rented real estate. The campuses are overseen and {{monitored}} by government departments, such Department of Education (DepEd), Technical Skills and Development Authority (TESDA), Commission on Higher Education and the Philippine Maritime and Naval Agency (MARINA), for Norwegian Maritime Institute. Student population mainly determine the longevity of the campuses. Only the main campus of AMA, in Project 8, is accredited with a University status; all else are under study for proper accreditation.|$|R
30|$|Technological {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of transportation and communication is happening at a faster pace in the past few decades. As the demand for high-speed transportation increases, the need for an improved seamless communication system to handle higher data traffic in a highly mobile environment becomes imperative. This paper proposes a novel scheme to enhance the quality of service in high-speed railway (HSR) communication environment using the concept of torch nodes (TNs) and adaptive measurement aggregation (<b>AMA).</b> The <b>system</b> was modeled using an object-oriented discrete event simulator, and the performance was analyzed against the existing single-antenna scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme with its minimal implementation overhead can efficiently perform seamless handover with reduced handover failure and communication interruption probability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of AMA {{in the blood}} or serum of a person may be indicative of the {{presence of}}, or the potential to develop, the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; also known as primary biliary cholangitis). PBC causes scarring of liver tissue, confined primarily to the bile duct drainage <b>system.</b> <b>AMA</b> is present in about 95% of cases. [...] PBC is seen primarily in middle-aged women, and in those afflicted with other autoimmune diseases.|$|R
40|$|AbstractComputational {{science has}} benefited {{in the last}} years from {{emerging}} accelerators that increase the performance of scientific simulations, but using these devices hinders the programming task. This paper presents AMA: a set of optimization techniques to efficiently manage multi-accelerator <b>systems.</b> <b>AMA</b> maximizes the overlap of computation and communication in a blocking-free way. Then, we can use such spare time to do other work while waiting for device operations. Implemented on top of a task-based framework, the experimental evaluation of AMA on a quad-GPU node shows that we reach the performance of a hand-tuned native CUDA code, with the advantage of fully hiding the device management. In addition, we obtain up to more than 2 x performance speed-up with respect to the original framework implementation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} proof system for Multipoint Arithmetic Circuit Evaluation: for every arithmetic circuit C(x_ 1, [...] .,x_n) of size s and degree d over a field F, and any inputs a_ 1, [...] .,a_K in F^n, - the Prover sends the Verifier the values C(a_ 1), [...] ., C(a_K) in F and a proof of O(K * d) length, and - the Verifier tosses poly(log(dK|F|epsilon)) coins and can check the proof in about O(K * (n + d) + s) time, with {{probability of error}} less than epsilon. For small degree d, this "Merlin-Arthur" proof system (a. k. a. MA-proof system) runs in nearly-linear time, and has many applications. For example, we obtain MA-proof systems that run in c^n time (for various c < 2) for the Permanent, #Circuit-SAT for all sublinear-depth circuits, counting Hamiltonian cycles, and infeasibility of 0 - 1 linear programs. In general, the value of any polynomial in Valiant 2 Ì† 7 s class VP can be certified faster than "exhaustive summation" over all possible assignments. These results strongly refute a Merlin-Arthur Strong ETH and Arthur-Merlin Strong ETH posed by Russell Impagliazzo and others. We also give a three-round (<b>AMA)</b> proof <b>system</b> for quantified Boolean formulas running in 2 ^ 2 n/ 3 +o(n) time, nearly-linear time MA-proof systems for counting orthogonal vectors in a collection and finding Closest Pairs in the Hamming metric, and a MA-proof system running in n^k/ 2 +O(1) -time for counting k-cliques in graphs. We point to some potential future directions for refuting the Nondeterministic Strong ETH...|$|R
40|$|The Waikoropupu Springs, a large karst {{resurgence}} 4 km {{from the}} coast, are {{supplied by the}} Arthur Marble Aquifer (AMA) underlying the Takaka Valley, South Island, New Zealand. New evidence on the recharge sources in the catchment, combined with previous results, is used {{to establish a new}} recharge model for the AMA. Combined with the oxygen- 18 mass balance, this yields a quantitative description of the inputs and outputs to the aquifer. It shows that the Main Spring is sourced mainly from the karst uplands (74 %), with smaller contributions from the Upper Takaka River (18 %) and valley rainfall (8 %), while Fish Creek Spring contains mostly Upper Takaka River water (50 %). In addition, much of the Upper Takaka River contribution to the aquifer (58 %) bypasses the springs and is discharged offshore via submarine springs. The chemical concentrations of the Main Spring show input of 0. 5 % of sea water on average, which varies with flow and derives from the deep aquifer. Tritium measurements spanning 40 years, and CFC- 11 measurements, give a mean residence time of 8 years for the Main Spring water using the preferred two-component model. Our conceptual flow model, based on the flow, chloride, oxygen- 18 and age measurements, invokes two different flow systems with different recharge sources to explain the flow within the <b>AMA.</b> One <b>system</b> contains deeply penetrating old water with mean age 10. 2 years and water volume 3 km 3, recharged from the karst uplands. The other, at shallow levels below the valley floor, has much younger water, with mean age 1. 2 years and water volume 0. 4 km 3, recharged by Upper Takaka River and valley rainfall. The flow systems contribute in different proportions to the Main Spring, Fish Creek Springs and offshore springs. Their very different behaviours, despite being in the same aquifer, are attributed to the presence of a diorite intrusive {{below the surface of the}} lower valley, which diverts the deep flow towards the Waikoropupu Springs and allows much of the shallow flow to pass over the intrusive and escape via submarine springs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article briefly {{describes}} {{the history of}} formal CME/CPD in the US and the significant work that has developed into major advances {{in the field of}} CME, including innovative learning formats by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association as the three organizations that own the three major CME credit systems. The description of these advances include the evolution, although not yet completed, from a time metric to a value metric as the way to quantify involvement in CME on the part of physicians. It also briefly describes how the credit systems have evolved from accepting participation to requiring a higher level of achievement or active involvement in the activity in order to receive CME credit. It then highlights Performance Improvement CME as one of the learning formats recognized for CME credit. Each of the three CME credit systems offers multiple ways for physicians to earn CME credit and many, but not all, can be found in all three of them. As an example, the list of different ways to receive credit under the <b>AMA</b> CME credit <b>system</b> is provided. The article goes on to describe how the specialty certification philosophy has evolved, using the American Boards of Medical Specialties (ABMS) as an example, from a lifetime certificate for most specialties to an ongoing engagement with educational activities and quality improvement efforts to maintain certification. The role that CME/CPD plays in that philosophy is also described. It then discusses the current licensing system in the US, the changes that have been proposed by the Federation of Medical Boards and the possible role of CME/CPD in this new framework as well. The article concludes with a reference to the research evidence in support of the effectiveness of CME/CPD and the impact that Continuous Quality Improvement and Performance Improvement have had on CME/CPD, on the new program to maintain specialty certification and on the proposed new licensure framework, and how they all interact...|$|R
