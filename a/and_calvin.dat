5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} {{confession}} of faith, <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> wrote separate articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the Eucharist, the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement {{to subscribe to the}} confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, Calvin adapted {{a service}} book used in Strasbourg, {{publishing}} La Forme des Prières et Chants Ecclésiastiques (The Form of Prayers and Church Hymns). Calvin recognised {{the power of}} music and he intended that it be used to support scripture readings. The original Strasbourg psalter contained twelve psalms by Clément Marot <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> added several more hymns of his own composition in the Geneva version. At the end of 1542, Marot became a refugee in Geneva and contributed nineteen more psalms. Louis Bourgeois, also a refugee, lived and taught music in Geneva for sixteen years <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> {{took the opportunity to}} add his hymns, the most famous being the Old Hundredth.|$|E

5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, {{had made}} peace with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, and again sought New York state office. In July, however, he was drafted by the Democratic National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} that he was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's calling. A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> would visit the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33-3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team slid to finish 7-6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey was fired from the Yellow Jackets, two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Farel <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> {{then went}} to Bern and Zurich to plead their case. The {{resulting}} synod in Zurich placed most of the blame on Calvin for not being sympathetic enough toward the people of Geneva. It asked Bern to mediate {{with the aim of}} restoring the two ministers. The Geneva council refused to readmit the two men, who then took refuge in Basel. Subsequently, Farel received an invitation to lead the church in Neuchâtel. Calvin was invited to lead a church of French refugees in Strasbourg by that city's leading reformers, Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito. Initially, Calvin refused because Farel {{was not included in the}} invitation, but relented when Bucer appealed to him. By September 1538 Calvin had taken up his new position in Strasbourg, fully expecting that this time it would be permanent; a few months later, he applied for and was granted citizenship of the city.|$|E
5|$|Francis J. Underwood {{was born}} on November 5, 1959, to Catherine <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, {{with the threat of}} bank {{foreclosure}} on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into Harvard Law School. He graduated from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had a homosexual relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet, which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian but holds God in complete contempt.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech has {{had several}} players receive {{votes in the}} Heisman Trophy balloting. Eddie Prokop {{finished}} fifth in the 1943 Heisman voting, Lenny Snow finished 14th in the 1966 voting, Eddie Lee Ivery finished 8th in the 1978 voting, <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> Johnson finished 10th in the 2006 voting. Billy Lothridge is the only Tech player to receive votes in multiple years. He was 8th in 1962 and runner-up in 1963. Clint Castleberry was the only freshman {{in the history of}} the Heisman to finish as high as third until Herschel Walker's third-place finish in 1980. Castleberry and Walker, however, were both surpassed in 2004 by true freshman Adrian Peterson's Heisman runner-up season. Joe Hamilton tied Lothridge's runner-up status in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In another story, Stowe <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> Harris.|$|E
5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith. On 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during the Easter service. This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told Farel <b>and</b> <b>Calvin</b> to leave Geneva.|$|E
