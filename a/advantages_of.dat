5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E

5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it {{is susceptible to}} many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a new theoretical approach in solving the result of research gap between the effects of organizasional learning influence towards organizational performance and analyze the development of Orientation On The <b>Advantage</b> <b>Of</b> Specific Creative Technique. Sources of orientation on the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> specific creative technique derived from the concept of the specifc firms resources. The research was conducted in the area Pekalongan, Rembang, Sragen, Banjarnegara, and Solo in Central Java Province. The empirical test model used was Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by using some software, such as: AMOS 7. 0, SPSS 16. 0 and Microsoft Excel version. 2007. The sample size of the study was 200 owners/ leaders/ managers of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. The results showed that learning explorative affect positively towards <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> new product development, innovation creativity affect positively towards <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> product differentiation, exploitative learning affect positively towards <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the creative process-oriented cost. Furthermore, <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> new product development, <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> product differentiation, <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the creative process- oriented cost affect positively towards organizational performance. This study contributes to the Resources-Based Theory, and Organizational learning Theory. Organizational learning theory provides an explanation explorative learning, exploitative learning, and creativity to the realm of Resources Based Theory, which is the realm of capabilities and orientation on the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> specific creative technique which is a competitive advantage in an organizational performance. Limitations and implications for future research and managerial implications are also discussed in this study...|$|R

5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{linezolid}} is {{its high}} bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it}} had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E

50|$|In general, sexual {{reproduction}} in eukaryotes has two fundamental aspects: recombination during meiosis, and outcrossing. It {{has been proposed}} that these two aspects have two natural selective advantages respectively. A proposed adaptive <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> meiosis is that it facilitates recombinational repair of DNA damages that are otherwise difficult to repair (see DNA repair as the adaptive <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> meiosis). A proposed adaptive <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> outcrossing is complementation, which is the masking of deleterious recessive alleles (see hybrid vigor or heterosis). The selective <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> complementation may largely account for the general avoidance of inbreeding (see kin recognition).|$|R
5|$|Other <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{using an}} {{electric}} fire engine were {{that it would}} not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did. Also, the cost of an electric fire engine would be about one-third that of a steam boiler fire engine. A typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity.|$|E

5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E

The Ducati 350XL was produced by Ducati to quickly take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a tax break. The Moto Guzzi 1000S is another example.|$|R
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E
