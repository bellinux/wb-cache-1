500|$|Ruthenium, {{like the}} other {{platinum}} group metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel, and copper, and platinum metals ore processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold, and the platinum group metals precipitate as anode mud, the feedstock for the extraction. The metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods, depending on {{the composition of the}} feedstock. [...] One representative method is fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and solution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium are insoluble in aqua regia and readily precipitate, leaving the other metals in solution. Rhodium is separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate. The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os, and Ir is treated with sodium oxide, in which Ir is insoluble, producing dissolved Ru and Os salts. After oxidation to the volatile oxides, [...] is separated from [...] by precipitation of (NH4)3RuCl6 with ammonium chloride or by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. Hydrogen is used to reduce ammonium ruthenium chloride yielding a powder. The product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge metal that can be treated with powder metallurgy techniques or <b>argon-arc</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E

The {{results show}} that the Cu/Ti 3 AlC 2 cermet can be joined firmly. The joining strength at room temperature was measured to be 851 MPa after optimization of the welding parameters with 2. 6 A/mm 2 for arc current density, 5 s for arc time, 10. 8 kPa for applied pressure and 12 V for arc voltage. The microstructure in welded zone shows that fine TiCx particles uniformly dispersed in a network structure of Cu-Al alloys. This feature endows the Cu/Ti 3 AlC 2 cermet with the high joining strength...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were made on}} the fatigue behavior and life prediction for <b>argon-arc</b> <b>welded</b> titanium alloy joints, TA 15. High cycle fatigue tests at two stress ratios, R= 0. 5 and 0. 06, were carried out on smooth specimens with the <b>argon-arc</b> <b>weld</b> joint located at the specimen center section. Through macroscopic observation and SEM fractographic analysis, {{it was found that}} most of the cracks were initiated at weld defects such as voids and inclusions at the edge of weld and in the heat affected zone (HAZ). A small crack methodology based on the plasticity-induced crack-closure concept and the effective stress intensity factor range, Keff, was used to predict the total fatigue life of the weld joints. Large crack growth curve for cracks in the HAZ area was employed as the da/dN-Keff base-line of the TA 15 alloy. From fractographic measurements, an average defect size of 100 microns was assumed as the initial small crack size in the life predictions. Predicted total fatigue life by solely considering small crack growth stage agreed well with the experimental data...|$|R

The structure of the fused coating consists of dendrites on which borders the boride eutectic is located. It is established that the content of chrome in dendrites is 1, 5 – 1, 6 times less than in the borid; {{distribution of}} copper on structure is uniformed.

40|$|Depending on type of material, {{activity}} level, {{and fire}} and health hazard, several methods of waste and fuel packaging {{are used in}} the Hot Cells at Kernforschungsanlage Jülich (KFA). Low level wastes such as plastics, rags, and small tools are remotely welded into plastic bags of 0. 2 - 0. 4 mm thickness. Wastes of higher activity level are packed into disposable cans. Tests of the tightness of the containers are described. For highly-active fuel wastes which must be most securely packaged and stored, three methods have been tested: 1.) remote <b>argon-arc</b> <b>welding</b> of stainless-steel and aluminum cans 2.) electromagnetic closing of aluminum cans 3.) cold-pressure welding of aluminum cans. By comparison of leak-tightness, resistance to mechanical damage. and costs, the method of cold-pressure welding has been chosen...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{mathematical}} model of kinematics {{of a plastic}} shaping at the sinking of a thin-walled precision pipe applied to calibration of {{the ends of the}} unified elements of the pipeline of aircraft from titanic alloys and corrosion-resistant steel before assembly to the route by means of automatic <b>argon-arc</b> <b>welding</b> of ring joints is developed. For modeling, the power criterion of stability with use of kinematic possible fields of speeds is applied to receiving the top assessment of effort of deformation. The developed model of kinematics of a plastic current allows to receive power parameters of the main condition of process of calibration by sinking and can be used for the solution of a task on stability of process of deformation by results of comparison of power (power) parameters for the main (steady) and indignant states. Modeling is made in cylindrical system of coordinates by comparison of options of kinematic possible fields of the speeds of a current meeting a condition of incompressibility and kinematic regional conditions. The result of the modeling was selected discontinuous field of high-speed, in which the decrease outer radius (R) occurs only by increasing the thickness of the pipe wall (t). For this option the size of pressure of sinking had the smallest value, therefore the chosen field of speeds closely to the valid. It is established that with increase in a step of giving 1 at calibration by the multisector tool the demanded pressure of sinking of q decreases. At an identical step of giving 1 pipe with the smaller relative thickness of (t/r) needs to be calibrated the smaller pressure of sinking. With increase of a limit of fluidity at shift of material of pipe preparation pressure of sinking of (q) increases...|$|E
