Her wooden wheel was salvaged and put on display in the main office of the Finnish Maritime Administration, and the wooden paneling and furniture of the salon was bought by the Finnish yacht club Suomalainen Pursiseura for their club restaurant in Sirpalesaari, Helsinki. In addition the bow propeller shaft of Sampo serves the Finnish winter navigation to this day as part of a sea mark on a small skerry southeast from the island of Utö.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} British newspaper The Daily Telegraph Rhys discussed the song {{in the context of}} parent record Rings Around the World. The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when people talk <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> the world they're really talking <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> humans.

[...] expands on this idea with Rhys stating that the song is about the extinction of the human race: [...] "maybe we'll all die but the world'll still be here, even if it's a dark, singed piece of rock flying around the sun".

500|$|From the outset, Planescape: Torments {{designers}} {{intended to}} challenge traditional role-playing game conventions: the game features no dragons, elves, goblins, or other common fantasy races; {{there are only}} three swords; the rats faced in the game can be quite challenging to defeat; and the undead sometimes prove more sympathetic than humans. The designers explained that most RPGs tend to have a [...] "correct" [...] approach to solving problems, which is almost always the morally good approach. They called this [...] "predictable and stupid" [...] and wished to make a game with greater moral flexibility, where a particular problem might have [...] "two wrongs or two rights".

Death (of the protagonist or his companions) is often just a minor hindrance, and even necessary at times.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the major}} shifts of season four was mixed. [...] "With the new crew in place House takes on a {{slightly}} more energized feel", wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk.

[...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie's comic genius". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: [...] "the cast just kept getting bigger, the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will". USA Todays Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: [...] "Talk <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> the best for last.

500|$|Massengale argues that, {{given that}} music is so {{important}} in the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, {{it is remarkable that}} all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman would have done it so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing exactly the kind of ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle was}} tactically inconclusive, {{although}} Lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first {{from the battlefield}} and retreated back to Virginia. McClellan wired to Washington, [...] "Our victory was complete. The enemy is driven back into Virginia." [...] Yet there was obvious disappointment that McClellan had not crushed Lee, who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to the Potomac River. Although McClellan's subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays (such as Ambrose Burnside's misadventures at Burnside Bridge) and blunders (Edwin V. Sumner's attack without reconnaissance), these were localized problems from which the full army could have recovered. As with the decisive battles in the Seven Days, McClellan's headquarters were {{too far to the}} rear to allow his personal control over the battle. He made no use of his cavalry forces for reconnaissance. He did not share his overall battle plans with his corps commanders, which prevented them from using initiative outside of their sectors. And he was far too willing to accept cautious advice <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> his reserves, such as when a significant breakthrough {{in the center of the}} Confederate line could have been exploited, but Fitz John Porter is said to have told McClellan, [...] "Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E
500|$|With Atkinson thus occupied, an {{alternative}} arrangement {{to pick up}} Scott was necessary. Disregarding Meares, who was [...] "not available for work", the most qualified person available to meet Scott's party was the physicist Wright, an experienced traveller and navigator, but the chief scientist Simpson insisted Wright's scientific work be given priority. Atkinson therefore chose Cherry-Garrard, who could however not navigate, had never handled a dog before and who was moreover short-sighted. Lt Evans wrote later that he thought Scott would have approved the decision to keep Wright at the base camp, whereas Wright later stated [...] "It always worries me - I should have had that job". Cherry-Garrard would be accompanied by Dimitri. In his 1922 book The Worst Journey, Cherry-Garrard recalled the controversial verbal orders given by Atkinson. He was to travel to One Ton Depot as fast as possible, where he was to leave food for the returning polar party. If Scott had not arrived before him, Cherry-Garrard should decide [...] "what to do". Atkinson also emphasised {{that this was not}} a rescue party, and added that Scott had given instructions that the dogs were [...] "not to be risked in view of the sledging plans for next season". In the standard edition of his book, Cherry omitted any mention of Scott's request to be picked up at 82° or 82°30' on 1 March. But after Atkinson's and Lady Scott's deaths in 1929 and 1947 respectively, in a postscript to his privately published 1948 edition, Cherry acknowledged the existence of Scott's order and provided reasons why Atkinson, and later he himself, failed to comply: Cherry-Garrard in 1948 stated that Atkinson was too exhausted at the beginning of February to set off to meet Scott, and that the lack of dog food at One Ton Depot made a timely start impractical. Karen May of the Scott Polar Research Institute goes further by suggesting that the instruction <b>about</b> <b>saving</b> the dogs for the following season was Atkinson's own invention.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} Burns's {{literary}} {{influence in the}} US {{is seen in the}} choice by novelist John Steinbeck of the title of his 1937 novel, Of Mice and Men, taken from a line in the second-to-last stanza of [...] "To a Mouse": [...] "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men/ Gang aft agley." [...] Burns's influence on American vernacular poets such as James Whitcomb Riley and Frank Lebby Stanton has been acknowledged by their biographers. When asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration, singer songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burns's 1794 song [...] "A Red, Red Rose" [...] as the lyric that had the biggest effect on his life. The author J. D. Salinger used protagonist Holden Caulfield's misinterpretation of Burns's poem [...] "Comin' Through the Rye" [...] as his title and a main interpretation of Caulfield's grasping to his childhood in his 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye.
