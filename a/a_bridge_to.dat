5|$|In Ship Harbour {{citizens}} were isolated for 5 days until a temporary road was made. Also in Spaniard's Bay, the flooding caused <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> depress about 1.5feet (50cm); a temporary bridge was built within two months, {{with a permanent}} replacement scheduled to be finished {{by the summer of}} 2008. Insured damage across the area totaled $25million (2007CAD, $24.3million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such flash flood caused <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. The {{good news was}} that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{production}} received a fine (between $343–$3,440) from the Bulgarian {{environmental protection agency}} for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets {{to be built in}} the area (including <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave.|$|E

5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing {{all of his}} novels and stories into a single sequence called La Comédie humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category– including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832)– it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the realism of the Études des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.|$|E
5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E

5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> cross the Rift.|$|E
5|$|Balon Greyjoy {{speaks to}} Yara about their {{war against the}} North. Yara {{points out that the}} armies of the North have retaken all of the Ironborn strongholds on the mainland, and pleads with him to end the war. However, Balon refuses and vows to send more troops to stage another {{invasion}} of the North. As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E
5|$|In February 1926 William Matheson {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with D. P. Davis (a land developer, not related to Waters Davis) to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including all {{of what is now}} Crandon Park and about half the present Village of Key Biscayne. Davis had experience with turning submerged or partially submerged land into prime real estate, having created the Davis Islands in Tampa and Davis Shores near St. Augustine. Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in its boundaries. There were dreams of <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, talk {{started on the}} {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> cross the Mississippi River at Greenville. In 1936, a group called the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that time) worked with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed into law in August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938, and construction started on the bridge a few months later.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road is {{the only}} land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, {{connecting}} to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.|$|E

Another theory suggests that the name is a contraction of [...] "town of bridges", due to {{the large number of}} streams the High Street originally crossed.|$|R
5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want to}} prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body {{in a desperate attempt to}} try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, on 18 November, the {{regiment}} {{moved into a}} line of observation posts along the River Auja.

Dismounting and approaching on foot, they had one man wounded, who was later taken prisoner. The following day {{the regiment}} was relieved by the other rest of the brigade, {{and moved to the}} rear, returning to the front line on 21 November.|$|E

5|$|Until 1928, the Indian River Inlet was {{a natural}} {{waterway}} that shifted {{up and down a}} two-mile (3.2km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place. With the inlet in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> span it, and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia in February 1944, following {{a short period}} in staff positions Graham spent {{the remainder of the}} war in the South-West Pacific. Seconded to the infantry, in December 1944 he was given command of a company from the 24th Battalion and went on to distinguish himself during the Bougainville campaign in 1945. During an action on the morning of 17 April C Company, under Graham's command, encountered heavy resistance in thick jungle while attacking strong Japanese positions around Andersons Junction, astride Dawe Creek. Personally leading the attack, he placed a number of anti-tank guns to cover a river crossing and following heavy fighting the Australians finally secured a foothold by late in the afternoon which allowed <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> be erected across the creek for the tanks to move forward in support. After repelling a Japanese counter-attack overnight, the following morning Graham led his company forward and succeeded in seizing the high ground after another day of bitter fighting that resulted in heavy Japanese casualties. He was immediately awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his leadership. Graham was later wounded amid heavy fighting in difficult terrain as the Australian advance continued along the Buin Road in May. Promoted temporary major in October 1945, he finished the war posted to the 2/4th Armoured Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
