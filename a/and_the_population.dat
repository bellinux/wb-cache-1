5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of Quorn hoped {{that it would}} go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

Some survivors scattered to the nearby Muskogean and Escamacu chiefdoms, while others fled to the provinces of the Guale, Apalachee, and Timucua in Spanish Florida.

5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike lost interest in it.

5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries.

5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} reservoirs reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village.

Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904.

5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
