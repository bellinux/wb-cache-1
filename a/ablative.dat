5|$|Nominal {{morphology}} {{is significantly}} less complex {{than that of}} the verb. There are a number of case suffixes, denoting ergative, absolutive, dative, allative, locative, <b>ablative,</b> semblative, temporal, instrumental and so on.|$|E
5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New <b>ablative</b> insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, <b>ablative,</b> instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, <b>ablative,</b> or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

50|$|The {{language}} uses clitics and particles {{to express}} a variety of things, including possessives, cases, affixes, ideas, locatives, instrumentals, simulatives, <b>ablatives,</b> and demonstratives.|$|R
5|$|The {{language}} distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) {{and eight}} cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, <b>ablative</b> and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, {{as well as}} for case.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking <b>ablative</b> case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), <b>ablative</b> (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E
50|$|Directional prefixes, {{stems and}} suffixes also index spatial {{relations}} in Kaska narratives. These include allatives, <b>ablatives,</b> areals and punctuals, with some examples listed below.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ablatives</b> EAD (24:9) eā, SED (13:5, 14:8) sē, COVENTIONID (22:6) cōntiōne, MAGISTRATVD magistrātū (12:3), OQVOLTOD (15:3) occultō, POPLICOD publicō (15:10), PREIVATOD prīvātō (16:1), SENTENTIAD (8:9, 17:7, 21:8) sententiā.|$|R
50|$|Note: Where {{two forms}} are given, {{the second is}} {{enclitic}} and an alternative form. <b>Ablatives</b> in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -tas; thus mat or mattas, asmat or asmattas.|$|R
5|$|The post-flight {{analysis}} {{reported no}} major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— {{and all the}} engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed. The fuel-conservation measures {{were found to have}} worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full credit for this to the pilot. The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness, and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure. Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed {{that there had been a}} very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft, and the six <b>ablative</b> materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.|$|E
5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental <b>ablative</b> materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
25|$|Treatments can be {{classified}} as either physically <b>ablative,</b> or topical agents. Physically <b>ablative</b> therapies are considered more effective at initial wart removal, but like all therapies have significant recurrence rates.|$|E
25|$|The accusatives, the <b>ablatives</b> and imitatives {{underwent}} optional final vowel deletion, {{while the}} ergatives optionally transformed the final u to a or œ, or deleted it, thus ngathu > ngatha > ngathœ > ngath.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in carbon phenolic <b>ablatives</b> for solid rocket motor nozzles have yielded a pitch precursor carbon fiber offering significant raw material availability and cost saving advantages {{as compared to}} conventional rayon precursor material. This paper discusses {{the results of an}} experimental program conducted to assess the thermal performance and characterize the thermal properties of pitch precursor carbon phenolic <b>ablatives.</b> The end result of this program is the complete thermal characterization of pitch fabric, pitch mat, hybrid pitch/rayon fabric and pitch mat molding compound. With these properties determined an analytic capability now exists for predicting the thermal performance of these materials in rocket nozzle liner applications. Further planned efforts to verify material performance and analytical prediction procedures through actual rocket motor firings are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Reentry heat shields {{on these}} {{vehicles}} are often proposed {{to be some}} sort of ceramic and/or carbon-carbon heat shields, or occasionally metallic heat shields (possibly using water cooling or some sort of relatively exotic rare earth metal.) [...] Some shields would be single-use <b>ablatives,</b> discarded after reentry.|$|R
25|$|Genitive – kilmininkas; it also {{functions}} {{similarly to}} the <b>ablative</b> case in other languages.|$|E
25|$|When used {{outside the}} CNS {{it may be}} called {{stereotactic}} body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic <b>ablative</b> radiotherapy (SABR).|$|E
25|$|In {{all other}} cases {{adjectives}} are formed with the <b>ablative</b> {{case from the}} genitive, {{as is the case}} with nouns.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{economics of}} the solid rocket booster for the Space Shuttle. Costs have been held down by adapting existing technology to the 146 in. SRB selected, with NASA reducing the cost of expendables and reusing the expensive nonexpendable hardware. Drop tests of Titan III motor cases and nozzles proved that boosters can survive water impact at vertical velocities of 100 ft/sec so that SRB components can be reused. The cost of expendables was minimized by selecting proven propellants, insulation, and nozzle <b>ablatives</b> of known costs; the propellant has the lowest available cost formulation, and low cost <b>ablatives,</b> such as pitch carbon fibers, will be used when available. Thus, the use of proven technology and low cost expendables will make the SRB an economical booster for the Space Shuttle...|$|R
40|$|A {{handbook}} {{compilation of}} chemical and physical property tests data obtained during qualification and receiving inspection testing of nonmetallic materials for the Viking Lander is introduced. Data cover the following materials: sealants, potting compounds, lubricants, paints and finishes, inks, films, encapsulants, elastomers, structural plastics, <b>ablatives,</b> adhesives, and electrical and thermal insulation. Thermochemical data showing degradation {{as a function of}} temperature, from room to 500 C, are included...|$|R
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} status of Thermal Protection System (TPS) Ablator technologies and the preparation for use in interplanetary spacecraft. NASA does not have adequate TPS <b>ablatives</b> and sufficient selection for planned missions. It includes a comparison of shuttle and interplanetary TPS requirements, {{the status of}} mainline TPS charring ablator materials, a summary of JSC SBIR accomplishments in developing advanced charring ablators {{and the benefits of}} SBIR Ablator/fabrication technology...|$|R
25|$|In a {{positive}} comparison, the object takes the <b>ablative</b> case; the adverb daha ("more") is optional, unless {{the object is}} left out.|$|E
25|$|Just as in {{the disappearing}} dative case, colloquial Latin {{sometimes}} replaced the disappearing genitive case with the preposition de followed by the <b>ablative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Physically <b>ablative</b> {{methods are}} more likely to be {{effective}} on keratinized warts. They are also most appropriate for patients with fewer numbers of relatively smaller warts.|$|E
25|$|Sanskrit pronouns are {{declined}} for case, number, and gender. Many pronouns have alternative enclitic forms. The {{first and}} second person pronouns are declined {{for the most part}} alike, having by analogy assimilated themselves with one another. <b>Ablatives</b> in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -tas; thus mat or mattas, asmat or asmattas. Sanskrit does not have true third person pronouns, but its demonstratives fulfil this function instead by standing independently without a modified substantive.|$|R
50|$|The proofs {{of human}} {{habitation}} {{dating back to}} the Bronze Age have been found in a direct vicinity of the town - mostly period pieces of Lusatian culture. In the pre-Christian era, on the highest hill within present borders of the town - Klimont hill, place of worship dedicated to Slavic god Perun, (modern <b>ablatives</b> Piorun, Pieron - meaning Thunderbolt) was located. Much later, in 1769, Saint Clement Church was raised in exactly the same spot, where pagan place of worship used to be.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} low cost large solid rocket motors {{developed}} at the Lewis Research Center is given. An estimate is made of the total cost reduction obtainable by incorporating this new technology package into the rocket motor design. The propellant, case material, insulation, nozzle <b>ablatives,</b> and thrust vector control are discussed. The effect of the new technology on motor cost is calculated for a typical expandable 260 -in. booster application. Included in the cost analysis is the influence of motor performance variations due to specific impulse and weight changes. It is found for this application that motor costs may be reduced by up to 30 % and that the economic attractiveness of future large solid rocket motors will be improved when the new technology is implemented...|$|R
25|$|Nouns and {{adjectives}} were {{declined in}} (at least) six cases: vocative, nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, genitive. The locative case had merged into the dative case, and the <b>ablative</b> may have merged {{with either the}} genitive, dative or instrumental cases. However, sparse remnants of the earlier locative and <b>ablative</b> cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms. Pronouns were declined similarly, although without a separate vocative form. The instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular; the instrumental survives only in the West Germanic languages, and the vocative only in Gothic.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{has less}} {{evidence to suggest}} its use. It may be less effective than other <b>ablative</b> methods. It is extremely expensive, and often used as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|While the {{instrumental}} {{case is the}} form most commonly used for this purpose, when coupled with the passive voice in Armenian {{the instrumental}} case can be replaced with the <b>ablative</b> case.|$|E
40|$|As a {{collaborative}} effort among NASA Centers, the "Lightweight Nonmetallic Thermal Protection Materials Technology" Project {{was set up to}} assist mission/vehicle design trade studies, to support risk reduction in thermal protection system (TPS) material selections, to facilitate vehicle mass optimization, and to aid development of human-rated TPS qualification and certification plans. Missions performing aerocapture, aerobraking, or direct aeroentry rely on advanced heatshields that allow reductions in spacecraft mass by minimizing propellant requirements. Information will be presented on candidate materials for such reentry approaches and on screening tests conducted (material property and space environmental effects tests) to evaluate viable candidates. Seventeen materials, in three classes (<b>ablatives,</b> tiles, and ceramic matrix composites), were studied. In additional to physical, mechanical, and thermal property tests, high heat flux laser tests and simulated-reentry oxidation tests were performed. Space environmental effects testing, which included exposures to electrons, atomic oxygen, and hypervelocity impacts, was also conducted...|$|R
25|$|Most Western European {{languages}} {{have greatly}} reduced levels of inflection, particularly noun declension. In contrast, Icelandic retains a four-case synthetic grammar comparable to German, though considerably more conservative and synthetic. Because Icelandic {{is in the}} Germanic family, which as a whole reduced the Indo-European case system, it is inappropriate to compare the grammar of Icelandic {{to that of the}} more conservative Baltic and Slavic languages of the Indo-European family, many of which retain six or more cases. Icelandic is distinguished by a wide assortment of irregular declensions. Icelandic also has many instances of oblique cases without any governing word, much like Latin. For example, many of the various Latin <b>ablatives</b> have a corresponding Icelandic dative. The conservatism of the Icelandic language and its resultant near-isomorphism to Old Norse (which is equivalently termed Old Icelandic by linguists) means that modern Icelanders can easily read the Eddas, sagas, and other classic Old Norse literary works created in the tenth through thirteenth centuries.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a variety}} of {{injectors}} for liquid oxygen (LOX) and methane (CH 4) propellant systems have been designed, fabricated, and demonstrated with hot-fire testing at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Successful designs for liquid methane (LCH 4) and gaseous methane (GCH 4) have been developed. A variety of chambers, including a transpiration cooled design, along with uncooled <b>ablatives</b> and refractory metals, have also been hot-fire tested by MSFC for use with LOX/LCH 4 injectors. Hot-fire testing has also demonstrated multiple ignition source options. Heat flux data for selected injectors has been gathered by testing with a calorimeter chamber. High performance and stable combustion have been demonstrated, along with designs for thrust levels ranging from 500 to 7, 000 lbf. The newest LOX/CH 4 injector and chamber developed by MSFC have been fabricated with additive manufacturing techniques and include unique design features to investigate regenerative cooling with methane. This low cost and versatile hardware offers a design for 4, 000 lbf thrust and will be hot-fire tested at MSFC in 2015. Its design and operation can easily be scaled for use in systems with thrust levels up to 25, 000 lbf...|$|R
