Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed.

5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia, and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E

25|$|An <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker's</b> reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|R

40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} refugee crisis in Europe, {{the realities of}} <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policy {{outcomes}} are in the media almost every day, as is debate about {{what works and what}} does not. Policy directions in this space can have profound effects on those seeking help from the state. This thesis critiques contemporary <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policy using Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition as a basis for analysis. Honneth’s theory challenges the contemporary securitisation of <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policy and suggests that justice based approaches alone are not sufficient in this space. Using Honneth’s theory, the thesis imagines <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policy positions that are more hospitable, generous and caring compared to the status quo, without discounting the need for appropriate security for citizens. As Honneth and his concept of recognition sit within the school of critical theory, the thesis incorporates a Gesellschaftskritik methodology, an approach that identifies societal behaviours that are damaging or morally questionable and offers alternatives that, it is hoped, will improve society. The critique focuses on three case studies of contemporary <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policy: the United States of America, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. These case studies were chosen because their <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> policies show traits consistent with securitisation. Moreover, all three countries have the political stability, infrastructure and wealth to be more hospitable if the political will existed. Thesis (M. Phil.)
