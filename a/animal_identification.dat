40|$|Abstract- microRNAs (miRNAs) are 20 - 22 nt noncoding RNAs {{which are}} rapidly {{emerging}} as crucial regulators of gene expression in plants and <b>animals.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the hairpins which yield mature miRNAs {{is the first}} and most challenging step in miRNA gene prediction.

DIANA-microH implements a Support Vector Machine classifier trained on a set of structural and evolutionary features characteristic of miRNA hairpins. DIANA-microH introduces a unique structural feature motivated by a consideration of how enzymatic cleavage occurs. On test data, the SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 98. 6 %.

Although recognized as a potential biomarker in vertebrates, it has not been well studied in aquatic <b>animals.</b> <b>Identification</b> of ODC is a prerequisite for its application as a selective breeding marker in small abalone, Haliotis diversicolor. In this article, we focused on the in vitro characterization of the ODC gene from small abalone. The expressed product showed decarboxylase activity for l-ornithine and was inhibited by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine hydrochloride hydrate. ODC was expressed in a wide range of tissues at varying levels, with the lowest in the hepatopancreas and the highest in the antennae. ODC is potentially useful as a molecular marker for small abalone breeding and can also facilitate further investigations on its biological functions in mollusks.

MethodsThis {{study was designed}} using three primers that could simultaneously identify and differentiate two major species of pathogenic Brucella in humans and <b>animals.</b> <b>Identification</b> and differentiation of each species using {{the size of the}} PCR product were determined. To determine the specificity of the method, bacteria close to the genus Brucella were used. Finally, to confirm PCR products, In addition to the products sequence, RFLP was performed on PCR products using restriction enzymes. ResultsThe method of optimized combinatorial PCR in this study could simultaneously detect and differentiate B. abortus and B. melitensis with high specificity and sensitivity in clinical samples. Differentiation of species is based on the resulting bands; therefore, the band 494 bp for B. abortus and 733 bp for B. melitensis were obtained. RFLP and sequencing results confirmed PCR results. ConclusionsThe results of this study shows that without routine diagnostic methods such as culture and serology tests, using the molecular method of combinatorial PCR, important species of Brucella can be simultaneously identified and differentiated in clinical samples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The natural {{cycle of}} Bartonella bacilliformis remains uncertain, and the {{suspected}} existence of animal reservoirs for the bacterium {{has never been}} convincingly demonstrated. We conducted a survey of Bartonella species infecting intradomicillary animals in a bartonellosis-endemic region of Peru, obtaining blood from 50 animals living {{in the homes of}} 11 families whose children had recently had bartonellosis. Bartonella-like bacteria were recovered from four of nine small rodents included in the study, but from none of the 41 domesticated <b>animals.</b> <b>Identification</b> and comparison of these isolates, and two Bartonella-like isolates obtained from Phyllotis mice in a different endemic region of Peru using serologic and genotypic methods indicated that although none were strains of B. bacilliformis, five were probably representatives of three previously unrecognized Bartonella species and one was a likely strain of the pathogenic species B. elizabethae. Although records of human bartonellosis predate Colum-bus, the epidemiology of the disease and the natural cycle of its etiologic agent Bartonella bacilliformis remain virtu-ally unknown.

Filarial {{nematode}} parasites are {{a serious}} cause of morbidity in humans and <b>animals.</b> <b>Identification</b> of filarial infection using traditional morphologic criteria {{can be difficult}} and lead to misdiagnosis. We report on a poly-merase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) –based method to detect and differen-tiate {{a broad range of}} filarial species in a single PCR. The first internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) along with the flanking 18 S and 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were isolated and cloned from Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia pahangi. Sequence analysis identified conserved sites in the 18 S and 5. 8 S rDNA sequence that could be used as universal priming sites to generate ITS 1 -distinctive PCR products that were useful for distinguishing filariae at the genus level. The addition of a digestion of the ITS 1 PCR product with the restriction endonuclease Ase I generated a fragment profile that allowed differentiation down to the species level for W. bancrofti, B. malayi, B. pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis, and D. repens. The PCR-RFLP of ITS 1 rDNA will be useful in diagnosing and differentiating filarial parasites in human, animal reservoir hosts, and mosquito vectors in disease-endemic areas...|$|R
