After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E

Of these detenidos-desaparecidos 157 were murdered after being released from detention.
