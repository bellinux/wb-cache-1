25|$|Koniecpolski had to lay several {{possible}} ambushes, as Khan Temir was <b>a</b> <b>savvy</b> tactician, {{and would not}} fall easily into a trap. Eventually, he tricked the Tatars into attacking his lines, and after some feints by both sides, he managed to trick them into attacking a fortified tabor formation. In order to entrap Khan Temir, Koniecpolski created the illusion that his forces were retreating, abandoning high ground and leaving some scattered wagons with supplies, suggesting disorder. The Tatar attack was absorbed by the Polish cavalry, and a bloody battle ensued, which after about an hour caused the Tatars to break off. Koniecpolski's then pursued them, before withdrawing again, this time luring Tatars into the artillery fire of the tabor formation. This {{was followed by the}} charge of all 12 chorągiews of Polish cavalry. In the ensuing retreat, many Tatars drowned in the Dniestr river or nearby muds, and Khan Temir was wounded. Polish forces pursued the fleeing Tatars, and were able to free most of the people the Tatars had captured and were leading into slavery (jasyr). The Polish pursuit ended on the night of 20 to 21 June.|$|E

500|$|Classical Voice North America Paul E. Robinson {{said the}} album's {{contents}} were unrelated to its title, and had [...] "nothing whatever {{to do with}} {{the early days of the}} American West", but complimented the orchestra's performances. He praised the [...] "excellent" [...] flute soloist in The Incredible Flutist, called the performance of Copland's symphony [...] "more careful than inspired", and noted the [...] "vast dynamic range" [...] created by the label's sound technology. Peter Dickinson of Gramophone compared Kalmar's interpretation of Symphony No. 3 to other available recordings: [...] "Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony are impressive and create a challenge to the established choices. Kalmar is a minute shorter than Bernstein in both the opening movement and fanfare finale. Overall his interpretation is similar to Bernstein's, and the orchestra's expert handling of the work suggests that they should record more." [...] Furthermore, he wrote, [...] "Engineering is excellent but individual tracks for the Piston would have been a help." [...] Anthony Tommasini, music critic for The New York Times, called the recording [...] "exciting" [...] and said the Piston piece received a [...] "supple, colorful performance". He complimented [...] "A Jazz Symphony", which he said [...] "emerges here as <b>a</b> <b>savvy,</b> audacious score", and ended his review with: [...] "Best of all is an urgent, superbly played account of Copland's Third Symphony." [...] The Oregonian David Stabler praised the Oregon Symphony for recording the lesser-known works by Piston and Antheil.|$|E

500|$|Hallie Rubenhold's 2005 book The Covent Garden Ladies {{sets out}} her {{interpretation}} of the story behind Harris's List. [...] She claims that John Harrison—otherwise known as Jack Harris, <b>a</b> <b>savvy</b> businessman and pimp {{who worked at the}} Shakespear's Head Tavern in Covent Garden—was the list's originator. [...] Born perhaps around 1720–1730, Harris apparently had expert knowledge of prostitutes working in Covent Garden and beyond, as well as access to rented rooms and premises for his clients' use. [...] He kept a record of the women he pimped and the properties he had access to, possibly {{in the form of a}} small ledger or notebook. [...] Derrick, having previously authored The Memoirs of the Shakespear's Head, and possibly also its companion piece, The Memoirs of the Bedford Coffee House, was probably familiar with the Shakespear's Head. [...] The former book details [...] "Jack, a waiter... who presides over the Venereal Pleasures of this Dome", and its author likely studied Harris as he went about his business. [...] Which of the two men first thought to produce Harris's List is unknown, but probably for a one-off payment Harris allowed his name to be attached to it. [...] With his detailed knowledge of Covent Garden, and with help from various associates, Derrick was therefore able to write the first edition of Harris's List in 1757. [...] As an aspiring author and social climber he preferred not to associate himself publicly with such questionable material, and his name therefore does not appear on any editions.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} first film, {{merchandising}} accompanied Gremlins 2. This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>savvy,</b> off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, yes, it {{is just one more}} silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film." [...] One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.|$|E

[...] In 1916, Lake County became the first county in eastern Oregon to issue bonds for highway construction. [...] When the bonds failed to sell as expected, Daly bought the remaining bonds himself.

2500|$|In early April 2014, standup comedian turned actor Ashvin Mathew {{announced}} {{through his}} social networking pages {{that he has}} been cast in a small comic role. In the same time, producers Sandra Thomas and Vijay Babu announced that since they are travelling with the crew to the U. S. for the filming, they also appear in the film as a cost-cutting measure. Babu plays Sunny Kurishingal, initially they approached a number of actor who fit the [...] "requisites of <b>a</b> <b>savvy</b> Indian-American". But none of them was ready to afford the length filming schedule in the United States. Hence Babu himself took the part. Taiwanese-American actor John Wusah was cast as Dup Lee after attending an audition in the United States for the role. Shankar Ramakrishnan's role as an American Senator was confirmed in early June 2014. Aneesh G. Menon was confirmed in July 2014, as playing a politician in the film. Vineeth Mohan got his first talking role with this film as Kunjappan's car driver.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{believed}} {{strongly in}} composing and playing by ear (quote: [...] "You give a better performance if you skip the eyes"). He composed not on paper, but [...] "on his band" [...] — by humming phrases to his sidemen, or by demonstrating riffs and rhythms {{on the keyboard}} and instructing players to interpret his cues. It was all done by ear, with no written scores (a process known as [...] "head arrangements"). Scott, who was also <b>a</b> <b>savvy</b> sound engineer, recorded the band's rehearsals on discs and used the recordings as references to develop his compositions. He reworked, resequenced, or deleted passages, or added themes from other discs to construct finished works. During the developmental process, he let his players improvise, but once complete, he regarded a piece as relatively fixed and permitted relatively little further improvisation. This practice alienated some jazz purists and critics. Scott rigidly controlled the band's repertoire and style, but he rarely took piano solos, preferring to direct the band from the keyboard and leaving solos and leads to his sidemen. He also had a penchant for adapting classical motifs in his compositions. This annoyed some serious music authorities, who dismissed such practices as [...] "trivializing the classics." [...] The public, who bought his records by the millions, seemed indifferent to any controversy.|$|E
