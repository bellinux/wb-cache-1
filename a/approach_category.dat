40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the high cycle fatigue behaviour of metals in the case of multiaxial loading where the stresses are of different frequencies. In particular, combined axial load and torsion fatigue tests were performed on specimens made of quenched and tempered steel. This material has been chosen because it is commonly employed for the production of mechanical components intensively stressed under lengthy fatigue loads. Two frequency ratios between the shear stress and the normal stress are examined and the resulting fatigue limits from these tests are compared to the results from tests where the shear and normal stress are of the same frequency and inphase. Moreover, different multiaxial fatigue limit criteria, based on the critical plane concept and on the so-called integral approach, are used to analyse the obtained experimental results. In general, better agreement between predictions and experimental results is achieved by the criteria of the integral <b>approach</b> <b>category...</b>|$|E
30|$|Since the {{image-based}} {{approach is}} the core of this paper, then it will be discussed. Image-based approaches can be categorized, based on the classification strategy used in the design process, into two subcategories: appearance-based approach and boosting-based approach [8]. Appearance-based <b>approach</b> <b>category</b> is considered as any image-based approach face detector that does not employ the boosting classification methods in it classification stage. However, other classification schemes are used such as neural networks [9, 10], Support Vector Machines (SVM) [11], Bayesian classifiers [12, 13], and so forth. All techniques in the appearance-based approach lack the ability to perform in real-time, and it takes an order of seconds to process an image [8]. The other image-based approach subcategory is the boosting-based approach, this approach started after the successful work of Viola and Jones [3] where high detection rate and high speed of processing (15 frames/second) using the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm [14] and cascade of classifiers were used. Boosting-based approach is considered as any image-based approach that uses the boosting algorithm in the classification stage.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} two generative probabilistic {{models for}} category-level object recognition. Both schemes {{are designed to}} learn categories {{with a minimum of}} supervision, requiring only a set of images known to contain the target category from a similar viewpoint. In both methods, learning is translation and scale-invariant; does not require alignment or correspondence between the training images, and is robust to clutter and occlusion. The schemes are also robust to heavy contamination of the training set with unrelated images, enabling them to learn directly from the output of Internet Image Search engines. In the first <b>approach,</b> <b>category</b> models are probabilistic constellations of parts, and their parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. The appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position, relative scale and probability of detection are explicitly represented. Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder identifies promising locations for the model’s parts. Second, the category model is used to compare the likelihood that the observed features are generated by the category model, or are generated by background clutter.

40|$|The {{description}} of an archaeological entity {{is a process}} that often begins with the classification of the entity into one of a set of available categories; once the category is known, the description process itself may begin. This approach, albeit powerful and intuitive, is prone to causing category bias, since the category system at use has probably been created under the influence of ontic, epistemic and pragmatic conditions that are different to those of the current situation. Category bias, in turn, produces alterations in the information being generated that are very difficult to correct and, sometimes, even to detect. In this work we propose a category-less approach to th e {{description of}} archaeological entities that avoids classification as an a priori mechanism, using instead the entity’s properties as units of description.

While the earliest category V areas were designated mainly for their landscape and recreational values, they are increasingly expected also to protect biodiversity. Critics have claimed that they fail to conserve enough biodiversity. The current paper addresses this question by reviewing available evidence for the effectiveness of category V in protecting wild biodiversity by drawing on published information {{and a set of}} case studies. Research to date focuses more frequently on changes in vegetation cover than on species, and results are limited and contradictory, suggesting variously that category V protected areas are better than, worse than or the same as more strictly protected categories in terms of conserving biodiversity. This may indicate that differences are not dramatic, or that effectiveness depends on many factors. The need for greater research in this area is highlighted. Research gaps include: (i) comparative studies of conservation success inside and outside category V protected areas; (ii) the contribution that small, strictly protected areas make to the conservation success of surrounding, less strictly protected areas—and vice versa; (iii) the effectiveness of different governance approaches in category V; (iv) a clearer understanding of the impacts of zoning in a protected area; and (v) better understanding of how to implement landscape approaches in and around category V protected areas...|$|E

40|$|Continued {{research}} in electronic engineering technology {{has led to}} a miniaturisation of integrated circuits. Further reduction in the dimensions of the interconnects is impeded by the presence of small cracks or voids. Subject to high current and elastic stress, voids tend to drift and change shape in the interconnect, leading to a potential mechanical failure of the system. This thesis investigates the temporal evolution of voids moving along conductors, in the presence of surface diffusion, electric loading and elastic stress. We simulate a bulk-interface coupled system, with a moving interface governed by a fourth-order geometric evolution equation and a bulk where the electric potential and the displacement field are computed. We first give a general overview about geometric evolution equations, which define the motion of a hypersurface by prescribing its normal velocity in terms of geometric quantities. We briefly describe the three main approaches that have been proposed in the literature to solve numerically this class of equations, namely parametric approach, level set approach and phase field approach. We then present in detail two methods from the parametric <b>approach</b> <b>category</b> for the void electro-stress migration problem. We first introduce an unfitted method, where bulk and interface grids are totally independent, i. e. no topological compatibility between the two grids has to be enforced over time. We then discuss a fitted method, where the interface grid is at all times part of the boundary of the bulk grid. A detailed analysis, in terms of existence and uniqueness of the finite element solutions, experimental order of convergence (when the exact solution to the free boundary problem is known) and coupling operations (e. g., smoothing/remeshing of the grids, intersection between elements of the two grids), is carried out for both approaches. Several numerical simulations, both two- and three-dimensional, are performed in order to test the accuracy of the methods. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Category theory {{had been}} formalized in Mizar quite early [6]. This {{had been done}} closely to the {{handbook}} of S. McLane [10]. In this paper we use a different <b>approach.</b> <b>Category</b> is a triple 〈O,{〈o 1,o 2 〉} o 1,o 2 ∈O,{◦o 1,o 2,o 3 } o 1,o 2,o 3 ∈O 〉 where ◦o 1,o 2,o 3 : 〈o 2,o 3 〉 × 〈o 1,o 2 〉 → 〈o 1,o 3 〉 that satisfies usual conditions (associativity {{and the existence of}} the identities). This approach is closer {{to the way in which}} categories are presented in homological algebra (e. g. [1], pp. 58 - 59). We do not assume that 〈o 1,o 2 〉’s are mutually disjoint. If f is simultaneously a morphism from o 1 to o 2 and o ′ 1 to o 2 (o 1 � = o ′ 1) than different compositions are used (◦o 1,o 2,o 3 or ◦o ′ 1,o 2,o 3) to compose it with a morphism g from o 2 to o 3. The operation g · f has actually six arguments (two visible and four hidden: three objects and the category). We introduce some simple properties of categories. Perhaps more than necessary. It is partially caused by the formalization. The functional categories are characterized by the following properties: • quasi-functional that means that morphisms are functions (rather meaningless, if it stands alone) • semi-functional that means that the composition of morphism is the composition of functions, provided they are functions. • pseudo-functional that means that the composition of morphisms is the composition of functions. For categories pseudo-functional is just quasi-functional and semi-functional, but we work in a bit more general setting. Similarly the concept of a discrete category is split into two: • quasi-discrete that means that 〈o 1,o 2 〉 is empty for o 1 � = o 2 and • pseudo-discrete that means that 〈o,o 〉 is trivial, i. e. consists of the identity only, in a category. We plan to follow Semadeni-Wiweger book [13], in the development the category theory in Mizar. However, the beginning is not very close to [13], because of the approach adopted and because we work in Tarski-Grothendieck set theory...|$|E
