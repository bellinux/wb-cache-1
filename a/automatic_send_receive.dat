40|$|Algorithms for vector {{timestamps}} {{have been}} developed to determine the “happened before” relations between events of an execution of a message passing program. Many message passing programs contain variables shared by multiple processes (including threads). Such programs need to have vector timestamps for <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write events. We define two “happened-before” relations, called strong happened-before (SHB) and weak happened-before (WHB), between events of an execution involving <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write statements. We then present two timestamp assignment algorithms, one for SHB and the other for WHB, and show how to use such timestamps to determine the SHB or WHB relation between any two events of an execution involving <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write statements. For a program containing n processes, the size of a vector timestamp for SHB or WHB is n, regardless of the number of shared variables in the program. Finally, we show how to apply WHB timestamps to perform race analysis for programs using messages and shared variable...|$|R

40|$|In Wireless Ad hoc Network nodes {{are forming}} the {{temporary}} connection establishment in between sender and receiver through intermediate nodes. The nodes are uses the limited power or energy for routing packets or performing any {{function in the}} network. Due to that the energy efficient routing is the significant issue in Wireless Ad hoc Network. In dynamic network the connection lost and re-establishment consumes more energy in routing. In this paper we proposed a new energy efficient Ad hoc On Demand location based routing protocol (EAODV-DREAM) for improving the routing performance and energy utilization in Wireless Ad hoc Network. The only Energy based AODV (EAODV) routing protocol {{are not able to}} handle the connection stability in dynamic network. The proposed routing technique is utilizes the battery power consumption and also the node energy are utilized for data <b>sending,</b> <b>receiving</b> and forwarding. The location DREAM protocol is playing a vital role for maintaining the location of mobile nodes with the mobility speed. The DREAM has minimizes the control overhead in network and due to that the energy of mobile nodes are also utilizes for data <b>sending</b> and <b>receiving.</b> The TCP connection analysis of <b>sending</b> <b>receiving</b> and drop in between sender and receiver is shows the EAODV is <b>send</b> and <b>receive</b> less number of packet and also drop is more but the proposed routing is improves with greater energy utilization...|$|R
