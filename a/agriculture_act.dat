2500|$|Under the First Wilson Government, {{subsidies}} for farmers were increased. Farmers {{who wished to}} leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous [...] "disturbance compensation." [...] A Hill Land Improvement Scheme, introduced by the <b>Agriculture</b> <b>Act</b> of 1967, provided 50% grants {{for a wide range}} of land improvements, along with a supplementary 10% grant on drainage works benefitting hill land. The <b>Agriculture</b> <b>Act</b> 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate outgoers.|$|E

Nowadays, milk quotas no longer exist, but other subsidies (largely rolled up into Single Payments) still need to be divided between the parties.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Agriculture</b> <b>Act</b> 1947 broadly revamped {{agricultural}} law. [...] It was {{a reaction}} to the privations of the Second World War, and was aimed at food security, so as {{to reduce the risk of}} a hostile foreign power being able to starve the UK into submission. [...] The Act guaranteed prices, markets and tenure, so that a farmer could be assured that his land would not be taken away and whatever he grew would be sold at a known price. [...] Yet another consolidating Agricultural Holdings Act followed it in 1948. [...] These Acts made it harder to evict tenant farmers. [...] With the new security tenants enjoyed, a system of rent reviews was necessary to take account of land price inflation. [...] There were many other changes in the law, and each of these Acts needed negotiations between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to fix the support price to be paid for each agricultural product. [...] They were enacted in a series of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts in 1949, 1954, 1963, 1968 and 1972.|$|E
