5|$|Lambert's {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay himself as <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> – {{as in the}} novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own unsteady mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|E

At age 16, Nani was training on alternate days with Sporting CP and Benfica. Nani sometimes walked miles to and from practice before Sporting offered him pre-season training. Despite growing up in Lisbon, Nani and his brother supported FC Porto as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his footballing hero was Luís Figo.|$|E

5|$|The plot of {{the film}} was best convened through a {{published}} synopsis in trade which introduced {{the names of the}} cast and the backstory. Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple, marry and have two children, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> a girl. The parents have been unemployed, but the film starts with the parents finding work in an upcoming production at a theater. As they return home, they are interrupted by the landlady, Mrs. O'Brien, who demands the rent. The landlady does not car about the family's misfortune and is upset when she cannot collect. She provides one week for the Temple family to pay up.|$|E
5|$|The reformers' {{propaganda}} {{claimed that}} England had been unified {{as a result}} of the wide acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> was very close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore follows <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his pet dog {{as they are}} {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both {{the boy and his}} shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world that is composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E

5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} {{a church}} {{dedicated}} to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> a girl sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom {{to pick up a}} stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, the church would rebuild itself. A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the {{transport}} ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; {{if he was not}} Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The Claimant hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. However, a former sweetheart of Orton's, Mary Ann Loder, did identify the Claimant as Orton.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first composition is located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds a model of the church, and a child, of which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays a man, a woman, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> a girl, with the man also holding a model of the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third composition is in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E

5|$|Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney {{developed}} an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> {{got a job}} as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|Having {{trained with}} Walsall's Centre of Excellence as <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> then played local {{football}} for Tividale, Davis began a scholarship in Wolverhampton Wanderers' youth academy in 2007.

He spent time on loan at three other clubs in the lower leagues– Walsall and Chesterfield of League One and League Two Shrewsbury Town– {{as well as at}} Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle, before making seven appearances for Wolves in the Premier League {{at the end of the}} 2011–12 season during their unsuccessful fight against relegation. Although playing fairly regularly in the Championship, he never established himself as a consistent member of the starting eleven as Wolves were again relegated. He fell out of favour the following season, and left for West Midlands neighbours Birmingham City in August 2014.|$|E
