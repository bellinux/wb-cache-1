500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesnâ€™t." ...|$|E
60|$|Her wicked {{little white}} teeth flashed ominously <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cleopatra {{looked all}} round the table <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> and {{appeared}} very uneasy.|$|E
6000|$|The mother {{held up the}} letter, {{addressed}} to Master Felix Chester Underwood, No. 8 St. Oswald's Buildings, Bexley, and smiled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'Is <b>it</b> all right, my boy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} remembered even now how {{extraordinarily}} CLEAR--he couldn't call it anything else--she had looked, in her prettiness, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it.</b> He also remembered {{what he had}} been moved to reply. [...] "The happiest reigns, we are taught, you know, are the reigns without any history." ...|$|R
60|$|He became solicitous for her. How had she got {{on while}} he was away? She asked him how one was likely to get on at Buryhamstreet; monoplanes didn't fall every day, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> {{occurred}} to her she was behaving meanly. But he was going on to his next topic before she could qualify.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mine indeed!' cried Miggs, with a {{burst of}} bitterness--and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> she glanced towards Dolly. 'MINE, good gentleman!' ...|$|E
60|$|Her colour rose <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> {{modestly}} and hurriedly. Louisa {{understood the}} loving pretence, {{and her heart}} smote her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or {{with one}} who does--not--love him." [...] This she said very slowly, very softly, but looking {{up into his}} eyes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'No thank you,' said Gudrun. And <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{her heart}} sank horribly. The sick man seemed {{to fall into}} a gap of death, at her contradiction. She ought to play up to him, not to {{contravene}} him. In an instant she was smiling her rather roguish smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall, my dear," [...] {{said the}} doctor at once; and she seemed {{grateful}} not to be opposed, speaking more gently, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "May <b>it</b> be now--while there is no daylight?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Eva {{looked up}} with some anxiety in her frank eyes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Now <b>it</b> is my turn. Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to Ruskin, Kant, or Plato?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{says he has}} James More my father's errand," [...] said she. She was whiter than ever, and {{her voice}} faltered <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Never again." [...] I think Mrs. Fursey took a {{pleasure}} in the phrase. It sounded, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{like something out of}} the prayer-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, love?" [...] she said. And Bessie {{could never}} have divined the gnawing anxiety that was eating at her heart <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Duty be--hanged! I'm {{going to}} see you safe home, if you'll let me. Here's your hat. I dried it; but it don't look quite shipshape somehow." [...] And taking the shabby little object from the nail where it hung, he {{presented}} it with such respectful care that a glimmer of the old mirthfulness came into Letty's face, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> surveying <b>it</b> with much disfavor,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|While Marjorie spoke, {{the lady}} had been adding more {{color to the}} sketch, and when she looked up, {{something}} warmer and brighter than sunshine shone in her face, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> so cheerily, <b>it</b> was like a bird's song to hear her,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{listened in}} a fright to the latch of the door, {{and the coming}} in. Betsey's voice came up, through every chink of the boards, {{whatever}} she did herself; and he could hear every word of her greeting, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> how <b>it</b> was such a fine day, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to Mother <b>she</b> would take a holiday, and come and see Cousin King and the poor lad: it must be mighty dull for him, moped up there.|$|R
60|$|She {{watched him}} keenly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{but there was}} not the {{slightest}} sign in his expressive face, {{to show that he}} had recognised the name.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{with her}} eyes upon the fire-glow, there was an {{instantaneous}} escape of distress into her face. Bella seized the moment to touch her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} her." [...] And then, in a moment, {{with a sudden}} soft smile--"E bella!" [...] said the little girl. She was {{beautiful}} herself <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|The road out of Tafelberg wound upward among {{tall trees}} toward the pass {{that would lead}} him across the next valley {{on his way to}} the Old Forest, where he hoped to find some {{excellent}} shooting. All his life Barney had promised himself that some day he should visit his mother's native land, and now that he was here he found it as wild and beautiful <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be.|$|R
6000|$|Meta's eyes glistened with tears, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Perhaps <b>it</b> {{would have}} been too perfect if he had come; but oh, Norman! how good she is to bear it so patiently! And how gloriously he behaved! How can we make enough of him! And Flora out! how sorry she will be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{not touch}} her!' cried Frank, forgetting {{that he could}} not be understood, and raising her in his arms, as the chair was withdrawn; but she did not speak or move, and there was a {{distressing}} throng and confusion of strange voices, seeming to hem them in as Constance looked round, unable to call up a single word of German, or to understand the exclamations. Then, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> always <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> was like an angel's voice that said, 'What is it?' as through the crowd came a tall lady in a white hat and black gown, and knelt down by the prostrate figure, saying, 'I hope she is only stunned; let us carry her in. It will be better to let her come round there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She never {{displays}} mercy. She loves {{no one but}} herself," [...] asserted Lady Aurex, but she trembled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> as if afraid even yet of her terrible Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're more to {{be relied}} upon than silver and gold.' <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> Miss Wren {{suddenly}} broke off, screwed up her eyes and her chin, and looked prodigiously knowing. 'Aha! ...|$|E
60|$|She felt humbled {{and ashamed}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{but there was}} nothing else to do. In spite of her feelings, in spite of the cost, she must have the letter.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Henry {{decided that}} he would first take a bath and then dress himself in a blue satin suit that had caught his fancy. He {{accepted}} his good fortune with calm composure and refused to have a servant to assist him. But Aunt Em was [...] "all of a flutter," [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>it</b> took Dorothy and Jellia Jamb, the housekeeper, and two maids a long time to dress her and do up her hair and get her [...] "rigged like a popinjay," [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> quaintly expressed it. She wanted to stop and admire everything that caught her eye, and she sighed continually and declared that such finery was too good for an old country woman, and that she never thought she would have to [...] "put on airs" [...] at her time of life.|$|R
6000|$|Then she crept slowly {{out of the}} room, {{and very}} slowly and very silently {{made her way to}} the parlour-door. Though she was of a strong nature, unusually strong of heart and fixed of purpose, now her heart misgave her. That terrible struggle, with all its {{incidents}} of weariness and agony, was present to her mind. Her mother could not turn the lock on her now; but, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> would be very dreadful. Her mother would say words to her which would go through her like swords. Then she opened the door, and for a moment there was the sweetness of an embrace. There was a prolonged tenderness in the kiss which, even to Mrs. Bolton, had a charm for the moment to soften her spirit. 'Oh, mamma; my own mamma!' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, Hill {{recorded}} {{a song for}} the Pearl Harbor soundtrack which was originally offered to Celine Dion. It {{is one of her}} most critically acclaimed songs. Besides, <b>as</b> how <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> in her own words, [...] "One of the biggest honor of my career is being asked to sing a theme from Pearl Harbor." [...] "There You'll Be" [...] also appeared on the album , an international greatest hits album. The album featured dance mixes of [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] along with alternate versions of [...] "Piece of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Let Me Let Go." [...] "There You'll Be" [...] is considered to be Hill's biggest hit single in the UK up to date. The song was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.|$|R
60|$|Evan {{does not}} know to this day what {{particular}} question he asked, but he vividly remembers that she answered, and every line or fluctuation of her face <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodbye," [...] said Norah, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> {{and put out}} {{her hand}} there were tears brimming up into her eyes. But Mr. Spillikins, being short of sight, didn't see them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{women of}} Helium {{are taught to}} frown with displeasure upon the tongue of the flatterer," [...] rejoined the girl, but Gahan, Jed of Gathol, {{observed}} that she smiled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{give her}} a makeover, recreating Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] video. Guidance {{counsellor}} Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrasted with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims <b>she</b> did <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> and <b>it</b> was no big deal.|$|R
50|$|Why Mary Abaza is {{a unique}} female vocalist? It's because she has got a unique voice of great compass from contralto (overrides male baritone) to soprano (they say, with this rare and {{uncommon}} voice, one can be admitted to the Moscow Conservatory without entrance examinations) and withal she is a brilliant growler and added to everything else, {{she is one of}} the first female growling vocalists in the world {2}. She got jazz and some classical educations and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> herself, <b>it</b> helped her to find her own way of singing death metal applying some jazz tricks; by the way it helps her in creating music. When Mary began singing death metal she was crazy about John Tardy (Obituary) as a vocalist and imitated something from his hysterical manner. Then she added to her voice some black metal high tones and worked on timbre and articulation {3}.|$|R
