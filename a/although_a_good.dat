25|$|Although other {{editions of}} the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, {{it was not until}} the edition of 1721, {{published}} under the auspices of Sir Hans Sloane, that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> number were still retained, such as dogs’ excrement, earthworms, and moss from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, cordials and ratafias were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on {{his fourth}} tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946-47, 1950–51 and 1954-55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and {{enthusiastic}} wicketkeeping was a joy to watch and considered {{by far the best}} in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958-59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing {{down at the end of}} their careers.|$|E

2500|$|An all-metal, {{stressed-skin}} wing of duraluminium (a DERD specification {{similar to}} AA2024) {{was introduced in}} April 1939 and was used {{for all of the}} later marks. [...] "The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was [...] higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, L1877, was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath." [...] Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair. Changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|A risky {{decision}} of Barnum's established {{him as a}} legitimate impresario. During his Tom Thumb tour of England, Barnum had {{become aware of the}} popularity of Jenny Lind, the [...] "Swedish Nightingale". Lind's career was at its height in Europe. She was unpretentious, shy and devout, and possessed a crystal-clear soprano voice projected with a wistful quality and earnestness that audiences found touching. Barnum had never heard her and conceded to being unmusical himself. He approached her to sing in America at $1,000 a night for 150 nights, all expenses paid by him. He knew that his risk was great, noting: [...] "'The public' is a very strange animal, and <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> knowledge of human nature will generally lead a caterer of amusement to hit the people right, they are fickle and ofttimes perverse." [...] But Barnum was confident that her reputation for morality and philanthropy could be turned to good use in his publicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{line and}} station were opened by the Maryport and Carlisle Railway {{primarily}} to access collieries in the Bolton Coalfield and {{to head off}} rival attempts to access this potential traffic by the North British Railway-backed Silloth Company.

2500|$|George {{was born}} in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, to Robert King and Cecilia Anderson. Robert King was a {{bookseller}} who moved to Aberdeen to partner with his brothers who were also in the book business. One brother Arthur was {{the founder of the}} Aberdeen University Press. Another brother George was an antiquarian, founder of a local liberal newspaper and a prominent writer on economic and social matters. King's parents both died from phthisis, the father in November 1845 aged thirty six and the mother in 1850 at the age of forty. Orphaned at the age of ten, George was taken care of by his namesake uncle. After studying at the Aberdeen Grammar School where he was nicknamed [...] "Tertius" [...] to distinguish him from other [...] "King" [...] namesakes, something that stuck. One of his teachers was Patrick Geddes. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> student, his health was poor and was forced to leave in 1854. The family had associated with the Free church but King later favoured the Anglican church. For a while he worked with his uncle's press business but continued to take a greater interest in natural history that had developed in his youth. He started putting together a collection in his work place, something the printer uncle despised. At the age of eighteen King decided to pursue a medical education and entered the University of Aberdeen in 1861, where he was influenced by his teachers George Dickie, Alexander Harvey and John Struthers.|$|E
