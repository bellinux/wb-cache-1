50|$|During the 1980s, {{the large}} {{increase}} in drug trafficking greatly challenged the police. Unfortunately, some personnel proved vulnerable to corruption by traffickers, and {{public confidence in}} the police suffered from charges of official collusion in the drug trade. Public perceptions of the police also suffered from charges that police sometimes resorted to unnecessary force in their efforts to deal with escalating violent crime. During the late 1980s, police leadership began to focus on both problems, expressing a willingness to pursue every <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> and to rid the police of unworthy personnel. Penalties for official violators of criminal statutes also increased. The success of these efforts was unclear by mid-1991.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} and explains the first Canadian medical malpractice crisis. While malpractice had {{emerged as a}} prominent legal issue in the United States by the mid nineteenth century, Canadian doctors first began to express concerns with a growth in malpractice litigation {{in the late nineteenth}} century. Physicians claimed that lawsuits damaged reputations and forced them to spend lavishly on defending themselves. Doctors blamed lawyers for drumming up spurious lawsuits and argued that ignorant or malicious jurors tended to side with plaintiffs. Evidence, however, points to additional factors that contributed to litigation. Medical professionals in rural areas sometimes avoided lengthy travel, leading to <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> when patient health declined despite calls for attendance. As the number of doctors increased in Canada, some physicians may have encouraged negligence suits against their competitors. Late nineteenth-century claims to professionalism also played a role. Patients came to expect better outcomes, especially in orthopedics, which dominated most of the reported instances <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> in the period...|$|R

500|$|Since Athenian {{politicians}} were often indicted by their opponents, {{there was not}} always {{a clear distinction between}} [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative perspective on defensive medicine. Defensive medicine is usually understood as {{arising from the}} effect of law on medicine through fear of litigation. Of equal significance, however, is the complementary influence of medicine on law through technological innovation, and, more importantly, the way that medicine and law develop dialectically. Each shapes the other in establishing the standards of care central to both clinical medicine and to actual or potential legal action. Excessive testing owing to fear of litigation indicates that defensive medicine is being practised in a particular setting, {{but it does not}} explain why this is so. To understand why defensive medicine occurs and why it is so troubling to clinicians requires an understanding, not only of medical and legal developments, but of a political-economic system and the beliefs and values of a society. Defensive medicine is discussed in relation to hospital obstetrical scenarios commonly associated with fear of litigation: fetal oxygen deprivation ("distress"), which is detected using an electronic fetal monitor, and prolonged labor, known as "dystocia". The material presented is taken from a medical anthropological study of obstetrical care in rural British Columbia, Canada. Litigation fears are shown to result less from rare, albeit often devastating, <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> than from doctors adopting a role as "fetal champions", together with the introduction of electronic monitoring technology. The paper concludes by asserting that, rather than being in an adversarial relationship, medical practice and associated litigation primarily work together to reinforce each other, and the social conditions in which defensive medicine occurs.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} attitudes, values and {{perceptions}} of early years practitioners, to question what factors cause them to remain in day nurseries when research indicates a general undervaluing of practitioner needs (Cameron, Owen, Moss 2001). The study sits within the broader context of retention {{at a time when}} practitioners are constantly affected by change in the sector. The passion of practitioners in the research is evident, so too is the exploitation of it. The importance of the investigation lies in recognising that raising the quality of provision through qualifications pays no regard to the emotional needs of early years practitioners. If, as this study suggests, some practitioners are stressed at work, this has the potential to affect colleagues and children. If the only time we pay heed is when <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> surface, we will have to wait for more children and practitioners to suffer before anything is done to address the situation. The wellbeing of early years practitioners has been brought into question through this investigation. I suggest that the absence of professional wellbeing negates any attempt to recruit or retain early years practitioners to work in day nurseries. Those of us who are concerned with the welfare and education of children should focus for a moment on the welfare of practitioners who provide their education and care. Those who are able must be proactive in offering funded creative opportunities for reflective practice with the aims of assuring practitioners that we value them and care enough to help safeguard their wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Increased {{attention}} {{has recently been}} focused on health record systems {{as a result of}} accreditation programs, a growing emphasis on patient safety, and the increase in lawsuits involving <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice.</b> Health-care professionals frequently express dissatisfaction with the health record systems and complain that the data included are neither informative nor useful for clinical decision making. This article reviews the main objectives of a hospital health record system, with emphasis on its roles in communication and exchange among clinicians, patient safety, and continuity of care, and asks whether current systems have responded to the recent changes in the Italian health-care system. Discussion If health records are to meet the expectations of all health professionals, the overall information need must be carefully analyzed, a common data set must be created, and essential specialist contributions must be defined. Working with health-care professionals, the hospital management should define how clinical information is to be displayed and organized, identify a functionally optimal layout, define the characteristics of ongoing patient assessment in terms of who will be responsible for these activities and how often they will be performed. Internet technology can facilitate data retrieval and meet the general requirements of a paper-based health record system, but it must also ensure focus on clinical information, business continuity, integrity, security, and privacy. Conclusions The current health records system needs to be thoroughly revised to increase its accessibility, streamline the work of health-care professionals who consult it, and render it more useful for clinical decision making—a challenging task that will require the active involvement of the many professional classes involved. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{split in}} the republican {{movement}} was completed at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis on 10-11 January at the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge, Dublin, when the proposal to drop abstention was put before the members. The policy of abandoning abstentionism had to be passed by a two-thirds majority to change the party's constitution. Again, there were <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> and that pro-Goulding supporters cast votes they were not entitled to. In addition, the leadership had also refused delegate status (voting rights) {{to a number of}} Sinn Féin cumainn (branches), particularly in the north and in County Kerry, where they knew them to be opposed. The motion was debated all of the second day, and when it was put to a vote at 5.30 p.m. the result was 153:104 in favour of the motion but failing to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority. The leadership then attempted to propose a motion in support of the (pro-Goulding) IRA Army Council, led by Tomás Mac Giolla. This motion would only have required a simple majority. As the (pro Goulding) IRA Army Council had already resolved to drop abstentionism, this was seen by the minority group (led by MacStiofain and Ó Brádaigh) as an attempt to subvert the party's constitution. They refused to vote and withdrew from the meeting. Anticipating this move by the leadership, they had already booked a hall in 44 Parnell Square, where they established a [...] "caretaker executive" [...] of Sinn Féin. The Caretaker Executive declared itself opposed to the ending of abstentionism, the drift towards [...] "extreme forms of socialism", the failure of the leadership to defend the nationalist people of Belfast during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, and the expulsion of traditional republicans by the leadership during the 1960s.|$|R
