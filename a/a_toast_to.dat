Kalākaua was also feted at a gala in San Francisco's Chinatown, given by the Chinese Consul-General and attended by leaders of the local Chinese community. It was Armstrong who delivered the after-dinner speech and offered <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> continued {{good relations with the}} Chinese population in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|After {{a quarrel}} with Barkis, and realizing {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness {{the same way it}} was stolen from her. She stops Victor from drinking the poison and reunites him with Victoria. Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed {{to be the one who}} murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> Emily, unknowingly drinking the cup of poison. The dead, able to intercede upon Barkis's death, eagerly take retribution against him by dragging him to the underworld where he will atone for his crimes. Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He considered that Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> Saavedra, as if he was the king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, Saavedra signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but Saavedra considered that it was a disproportionated response to a trivial issue.|$|E

5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He asked them to join his party in <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> their health, in the hope that a full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase {{was later}} popularized by {{a song of}} the same name in Stephen Sondheims 1970 musical Company. The {{character}} Joanne, played by Elaine Stritch, a rich, cynical, middle-aged woman, makes <b>a</b> drunken <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> her peer group in The Ladies Who Lunch. The lyrics offer <b>a</b> sardonic <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> rich women, including herself, who fill their time with frivolous things like luncheons and parties. The song has given the phrase [...] "ladies who lunch" [...] a negative connotation. Joannes condemnation of women who are [...] "off to the gym, then to a fitting, claiming theyre fat" [...] does not paint these women in a generous light. Ladies who lunch are often seen as lacking substance.|$|R

25|$|In April 1831, the {{officers}} were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous, and Galois proposed <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> King Louis Philippe with a dagger above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life. He was arrested the following day but was acquitted on 15 June 1831.|$|E
25|$|Three hundred persons then enjoyed luncheon {{served in}} a marquee in the next-door field, {{alongside}} the road. There were many speeches, including a long one from the Earl: this time discussing church and laity, flattering the clergy and mentioning the Irish Church Bill. A number of toasts were given, drunk and responded to at length. A toast was made to the architects and Barber responded, concluding the speeches with <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> the ladies.|$|E

At his Palace in Sofia, Prince Ferdinand gave <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> President Roosevelt in English, and a band played American music, but the U.S. {{still did not}} fully recognize Bulgaria as an independent nation, since it was still by treaty a principality under Ottoman sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|The Scots Greys, {{along with}} certain other regiments of the British Army, handled the loyal toast differently. Since the Glorious Revolution, {{officers}} {{were required to}} toast {{the health of the}} reigning sovereign. Typically, this meant standing and giving <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> the monarch. The Scots Greys, however, did not stand for the toast. It is said that this tradition of giving the loyal toast while seated started during the reign of George III. During his reign, George III would often dine with the regiment; however, because of his health, he was unable to stand during the toasts. Since he could not, he allowed the officers to remain seated during the loyal toasts.|$|E
25|$|The society {{continued}} well {{through the}} twentieth century, although the First World War hit it badly, with 136 {{of its former}} members killed. Eoin O'Mahony was elected Auditor in 1930 and faced impeachment when he raised <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> Ireland instead of the King. Interestingly, Eoin O'Mahony offered Lord Carson the Presidency of the Society in 1931, although Carson declined due to ill health, recommending that the position be offered to former Gold Medallist and future President of Ireland Douglas Hyde, who {{was elected to the}} position. The current President is Prof. David McConnell, a former Librarian and Auditor of the Society and a winner of The Irish Times Debating Competition, and now Chairman of The Irish Times Trust and one of Europe's foremost geneticists.|$|E
25|$|The bar {{is packed}} with students, artists and flower girls, singing and dancing. Magda enters and attracts the {{attention}} of several young men. She hurries over to a table at which Ruggero is sitting alone. She apologizes for intruding and tells him that she will move away {{as soon as the}} young men at the bar stop watching her. Ruggero, who does not recognize Magda in her disguise, asks her to stay. They chat and Ruggero tells Magda that she reminds him of the quiet and elegant girls from his home town, Montauban. They dance happily together. Prunier and Lisette enter, arguing about Prunier's desire to turn Lisette into a lady and to educate her. Magda and Ruggero return to their table and Magda begins to reminisce about a past love affair. Ruggero asks for her name and she answers 'Pauletta'. She writes the name on the tablecloth and Ruggero adds his own beneath. The attraction between Magda and Ruggero grows as they talk. Lisette and Prunier pass their table and Lisette recognizes Magda. Magda signals to Prunier not to give away her secret and Prunier tells Lisette she is mistaken. To prove his point, he introduces Lisette to Magda, who tries to maintain her disguise, to the puzzlement of Lisette. The two couples sit together and drink <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> love. Prunier notices that Rambaldo has come in, and orders Lisette to take Ruggero out of the room for a few minutes, which she does. Rambaldo demands an explanation from Magda for her behaviour and disguise; she tells him that she has nothing to add to what he has already seen. Rambaldo suggests they leave together but she refuses and declares her love for Ruggero, apologizing for any pain she is causing Rambaldo by her actions. Rambaldo tells her that he cannot prevent her staying with Ruggero. As he leaves, Ruggero returns, and tells Magda that dawn is breaking. They decide to begin a new life together, but Magda secretly worries that she is deceiving Ruggero.|$|E

500|$|Prime Minister Ian Smith {{attended}} the RLI's Annual Regimental Sundowner on 1 February 1968, commemorating {{the founding of}} the Battalion seven years earlier.

The toast was widely publicised by the Rhodesian press and had such impact that [...] "The Incredibles" [...] became a second nickname of the RLI alongside [...] "The Saints". Captain F. Sutton, who had three years earlier composed the Battalion's slow march, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, renamed the march The Incredibles.|$|E

Angela, annoyed that Pam does not relinquish the name, makes <b>a</b> <b>toast</b> <b>to</b> [...] "my son Phillip" [...] {{at the garden}} party—only to have Pam make the same toast but describe in great detail how the name honors her grandfather. Angela, unwilling to reveal her feline-centric reasons for the name, grouses to the camera that Pam is always copying her.|$|E
5000|$|In many cultures, {{toasting}} {{is common}} {{and to not}} do so may be a breach of etiquette. The general theme of the common brief toast is [...] "good luck" [...] or [...] "good health".
