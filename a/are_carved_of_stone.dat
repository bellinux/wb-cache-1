50|$|Rygge church (Rygge kirke) is {{a medieval}} era church {{located in the}} village of Kirkegrenda. The church belongs to Vestre Borgesyssel deanery in Diocese of Borg. Rygge church is one of the county's better {{preserved}} medieval stone churches. It is built around the year 1170. Rygge church was originally a chapter church, which had income from a larger area than a parish and contained several villages. The building is characterized by the use <b>of</b> large <b>stones,</b> partly <b>of</b> granite, but parts <b>of</b> the facade <b>is</b> <b>carved</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> cultivar, including large parts of the north portal.

A figurine of a scarab would <b>be</b> <b>carved</b> out <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> {{and then on the}} smooth stomach of the scarab, the engraving of a seal was made. Later, this oval image was used for the representation of the cartouche, or name/title seals.|$|R

So a wooden tablet was quickly made, and the mayor of Beijing wrote the three characters [...] "中華門" [...] (Gate of China).|$|R

Most people rely on the railway link to commute to Mumbai for work. Like all Mumbai suburbs Ambarnath is divided into Ambarnath East and Ambarnath West by the railway. Ambarnath west is in an industrial zone and is home to hundreds of small and large chemical factories. An Ordnance Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board has been established by the Government of India {{which is one of the}} reasons for Ambarnath developing into a residential neighbourhood. A large manufacturing facility of WIMCO, India's largest manufacturer of safety matchsticks, is also located in Ambarnath on the Kalyan-Badlapur Road. Ambarnath is also famous for its Shiva temple, which is located in Ambarnath East.|$|R

50|$|The {{images are}} {{scratched}} a few milimetres into the <b>stone.</b> On account <b>of</b> the low relief, many images {{are difficult to}} make out. Only Cup and ring marks have a depth of multiple centimetres. In brittle granite and gneiss, the edges are always broken, but {{the reason for this}} is not clear. As a rule it is not possible to determine whether images have been reworked at a later time. Most will have been made using an un-modified stone as a tool with which to scratch or pick out the image. Quartz may have been favoured for this. This is certainly true for the flat images, in which the image <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>stone,</b> appearing as a silhouette in the rock face. Only rarely do such images contain internal divisions. This technique is mainly found in eastern Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|The chancel is Early English Period, but {{the main}} {{structure}} is in the Late Perpendicular Gothic style, dating from about the reign of Henry VII, and rebuilt in 1620. It was restored {{under the direction of}} Sir George Gilbert Scott when new oak roofs were added, and the old carving, retained wherever possible, or faithfully reproduced. It consists of chancel, nave, aisles, south porch and a western tower of Perpendicular era, containing four bells. There are several stained windows, a pulpit <b>of</b> <b>carved</b> alabaster around which runs an elaborate railing of metal work, in which a combination of copper, brass and tin has been used, the whole resting on a stone base.

50|$|The castle {{has a very}} Austrian style {{architecture}} {{which can}} be explained by the fact that the castle was erected after a devastating fire in 1750 which burnt most of the existing castle to ruins. The architect was Albert Starck from Austria who during the Austrian reign of this part of Europe built several important buildings (today national monuments) in this area such as the rectory of Bovingy. The castle itself is built in 1.5-meter thick schist stone walls. The wings were added in the early 19th century and served as farmhouses. The farm was reachable from the outside leaving all privacy to the castle. The interior floors are built in schist stone and the style is Louis XV. The main entrance to the castle <b>is</b> <b>carved</b> out <b>of</b> Recht <b>stone</b> and contains the escutcheon of the Beurthé. The farms also contain a wood oven dating back to the 16th century. The oven is still in regular use today. On the top of the tower, one can see elephant shaped flags bearing the family escutcheons and building date. All buildings on this site are protected as national monuments.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} an important historical building: the Saint James Theater {{in the city of}} Corfù (Greece) actually used as the Municipality House. The building, located {{in the center of the}} city, <b>is</b> made <b>of</b> <b>carves</b> <b>stones</b> and <b>is</b> characterized by a stocky shape and by the presence of wooden floors. The study deals with the structural identification of such structure through the analysis of its ambient vibrations recorded by means of accelerometers with high accuracy. A full dynamic testing was developed using ambient vibrations to identify the main modal parameters and to make a non-destructive characterization of this building. The results of these dynamic tests are compared with the modal analysis of a complex finite element (FE) simulation of the structure. This analysis may present several problems and uncertainties for this stocky building. Due to the presence of wooden floors, the local modes can be highly excited and, as a consequence, the evaluation of the structural modal parameters presents some difficulties. This work was supported in part by the European Territorial Cooperation Programme “Greece-Italy 2007 - 2013 ”, under grants of the project Structural Monitoring of ARTistic and historical BUILding Testimonies (S.

The church was consecrated on Thursday 13 November 1890 by Bishop Walsham How. The font was originally in the south-west corner (now moved to centre) and <b>is</b> <b>carved</b> out <b>of</b> Caen <b>stone,</b> with St Jude's symbol of a fishing boat; there is a similar symbol carved in the organ arch. The font has the original carved wooden cover which once featured a dove finial. However, much of the remaining interior has been redesigned since 1889, giving it a different appearance. For example, it had gas lighting, which was replaced with electric lighting in 1904. There was originally an organ by Abbott and Smith of Leeds, and this was renovated between 1932 and 1974. In spite {{of these and other}} interior changes, the English Heritage description says: [...] "It is a large suburban church retaining its late C19 character, in a prominent position on the edge of Savile Park, where it makes an important contribution to the historical integrity of the local townscape.

The lyrics seems to be a semi-concept album as it is meant to be a journey and each song represents part of that journey. A lot of the lyrics were inspired by books and poems such as Despair by Vladimir Nabokov and The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost.
