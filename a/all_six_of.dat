5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new and enjoyable game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy. Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages, but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative. <b>All</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E
5|$|The novel won {{most of the}} British book awards {{that were}} judged by {{children}} and other awards in the US. The book {{reached the top of}} the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least seventy three other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> its sequels.|$|E

5|$|The two {{starting}} quarterbacks {{combined for}} 31 incomplete passes, with the clock stopping on each incompletion, and the officials called 19 penalties, leading to more clock stoppages. Each team used <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> its allocated timeouts, {{and the many}} scores led to additional commercial breaks. At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed {{the fact that the}} game seemed to be running longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because Māori players were not able to go to South Africa at the time, meaning the Australians, played against a New Zealand team made up of the best Māori and the reserve non-Māori players, while the South Africans {{encountered}} the best pākehā (non-Māori) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 11–6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 16–9, which gave Australia a Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an annus horribilis for the All Blacks as they lost <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> their test matches, and the experience of playing two test series simultaneously has not been repeated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not {{selected}} for Australian duty. He came in at No. 4 after the dismissal of his brother. Ray was selected for <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist and Australia {{started their}} 2007 World Cup {{campaign}} by winning {{all three of}} their matches in Group A, against Scotland, the Netherlands and South Africa. Australia won <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> their matches in the Super8 stage with little difficulty—the margins of victory were exceeded 80 runs or six wickets in every instance. They topped the table and thus qualifying for a semi-final rematch against fourth-placed South Africa. Gilchrist opened the Australian batting in each match, taking a pinch-hitting role in the opening powerplays. Initially successful in the group matches, scoring 46, 57 and 42, he failed in the first Super8 match against West Indies (7), but bounced back to score a second half-century (59 not out) in a ten-wicket victory against Bangladesh in a match drastically shortened due to rain. After a run of middling scores, he failed again in the final Super8 match against New Zealand.|$|E

At the 55th British Academy Film Awards, Gosford Park came away with two awards from nine nominations.

Gosford Park won <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the awards that it was nominated for at the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.|$|E
5|$|Kapena married Kahilipulu on September 2, 1846, in Honolulu, Oʻahu. Kapena {{was also}} {{married to a}} sister of Joshua Kekaulahao. She died before 1858. Kapena led the {{procession}} at the funeral of <b>all</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> her family members including her two brothers, nephew, cousin and father. It is not known if these two pieces of information refer to the same person. Nothing beyond that is known about Kapena's marital status. In the Hawaiian tradition of hānai (a form of informal adoption), he adopted his nephew John Makini Kapena (1843–1887), the only son of Makini and Naʻawa, a relative of King Kalākaua. John Kapena {{went on to become}} an important government minister under the reign of Kalākaua in the 1870s. The younger Kapena also married Emma Aʻalailoa Malo (1846–1886), the only daughter of David Malo, the elder Kapena's Lahainaluna classmate.|$|E
