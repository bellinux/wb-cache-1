40|$|International audienceThe opioid {{system is}} implicated in {{various aspects of}} <b>alcoholism.</b> <b>Acute</b> ethanol {{administration}} produces anxiolytic-like effects in rodents while alcohol withdrawal induces anxiogenic-like effects. Mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) do not self-administer ethanol and display decreased anxiety-like behavior. We hypothesized that MOR might {{be involved in the}} development and expression of alcoholism, particularly in relation to anxiety states. In mice lacking MOR (MOR-/- mice), we examined the acute anxiolytic-like and locomotor stimulant effects of ethanol (0, 0. 75, 1. 25, 1. 75 g/kg, i. p.). In a separate experiment, mice were submitted to chronic ethanol-containing liquid diet and we assessed somatic and affective ethanol withdrawal on three consecutive withdrawal episodes by scoring handling-induced convulsions and anxiety-like behavior. Deletion of MOR blocked the acute anxiolytic-like and stimulant effects of ethanol. Furthermore, MOR-/- mice displayed affective and physical signs of ethanol withdrawal in earlier withdrawal tests than wild-type mice. The present results implicate MOR in affective and somatic aspects of ethanol exposure and withdrawal. In addition, our findings support the hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone against relapse to alcoholism might be related to an action on the acute positive effects of alcohol rather than the negative affect of abstinence...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice of}} using a lower plasma paracetamol (acetaminophen) concentration threshold {{for the treatment of}} paracetamol poisoning in patients with chronic alcoholism has been introduced on the basis of anecdotal case reports. In animals, acute alcohol loading inhibits toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol whilst chronic alcohol administration results in cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 E 1 induction with increased toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol by CYP 2 E 1 and increased hepatotoxicity. However, due to species differences in CYP expression, activity and induction, it is not possible extrapolate the results of these animal studies to clinical situations in humans. Isoenzymes are also responsible for the metabolic activation of paracetamol in humans and human studies to date have not convincingly demonstrated increased toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol in patients with chronic <b>alcoholism.</b> <b>Acute</b> alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose is probably protective and the timing and chronicity of alcohol intake is therefore crucial in the interpretation of the effects of alcohol on paracetamol overdose. One of the problems in the interpretation of the literature to date is that insufficient information is available on the timing of alcohol intake in relation to the ingestion of paracetamol. Whilst it is possible that chronic exposure to excessive amounts of alcohol does predispose patients with paracetamol overdose to hepatotoxicity, a critical review of the literature reveals that the evidence to date does not support this. A prospective, controlled study is required. On the basis of the scientific evidence to date, use of the 100 line for patientswith chronic alcoholism, in countrieswhere the 200 line represents the standard treatment line, is unjustified...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{description}} and analysis of specific instances of child mortality due to witchcraft and motivated by envy, which, {{in the area of}} social knowledge and practices of the Mazahua families, with whom I worked, represents the main cause of death. The study likewise analyses such cases in relation to traditional therapy and biomedicine. 	The Mazahua population of Amerindian origin undergoes conditions of extreme poverty and subsequently reveals high levels of child mortality (more severe than in any other age group). Given that the majority of these deaths are attributed to evil spells, I stress the fact that the most significant social function arise from the interaction of the structural aspects of a socio-economic and politically ideological order, such as the processes of hegemony and subalternity with biomedicine, together with personal emotional aspects inasmuch as envy is the main motivation of witchcraft. 	This variable of envy stems from the consideration of its force and recurrence in these families, as a product of the impoverished conditions, both being the main ingredient of the witchcraft symbolism. We are dealing with an envy which parents perceive in neighbors and family members -known as 'brujos' (witches) for specific reasons-, that is, economic possessions such as land ownership and its products. The mothers, on the other hand, attributed this envy to their husbands' infidelity. The <b>acute</b> problem of <b>alcoholism</b> in male members is closely linked to such conflicts. In this sense, a central function of witchcraft is to enable the parents to cover up the structural causes of the death of their young children. 	With respect to sicknesses defined by biomedicine and suffered by young children dying from witchcraft, these illnesses are mainlyEl trabajo se centra en la descripción y el análisis de casos concretos de muerte infantil por brujería motivada por envidia, que en las representaciones sociales y prácticas de los padres de familia mazahuas con quienes trabajé, es la principal causa de su fallecimiento. De igual forma se analizan estos casos en relación con las terapias tradicionales y de la biomedicina. 	La población mazahua, de origen amerindio, en una gran mayoría, se encuentra en condiciones de extrema miseria, y como consecuencia presentan las tasas más elevadas de muerte infantil (de mayor gravedad que en el resto de grupos etáreos). Dado que gran parte de estas muertes sea adjudican a los maleficios, destaco las funciones sociales más significativas que son producto de la interacción de aspectos estructurales de orden socioeconómico e ideológico político, como son los procesos de hegemonía y subalternidad con la biomedicina, junto con aspectos personales afectivos dado que la envidia es la motivación central de la brujería. 	Esta variable de la envidia parte de considerar su fuerza y recurrencia en estas familias, como producto de sus condiciones de miseria, siendo ambas el principal ingrediente del simbolismo de la brujería. Se trata de una envidia que los padres de familia perciben de sus vecinos y familiares -denominados por ello 'brujos'-, por motivo de sus principales bienes económicos, como son la tenencia de la tierra y sus productos. Y las madres en particular la atribuyen además al adulterio de sus esposos. El grave problema de alcoholismo en los varones se vincula estrechamente con estos conflictos. En este sentido una función central de la brujería es permitir a los padres encubrir las causas estructurales por las que fallecen sus pequeños. 	En cuanto a las enfermedades alópatas que...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{analysis}} of freeway networks entails the quantification of crash frequency influencing factors which include roadway and traffic characteristics, environmental factors {{as well as}} human factors. This quantification {{can be used to}} detect locations with large impacts on the occurrence of crashes which in turn assist engineers and planners to improve safety levels of the network. Roadway characteristics are comprised of the physical elements of the road geometry such as section length, median and right shoulders, speed-exchange lanes, the number of main facility as well as geometry of the entrance from and exit to the main freeway facility. Traffic characteristics are comprised of traffic flow and vehicular volumes while environmental factors include weather conditions, pavement surface conditions, work zone areas conditions, and lighting conditions along the travel facility. Human factors are comprised of aging, aggressiveness while driving, mental stability, fatigue, <b>alcoholism,</b> <b>acute</b> psychological stress, suicidal behavior, drowsiness, and temporary distraction. Variability in the crash frequency is captured by the interaction of the aforementioned factors either in a multiplicative or additive nature through the use of statistical model formulation. When all factors believed to influence the occurrence of crashes are included in a mathematical formulation and all the assumptions underlying the statistical model are met, variability in the crash frequency referred to as observed heterogeneity can be fully explained. However, not all information believed to generate crashes is available. Some of the factors are latent in nature and some are either not available at the time of analysis or require time and high cost to be established. When such conditions exist, a formulated model does not fully explain observed heterogeneity in the crash frequency. Lack of information to fully explain variability in crash frequency as a result of excluding some factors leads to unobserved heterogeneity problems which results in biased and inconsistent safety estimators. Specifically, when observed crash counts are considered as clusters, analytical approach should consider the possibility of dependence within clustered crash counts. Correlation within clusters may be due to variation being induced by common unobserved cluster-specific factors. Ignoring cluster-effects increases the likelihood in drawing conclusion based on unrealistic inferences because safety estimator standard errors are likely to be underestimated and the usual conditional mean is no longer correctly specified. Cross sectional dependence may also arise when the crash counts have a spatial dimension due to contiguous freeway segments. Such conditions lead to what is known as spatial autocorrelation. This is the presence of spatial pattern in crash frequency over space due to geographic proximity whereby high values of crash frequency tend to cluster together in adjacent freeway segments or high crash frequencies are contiguous with low values of crash frequencies. When the distribution of crash frequency over space exhibit the aforementioned pattern, safety analysis techniques based on the distributional assumption of independence of crash frequency is violated. This study has two objectives: First, analyze safety of freeway geometric features while accounting for the effect of unobserved influencing factors and cluster-specific effects; Second, analyze safety of freeway geometric elements in the presence of spatial autocorrelation due to geographical proximity effects. To achieve the first objective, four models are compared: Two are standard Poisson and Negative binomial regression models which do not account for cluster effects. The other two are mixed effects Poisson and Negative binomial regression models which in addition to fixed effects parts they account for the effects of randomness arising from heterogeneity and clustering. The empirical results indicate that 13. 9 % of the variation in crash frequency is unaccounted for, which is an indication of the existence of unobserved factors influencing the occurrence of crashes. It is also revealed that weaving segments (EN-EX) had the highest between segment variance compared to non-weaving segments. More vehicles and short segments increased crash frequency while wider right shoulder decreased the crash frequency. It is also observed that weaving segments decreased crash frequency compared to non-weaving segments. These results indicate that by allowing parameters to vary within the weaving and non-weaving segments it is possible to capture and quantify unobserved factors. Ignoring these factors results in biased coefficients because the estimate of the standard errors required determining inferential statistics will be wrong. To achieve the second objective, Conditional Autoregressive models in Bayesian setting framework (CAR) is used. CAR models recognize the presence of spatial dependence which helps to obtain unbiased estimates of parameters quantifying safety levels since the effects of spatial autocorrelation is accounted for in the modeling process. Based on CAR models, approximately 51 % of crash frequencies across contiguous freeway segments are spatially autocorrelated. The incident rate ratios revealed that wider shoulder and weaving segments decreased crash frequency by factors of 0. 84 and 0. 75 respectively. The marginal impact graphs showed that an increase in longitudinal space for segments with two lanes decreased crash frequency. However, an increase of facility width above three lanes results in more crashes which indicates an increase in traffic flows and driving behavior leading to crashes. These results call an important step of analyzing contagious freeway segments simultaneously to account for the existence of spatial autocorrelation...|$|R
