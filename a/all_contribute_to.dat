It's not only {{hard to believe that}} a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would be followed by a movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E

5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell {{to the bottom of}} a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the geology of this area.|$|E

From the mould, the body is cast in fibreglass, and the head and hands are fitted to the fiberglass body and dressed in clothes that are often donated by the celebrity. The pose, clothes and expression on the face <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> making the figure as realistic as possible. The whole process usually takes {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E

5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|With the {{increasing}} use of plastic, human influence has become an issue as many types of plastics do not biodegrade. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to fish, seabirds, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coasts. Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> this problem.|$|E
25|$|Commercial silks {{originate}} from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred {{to produce a}} white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The pupae are killed by either dipping them in boiling water before the adult moths emerge or by piercing them with a needle. These factors <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{the ability of the}} whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread, permitting a much stronger cloth to be woven from the silk.|$|E

Nicaragua's high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high risk sexual behaviors associated with the culture of machismo, low prevalence of condom usage, and the early age of first sexual intercourse of its citizens <b>all</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> concerns about rising HIV/AIDS rates.|$|E
