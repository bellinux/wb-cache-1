5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> that can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City {{entered the}} match as favourites, {{in a contest}} billed as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> of styles. Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a {{television}} audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through Joe Hayes, but Noel Kinsey equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a bone in his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{religious}} definitions and varying population data, the United States currently has {{the second largest}} Jewish community in the world (after Israel). The American Jewish population {{was estimated to be}} approximately 5,128,000 (1.7%) of the total population in 2008 (304,060,000). However, it may be as high as 6,444,000 (2.2%). As <b>a</b> <b>contrast,</b> Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the Israeli Jewish population was 5,435,800 in 2007.|$|E

In right field, several versions of the Pepsi Globe {{as well as a}} Pepsi bottle were displayed on large posts behind the stands and lit up every time the Pirates hit a home run. In 2014, the Pirates switched to Coca-Cola. The Pepsi signage in right field was converted into advertising for locally based health insurance company Highmark.|$|E
5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed {{in the studio with}} Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development. Nomura tried to create <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted charisma, and Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of the top ten video game politicians.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|The match started amid clear weather, a far {{cry from}} the {{previous}} Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to its state during World War II, when it was left cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

5|$|The modern red-brick Grundtvig's Church, {{southeast}} of the town centre, was designed by Ole Nielsen. With its strangely shaped, red-tiled roof, it was completed in 1969. Inside, the large wall surfaces are broken only by 12 narrow windows {{on the east side}}, creating <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high {{on the east side of}} the tower.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{population}} {{is almost entirely}} Australian-born; over 90% as of 2011 compared to the average for all Australia of less than 69%. In almost all (96.9%) of homes only English is spoken, again <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to the Australian average of 76.8%. Median income is slightly higher than the country's average and {{the unemployment rate is}} slightly lower.|$|E
5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E

5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E
5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring to act as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> {{to the rest of}} the characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three.|$|E
