[...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Wrubel and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, {{if you let me}} do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thing}} was {{necessary}} to Milton, who wanted to assign some cause or original of the Devil's Rebellion; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> above, the design is well laid, it only wants two Trifles call'd Truth <b>and</b> History; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> leave it to struggle for itself.|$|R
60|$|A fine funny gentleman, thought I, {{not much}} fancying, however, his levity {{concerning}} my great-uncle, he'll be cracking his jokes the whole voyage; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> afterward <b>said</b> {{to one of}} the riggers on board; but he bade me look out, that he did not crack my head.|$|R
60|$|May 11--I do {{not expect}} anybody to believe so astounding a thing, {{and yet it is}} the solemn truth that instead of {{instantly}} sending the dangerous lunatic to the insane asylum (which I naturally supposed they would do, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> prematurely <b>said</b> they had) the court has actually SET HIM AT LIBERTY.

2500|$|Star Treks {{contributions}} to TV history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses {{at that time}} on TV were almost always cast as servants. In fact, Whoopi Goldberg recalled {{that the first time}} she saw Uhura, she excitedly told her mother: [...] "Mama, there's a black woman on television and she ain't no maid!" [...] In an interview, Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her.

6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "Candy has not the {{facilities}} for finding {{people that we}} have. But it takes some {{time for me to}} communicate with head-quarters and for you to hear from there; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, there isn't an hour to be lost.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Captain Eli, reflectively, [...] "we did do it, {{but there}} was always a lackment--Miranda has <b>said</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert {{said from}} behind (again poking me), [...] "Massive <b>and</b> concrete." [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> boldly, as if I had {{originated}} it, and must beg to insist upon it, [...] "Massive and concrete." ...|$|R
60|$|I expect I {{opened my}} mouth and eyes pretty wide, for I was never so astonished. A young lady like that keeping the bar! But I didn't want Mrs. Locky {{to know how much}} I was surprised, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, ma'am; {{but they}} be gone {{to take the}} places of them who may, which is very close connected. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself, Fanny's young man {{was one of the}} regiment, and she's gone after him. There, ma'am, that's it in black and white." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind ye," [...] said Tammas, a drop {{of water}} hanging to the point of his nose, [...] "I {{disclaim}} all responsibility in the business.

5000|$|... "It was {{the worst}} winter ever in this small {{hometown}}.

60|$|I was not {{unprepared}} for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing {{in size and}} vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out {{in the same manner}} as the flies <b>and</b> spiders. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a wonder}} Lettie hasn't {{got up to}} have breakfast with you—she's such a one for raving about the {{perfection}} of the early morning—it's purity <b>and</b> promises <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that in a city said to contain nine hundred {{buildings}} we could do better than hide in a smoke-house, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> claiming that we would be in no more danger by making ourselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances, than if we huddled into some corner.|$|E
60|$|I thought I'd better {{say a word}} or two now, because I didn't {{know where}} Rectus would fetch us up next, if we should give him another chance, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to the {{governor}} that I knew Goliah Brown would make no objections to the plan, because we had talked it over with him, and he had agreed to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I said that," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "I {{wanted to}} do it and <b>I</b> talked <b>and</b> talked, <b>so</b> hard. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> everything <b>I</b> could think of. But that was the only answer: I mustn't do it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thanks; I will," [...] {{returned}} the little fat man, waddling from {{his place in}} the boat and stepping, with some difficulty, upon the sandy beach.

60|$|It {{was another}} ugly question, which I {{determined}} to answer at hap-hazard; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'To General Rolls.'

5000|$|Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg {{was living}} in Needham, MA, {{waiting to see if}} Disney would use his script for Con Air.

6000|$|... "At {{the moment}} I hadn't the {{slightest}} idea what he meant, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> no more to him just then about it.

6000|$|Francesco. [...] Aye, aye--I thought so; [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to one of}} the familiars.

6000|$|Dick fanned {{himself with}} his hat. [...] "I can't think," [...] he said thoughtfully, [...] "whatever 'twas I did to offend Mr. Maybold, a man I like so much too.
