40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of assorted analysis techniques associated with strapdown inertial navigation systems. The process of strapdown system algorithm validation is discussed. Closed-form analytical simulator drivers are described {{that can be used to}} exercise/validate various strapdown algorithm groups. Analytical methods are presented for analyzing the accuracy of strapdown attitude, velocity and position integration algorithms (including position algorithm folding effects) as a function of algorithm repetition rate and system vibration inputs. Included is a description of a simplified analytical model that can be used to translate system vibrations into inertial sensor inputs as a function of sensor <b>assembly</b> <b>mounting</b> imbalances. Strapdown system static drift and rotation test procedures/equations are described for determining strapdown sensor calibration coefficients. The paper overviews Kalman filter design and covariance analysis techniques and describes a general procedure for validating aided strapdown system Kalman filter configurations.

40|$|Progress of {{technology}} on electric vehicle component sector {{is one reason}} the emergence of electric vehicles at the moment. Starting from battery which has a great current density up to the automatic control systems on electric vehicles. But {{there are still some}} shortcomings of this electric vehicle components, one of which is the low value of power density of existing electric motor in the market today. On vehicles such as electric cars when Race Car Contest, energy saving problems about power density of the driving motor is very vital. This is because the total weight of the vehicle has a huge influence on the vehicle efficiency is against it. The issue {{is one of the reasons}} of the research task. In this final task is done making the design, simulation, and architecture of the Axial Halbach Brushless DC Motor. Use of system configuration on the halbach magnet to avoid the use of iron as a material cantilever rotor. By changing the material of the cantilever rotor with lighter materials such as aluminum or even carbon fibre, the value of power density electric motors can be increased. Then using the litz wire on coil stator to reduce loss-power loss due to the barriers on the coil. Coreless stator on the system and to avoid the phenomenon of cogging at the time due to low rpm style attraction magnet with iron in the core material. While the creation process begins by determining the specifications of the Axial Halbach Brushless DC motors. Then go into the design phase of the mechanical and electrical design. Who then conducted simulations to help determine other parameters such as air gap, slot turn, and magnetic orientation. The process of making a component of stator and rotor after the simulation is completed. After all the components of the rotor and stator on <b>assembly,</b> <b>mounting</b> the hall sensor is carried out to the right to position obtained by reading the signals. After the motor can spin with good motor performance, testing can be done. This final task generates Axial Halbach Brushless DC Motor with construction of one rotor and a stator. Axial DC Brushless Halbach Motor consists of 10 pole halbach magnet system permanent and 30 slot on the stator. On the performance test of Axial Halbach Brushless DCMotor it obtained efficiency of 92. 72 %, power output of 807. 34 Watts, torque of 2. 24 Nm, moment rpm 3451.

This investigation documents the upper fuselage velocity flow field {{in support of the}} in-flight acoustic tests conducted on a JetStar airplane.
