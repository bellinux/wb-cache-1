5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book or an ELD. <b>A</b> <b>log</b> book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by <b>a</b> <b>log</b> ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by <b>a</b> <b>log</b> ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by <b>a</b> <b>log</b> ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book. A truck driver's log book is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
50|$|The Java Logging API is {{also not}} <b>a</b> <b>logging</b> framework, but <b>a</b> {{standard}} API for accessing <b>a</b> <b>logging</b> framework.

Many developers confuse this implementation with the Java Logging API.|$|R

5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book, outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record {{the amount of time spent}} driving the vehicle.|$|E

It also provides flexibility in heterogeneous environments where the logging framework is likely to change, although in most cases, once <b>a</b> <b>logging</b> framework has been chosen, there is little need to change it {{over the life of the}} project.|$|R

5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, <b>a</b> <b>log</b> book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature. The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E
