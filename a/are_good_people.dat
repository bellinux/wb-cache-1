500|$|After 1968 the Maharishi {{fell out}} of the public {{spotlight}} for a period and TM was described as a passing fad. Mike Love arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US during the summer of 1968. However, the tour was cancelled after several appearances and was called [...] "one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era". Interest grew again in the mid-1970s when scientific studies began showing concrete results. The Maharishi moved to Europe {{in the early years of}} that decade and appeared twice on American television's The Merv Griffin Show in the mid 1970s, leading to a surge of popularity called the [...] "Merv wave". That was followed by the introduction of [...] "Yogic Flying", a technique which offered the promise of levitation. In a 1975 interview, Harrison said of the Beatles' association with Transcendental Meditation: [...] "In retrospect, that was probably one of the greatest experiences I've ever had … Maharishi was always put down for propagating what was basically a spiritual thing but there's so much being propagated that's damaging to life that I’m glad there <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> around like him." [...] In 1978 Lennon wrote that he considered his meditation a [...] "source of creative inspiration".|$|E

500|$|In 2008, former {{baseball}} players' union chief Marvin Miller, {{trying to}} defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against claims {{that he should not}} be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, [...] "Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as well. I think that by and large, the players, and certainly the ones I knew, <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>people.</b> But the Hall is full of villains." [...] Miller's comment about Anson has no basis, other than speculating that he could have been a Klansman since he was a racist during his playing career, which ended in 1897, although he was umpiring games with black players by 1901, including featuring the all-black Columbia Giants. [...] Miller, age 91 at the time the 2008 article appeared, is the earliest source for declaring that it is factual that Anson {{was a member of the}} Klan, based purely on an Internet search of sources that try to link Anson to the Klan. [...] By contrast, Speaker-Cobb-Rogers Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring to the 1920s (Anson died in 1922), “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, it’s possible that they [...] were briefly in the Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. [...] The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided they were native born, Protestant and white.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bronx {{has been}} {{featured}} significantly in fiction literature. All {{of the characters}} in Herman Wouk's [...] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there.

In Jacob M. Appel's short story, [...] "The Grand Concourse" [...] (2007), a woman {{who grew up in the}} iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter.

2500|$|According to the Romance Writers of America, {{the main}} plot of a romance novel must revolve {{about the two}} people as they develop romantic {{love for each other}} and work to build a relationship. Both the {{conflict}} and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an [...] "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending." [...] Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of Berkley Books, define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the [...] "romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book." [...] In general, romance novels reward characters who <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love. Bestselling author Nora Roberts sums up the genre, saying: [...] "The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want." [...] Women's fiction (including [...] "chick lit") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.|$|E
