25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of}} a top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> down at {{this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E
5000|$|For example, [...] can be {{attached}} to a sentence such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside. The new sentence would look like: <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside. The entire new sentence would therefore read: It is necessary that <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] symbol {{stands for}} any {{statement}} such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside. Therefore {{it could also}} stand for The apple is Red.|$|R

500|$|Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{had already}} worked with Fulci on Sette note in nero. Sacchetti has since stated that his initial script for Zombi 2—originally written {{under the title}} Nightmare Island—had been {{influenced}} by The Island of Doctor Moreau and had been intended to return to [...] "classic zombie tales" [...] such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Walked</b> with a Zombie, The Walking Dead or Voodoo Island. Sacchetti began work on this script in July 1978, before it was optioned by Angelis' company Variety Films that December and re-tooled as Zombi 2. Lead star McCulloch was cast primarily on the success in Italy of the 1975 BBC television series Survivors, which had impressed producer Ugo Tucci.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and {{it occurred to me}} as I was in the room <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
5000|$|But {{the symbol}} [...] {{can be used}} to stand for any {{sentence}} instead of writing out entire sentences. So any sentence such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside or <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> outside and <b>I</b> look around are symbolized by [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Leo," [...] he said, {{after his}} orders had been obeyed. [...] "Hold this coil, and pay it out <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> to the berg {{with the end}} in my hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what nonsense! I {{like these}} verses very much. I will read them <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{along the side}} path, where I shall hear the bees, and catch the flutter of a {{butterfly}} among the words. That {{will be a very}} fitting way to read this poet.' ...|$|R
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement. I ducked down a little bit in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November 1944, {{his unit}} was {{released}} from service. Joseph Ratzinger again returned home. After three weeks passed, he was drafted into the German army at Munich and assigned to the infantry barracks {{in the center of}} Traunstein, the city near which his family lived. After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. [...] "I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out of a railroad underpass, two soldiers were standing at their posts, and for a moment the situation was extremely exciting for me. Thank God that they, too, had had their fill of war {{and did not want to}} become murderers." [...] They used the excuse of his arm being in a sling to let him go home.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day," [...] she declared, [...] "I seem to {{have lost}} confidence. I seem to feel the sense of {{impending}} calamity, to hear the guns <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk,</b> to see the terror fall upon the faces of all these great crowds who throng your streets. They are a stolid, unbelieving people--these. The blow, when it comes, will be the harder." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the land}} shall leave me or take, and the Woman take me or leave me, [...] There shall {{be no more}} Night, or nightmares seen in a glass; [...] But Life shall hold me alive, and Death shall never deceive me [...] As long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> in England in the lanes that let me pass.|$|R
50|$|Habitual {{aspect is}} {{frequently}} expressed in unmarked form in English, <b>as</b> in <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{to work every}} day for ten years, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{to work every day}}, and <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> to work every day after I get well.|$|R
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E

5000|$|... "What impacts me {{immediately}} <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> in, is the smell. I {{just stepped}} outside {{from the bus}} and you smell the pines, the redwoods, the forest ... these earthy, loamy smells. But {{as soon as you}} step into the SHU, it hits you like a wave. It's the smell of despair, depression, desperation. This is a place where people come to die." ...|$|R
5000|$|Adam Freier also {{referenced}} the Army in {{his column}} on Rugby Heaven (Fairfax) [...] "The Rebel Army motto is [...] "by the fans for the fans" ... Never have I been a prouder player <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> past the clan at the games, and never have I felt so normal when I swing by and have a chat. They are very much part of the Rebels team." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, not at all! Of course I must be {{near enough}} to be able to see {{distinctly}} the motion of the lips, say at twenty yards. It is a great amusement to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> about, for <b>I</b> can see what is being said by people on the other side of the road, or passing by in a vehicle. Of course one only gets scraps of conversations, but sometimes they are very funny." ...|$|R
50|$|Connor {{made her}} final {{recordings}} {{in the early}} 2000s, with three albums for HighNote Records. A session in April, 2002 was released <b>as</b> Everything <b>I</b> Love in 2003 as her final album. She also released Haunted Heart. However, her last session a month later, May 17 and 19, 2002, came out first, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> with Music in 2002. The voice is at its darkest. The cover shows a distant, desolate silhouette at night walking on train tracks toward a tunnel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{this is the}} fanciful side of the situation. It has a real side, so {{difficult}} that, though I think of it every day, I never thoroughly think it out. Now, let me determine to think it out <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> home. <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> evade it, <b>as</b> many men--perhaps most men--do evade thinking their way through their greatest perplexity. I will try to pin myself to mine. Don't evade it, John Harmon; don't evade it; think it out! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had taken}} us twenty minutes to arrange our protocols. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> off, well pleased, Lady Georgina's friend ran after me quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ye--es,' {{she replied}} slowly. 'At least, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{down the path}} a voice cried out [...] "Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!" [...] but that was all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{unconscious}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked,</b> it's a positive fact," [...] said Razumov {{to himself in}} wonder. He raised his hat with marked civility.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will allow}} me, at any rate, {{to shake hands}} with you," [...] said Sir Gregory, [...] "and to assure you that I should have lived a broken-hearted man if the truth had been known too late. As it is I tremble and shake in my shoes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> about and think {{of what might have been}} done." [...] Then Phineas gave his hand to Sir Gregory, and from that time forth was {{inclined}} to think well of Sir Gregory.|$|R

"As {{much good}} ground <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> over in two nights {{from the east}} to the west, and from the north to the south <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> over in three nights, the Jungle took. We let in the Jungle upon five villages; and in those villages, and in their lands, the grazing-ground and the soft crop-grounds, {{there is not one}} man to-day who takes his food from the ground. That was the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore, which I and my three sons did; and now I ask, Man-cub, how the news of it came to thee?" [...] said Hathi.|$|R
