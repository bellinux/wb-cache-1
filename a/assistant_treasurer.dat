25|$|In 1869, a {{group of}} speculators, headed by James Fisk and Jay Gould, both {{directors}} of the Erie Railroad, sought to corner the gold market through a plot to induce President Grant to stop Boutwell from releasing weekly gold from the Treasury Department {{in order to raise}} the gold price. Fisk was a gregarious showman who controlled the Erie Railroad, while Gould had made his fortune as a cotton smuggler during the Civil War. The first step in the plan was to recruit Daniel Butterfield, a former Major General and war hero during the Civil War who lacked any experience in finance. Both Corbin and Gould lobbied successfully for Butterfield's appointment as the <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer,</b> through whom Boutwell gave orders to sell Treasury Department gold. Gould bribed Butterfield with a $10,000 check, more than Butterfield's annual salary of $8,000. Butterfield agreed to tip the men off when the government intended to sell gold.|$|E

[...] With Holloway having abandoned Flinders to run in the much friendlier Melbourne Ports, Bruce was returned in absentia to his old seat, regaining it with a swing of 18.5 percent. He was appointed <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer</b> in the new Lyons Government, Lyons having taken the treasury portfolio personally. Lyons leaned heavily on Bruce and Latham in his first six months of government, though Bruce had by now set his sights on international affairs rather than the domestic crisis.|$|E
500|$|The efforts {{undertook}} {{to control the}} gold market and help the national economy {{set the stage for}} a major financial scandal. Jay Gould, a Wall Street trader and railroad magnate, and financier Jim Fisk, seeking to drive up the gold price, enlisted the help of another speculator Abel Corbin, Grant's brother-in-law, who used his connection with the president to get inside information (the collaborators were later known as the [...] "Gold Ring.") Corbin and Gould lobbied for and convinced Grant to appoint Gould's associate, Daniel Butterfield, as <b>Assistant</b> <b>Treasurer,</b> allowing Butterfield to gather information for the Ring. Meanwhile, Gould and Fisk quietly stockpiled gold. Gould convinced Corbin that a high gold price would be good for the nation's prosperity, and Corbin passed this theory on to Grant, who allowed the Treasury to act accordingly. After consulting in early September with Alexander Stewart (his erstwhile nominee for Treasury Secretary), Grant stopped the sale of gold, believing a higher gold price would help Western farmers.|$|E
500|$|Laurens Hammond {{graduated}} from Cornell University with a mechanical engineering degree in 1916. By {{the start of}} the 1920s, he had designed a spring-driven clock, which provided enough sales for him to start his own business, the Hammond Clock Company, in 1928. As well as clocks, his early inventions included three-dimensional glasses and an automatic bridge table shuffler. However, as the Great Depression continued into the 1930s, sales of the bridge table declined and he decided to look elsewhere for a commercially successful product. Hammond was inspired to create the tonewheel or [...] "phonic wheel" [...] by listening to the moving gears of his electric clocks and the tones produced by them. He gathered pieces from a second-hand piano he had purchased for $15 and combined it with a tonewheel generator in a similar form to the telharmonium, albeit much shorter and more compact. Since Hammond was not a musician, he asked the company's <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer,</b> W. L. Lahey, to help him achieve the desired organ sound. To cut costs, Hammond made a pedalboard with only 25 notes, instead of the standard 32 on church organs, and it quickly became a de facto standard.|$|E

2500|$|With the Vietnam war and Yale {{medical school}} choices facing Warner, Warner looked {{to a third}} option based on advice from his father, an {{insurance}} man from Cincinnati, Ohio.

At that time, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (formerly J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated). Over the next seven years, Warner rapidly advanced from officer's assistant (1968–1970), through <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer</b> (1970–1972) and assistant Vice President (1972–1975), to Vice President in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Grant put {{the talented}} George S. Boutwell {{in charge of}} the U.S. Treasury. [...] Boutwell's primary task was to reduce the {{national}} debt. To accomplish this, in April, Boutwell ordered his <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer</b> to sell gold from the Treasury and buy up wartime bonds. He also initiated reforms in the Treasury Department by improving methods of tax collecting and attacking the problem of counterfeiting. By the end of May, the national debt had been reduced by $12 million. Boutwell's treasury policy of reducing the national debt kept the money supply level and the gold price artificially low. The purpose of Grant's fiscal policy was {{to reduce the amount of}} greenbacks in circulation that could be redeemed in gold at some future date.|$|E
2500|$|In 1636, a {{group of}} {{settlers}} led by the Massachusetts Bay Colony's <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer,</b> William Pynchon founded Springfield, Massachusetts, after first scouting the region's most advantageous location for trading and farming. To Pynchon's surprise, it {{had not yet been}} settled. [...] "Agawam," [...] as Springfield was originally called, is located just north of the Connecticut River's first falls that are unnavigable by seagoing vessels. It also sits amidst the fertile valley that contains New England's best agricultural land and lies equidistant to the ports of Boston and Albany. Unlike the three settlements south of Springfield at the time – Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, Connecticut – the Natives surrounding Springfield were friendly. In 1640, Pynchon annexed Springfield to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Colony, because he believed that Connecticut's harsh policies toward the Natives were bad for both business and survival. Thus in 1640, with the annexation of Springfield, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's southern and western borders were established.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Bartlett Richards bought 20,000 head {{of cattle}} from Mexico and in November of that year a very strong snow storm {{incapacitated}} the area. [...] "The Spade lost 10,000 of those cattle," [...] Lawrence said, [...] "and there was a pile of hides in Ellsworth {{as high as the}} depot." [...] Lawrence and his brother Ona skinned cattle for 50 cents a head, 25 cents per calf and everyday the intense cold brought more losses to the Spade. When Lawrence was old enough to file on a homestead, he described his land on the Alkali Lake Meadow as a quarter-mile deep and two miles wide, but he met requirements and received patent on the string of 40's in 1918. In 1925 Brass and Meyers arranged with Lawrence to buy the hay and have him care for and feed their cattle which were branded with Sandhills Land and Cattle Company's Sugar Bowl brand. Early on, Brass assisted Bixby with a $2,000.00 ($24,031.37 current) down payment on a loan to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) of the Spade land. [...] Beginning in 1925, Bixby slowly began to obtain sections of the old Spade Ranch range by hard work and perseverance, aided by bankers willing to take a chance. In 1926, Brass and Meyers suggested Bixby move to the ranch headquarters in the Spade home valley. The same year Lawrence was asked by the Union Pacific <b>assistant</b> <b>treasurer</b> C.T. Cullen for permission to bring a hunting party to the Spade and {{for a number of years}} the men came in a private railroad car, bringing their own cook and paid handsomely for hunting rights on Bixby land and lakes. Mr. Cullen dropped by the day Lawrence was checking applications for the district school, where he was a board member. [...] "Hire this one with the Irish eyes," [...] Mr. Cullen suggested and in time Miss Eleanor Riordan of York, Nebraska began teaching Cherry County District #168. Lawrence conscientiously kept in touch with the young teacher and the day after her term ended they were married in Alliance, Nebraska on May 26, 1927.|$|E
