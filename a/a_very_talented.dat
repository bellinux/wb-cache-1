5|$|Employees {{arrive at}} a Dunder Mifflin company picnic, where Michael (Steve Carell) plans to win back his ex-girlfriend Holly (Amy Ryan), whom he has not seen since she was {{transferred}} to Nashua. Holly arrives with her boyfriend A. J. (Rob Huebel), who tells Michael the couple are designing a house together. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) allows Michael and Holly to do a presentation {{about the history of}} Dunder Mifflin, and the two spend time in the woods to come up with ideas. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) run into Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{for the first time since}} he left Scranton, and Charles is still short with Jim. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) brings his new best friend, Rolf (James Urbaniak), who makes constant insults to Angela (Angela Kinsey) for breaking Dwight's heart; Dwight tells Rolf to stop, much to Angela's surprise. The Scranton branch competes in the picnic's volleyball tournament, facing off the other branches of Dunder Mifflin.

25|$|The {{preparation}} for the next season for Žalgiris began during the 2016 LKL finals, with Žalgiris signing point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle. After the season, Pocius, Hanlan, Vougioukas, and long time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars, all left the team, while Žalgiris choose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum. Žalgiris also re-signed Edgaras Ulanovas. One of {{the main stories of}} the off-season became the situation of head coach Jasikevičius, who was pursued by FC Barcelona Bàsquet to become their new head coach, but in the end decided to remain with Žalgiris. During the entire previous season, the main problem for the team was the lack of a good shooter – to fix the problem, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos, and to replace Vougioukas at center, Žalgiris took Augusto Lima from Real Madrid on loan. Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal. Isaiah Hartenstein, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> prospect from Germany, who was signed during the previous season, is also scheduled to make his debut in the upcoming season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas, in a rather controversial decision, as Kavaliauskas had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris, with Kavaliauskas apologizing to fans soon after the signing was announced. With the signing of Kavaliauskas, the formation of the team was complete. In February, Žalgiris won the first title of the 2017 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating BC Neptūnas in the first round 81:58, BC Vytautas in the semi-finals 76:55, and BC Lietkabelis in the finals 84:63, while rival and 2016 champion Lietuvos rytas was eliminated in the first round. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP. In the Euroleague, Žalgiris exceeded all expectations – many pre-season experts believed that Žalgiris will finish in last place, which motivated the team. Under leadership of coach Jasikevičius, Žalgiris finished in 10th place, just 2 games out of the playoffs, with wins over teams like PBC CSKA Moscow, the defending champion, playoff teams like Saski Baskonia, Anadolu Efes S.K. and Panathinaikos B.C., and beating and actually finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Bàsquet and Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., with a 14–16 record. Players like Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas and Lukas Lekavičius blossomed and shined, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding. The LKL became a formality, as Žalgiris easily finished in 1st place with just a few losses, and easily crushed and swept long tome rival Lietuvos rytas. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris beat BC Dzūkija in the quaterfinals 3:0, beat BC Neptūnas 3:1 in the semi-finals, and faced BC Lietkabelis in the finals, as Lietkabelis beat Rytas in the semi-final. The only team to give Žalgiris some trouble in the regular season, Lietkabelis fought hard, but a win in Game 2 would be the only win of the series – Žalgiris won the series 4:1, their 7th consecutive LKL championship and finished a very good season. The 2016–2017 season is considered {{as one of the best}} in modern Žalgiris history.|$|E

500|$|Certainly he {{must have}} been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> writer, gaining a {{reputation}} of eloquence while he still lived in London (Bethurum, 58). [...] In a letter to him, [...] "the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop’s skill" [...] (58). [...] Similarly, [...] "ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose" [...] (Continuations, 229). [...] This suggests Wulfstan's writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm (229). [...] Taking a look at Wulfstan's actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured– even his notes in the margins are well organised and tidy, and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable.|$|E

500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|Eddie Colón was {{expelled}} from the hotel and tried to attend his brother's training, but he received the same response and was denied access, buying a ticket for an OVW show held that night. After the event's start, Carly Colón was shown arriving late and being scolded by Jim Cornette. This skit reflected real conflicts between both. Cornette has stated that during Colón's stay in OVW he considered him <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> performer, capable of doing [...] "great stuff" [...] but only did it when he [...] "was on" [...] due to being used {{to be treated as}} [...] "wrestling royalty" [...] in his role of [...] "the boss' son". Cornette went on to explain the limited role, saying that: [...] "I didn't feature Carlito, because he thought that he was more advanced {{than the rest of the}} guys and was cruising... But that wasn't what I wanted to see". Colón rebuffed this by saying that [...] "they could have done more" [...] with him in OVW and that the reason no to do it was because [...] "Jim Cornette [...] like" [...] him.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E

500|$|On 16 May 2011, Brodie {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011–12 for a five-figure loan fee. Homesickness was {{cited as the}} reason for the transfer, with manager Evans saying [...] "Richard is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> lad but it is no secret he has failed to settle away from his family home". Brodie debuted as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood's 2–0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011. His first goal for Fleetwood was the team's fifth goal in a 5–2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011. Brodie's sixth goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport, when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2–2 in front of 3,029 supporters, a record home league attendance for Fleetwood. He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012, the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute, which made the score 3–0 to Fleetwood. Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card, although his team {{went on to win the}} match 6–0. He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011–12 and won his second Conference Premier winner's medal in as many seasons, as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
