In the end Williamson lost out to newcomer Ryan Perry and was sent down to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Detroit manager Jim Leyland praised Williamson's experience: [...] "I think Scott Williamson has an excellent chance...You're talking about <b>a</b> pretty <b>big-time</b> Major League pitcher at one time." [...] Once in Toledo, however, Williamson had difficulties making a consistent outing and his ERA climbed steadily.

5000|$|When {{the film}} was released, The New York Times film critic, Thomas M. Pryor, panned the film, writing, [...] "In Race Street, a {{regulation}} melodrama which opened Saturday at the Mayfair, George Raft is playing <b>a</b> regulation <b>big-time</b> bookie who is harassed by regulation muscle-men. In fact, everything about this dreary exercise in violence is strictly formula, depressingly juvenile and dull...Mr. Raft, an old hand at this sort of thing, handles himself with ease and authority, and William Bendix {{does a good job}} as the detective. There is even professional dexterity to the direction, but all this energy is completely wasted on a shoddy, routine story." ...|$|R

[...] Further contact with several government agencies solidified his suspicions that Glass had fabricated the entire story. More suspicious was the fact that [...] "Jukt Micronics" [...] only had one phone line, and its website {{turned out to be an}} amateur AOL webpage, which seemed very odd for <b>a</b> supposedly <b>big-time</b> software company.|$|R

In the process, Bill Virdon {{was fired in}} favor of Bob Lillis. During this time, Dickie Thon was {{emerging}} as a premier shortstop, hitting 20 homers in 1983.

25|$|Hawkeye enjoys many adventures {{with the}} Avengers and proves himself a hero on {{numerous}} occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial {{moment in a}} battle, Clint decides to adopt a new costume and identity by succeeding Hank Pym as the new Goliath. Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother Barney, who had become <b>a</b> <b>big-time</b> racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States {{and came to the}} Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.) Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the Kree-Skrull War Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the Vision over the affections of the Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.|$|E

5000|$|Bosley Crowther, {{film critic}} for The New York Times, was caustic about the casting and the {{adaption}} of Cain's novel, and wrote: [...] "Rhonda Fleming and a laughably kittenish Arlene Dahl, {{are a couple}} of on-the-make sisters, and the fellow, played by John Payne, is <b>an</b> on-the-make <b>big-time</b> gangster. In the end all their faces are red. So, we say, should be the faces of the people responsible for this film, which {{is said to have been}} taken from a novel (unrecognizable) of James M. Cain.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket in 2001 was generally positive. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone was generally the most effusive {{of the positive}} reviews, praising the unpretentious attitude of the band: [...] "As they plow in their relatively un-self-conscious way through the emotional hurdles of lust, terror, pain and rage, they reveal more about themselves and their audience than they even intend to, turning adolescent malaise into a friendly joke rather than a spiritual crisis." [...] Darren Ratner of AllMusic felt likewise, writing that the record is [...] "one of their finest works to date, with almost every track sporting a commanding articulation and new-school punk sounds. They've definitely put <b>a</b> <b>big-time</b> notch in the win column". People commended the [...] "adrenaline-laced sonic gems reveling in blink's patented, potty-mouthed humor, recommended only for adolescents of all ages". British publication Q offered the sentiment that [...] "when they stop arsing around {{for the sake of}} it, Blink-182 write some very good pop songs".

He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with <b>a</b> <b>big-time</b> announcement....

5000|$|College {{football}} is a controversial institution within American higher education, where {{the amount of}} money involved—what people will pay for the entertainment provided—is a corrupting factor within universities that they are usually ill-equipped to deal with. According to William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University of Maryland System and co-director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, [...] "We've reached <b>a</b> point where <b>big-time</b> intercollegiate athletics is undermining the integrity of our institutions, diverting presidents and institutions from their main purpose." [...] Football coaches often make more than the presidents of their universities which employ them. Athletes are alleged to receive preferential treatment both in academics and when they run afoul of the law. Although in theory {{football is}} an extra-curricular activity engaged in as a sideline by students, it is widely believed to turn a substantial profit, from which the athletes receive no direct benefit. There has been serious discussion about making student-athletes university employees to allow them to be paid. In reality, the majority of major collegiate football programs operated at a financial loss in 2014.|$|R
