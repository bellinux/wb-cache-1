40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} commercial bank size heterogeneity on heterogeneity in efficiency using a heteroscedastic stochastic frontier model. This model is implemented by using an information theoretic maximum entropy approach. This study is unique in two ways. We explicitly model both bank size and variance heterogeneity simultaneously. Since the one-sided error structure does not conform to standard distributional assumptions, we adopt a maximum entropy estimation procedure to estimate both the cost frontier and the second moments of the one-sided inefficiency term.

40|$|This {{research}} primarily {{examines the}} trends of changing characteristics of corporate boards within New Zealand listed firms. Expressing in a quantitative framework, this research provides an insight of how board compositions {{have changed over}} the past decade, within which two major corporate governance legislative reforms have occurred. These two reforms are known as the Companies Act in 1993 and the New Zealand Corporate Governance Best Practice Code in 2003. This study aims to cover {{a full range of}} board characteristics mentioned in previous related literatures in order to give a more complete view. Sixteen variables are selected and examined: board size, board independence, multiple directorships, CEO compensation, chair <b>and</b> <b>director</b> <b>fees,</b> CEO duality, gender diversity, staggered board, directors' ownership, director tenure, directors' experience, committee existence, committee independence, CEO involvement on board committees, board and committee Meetings, directors' educational and industrial background. Within the above variables, board size, board independence and CEO duality receives the most attention from New Zealand investors and regulators. Tendencies of movements regarding these characteristics appear to collaborate with public expectations. Board size has decreased while independence has increased throughout the periods examined. CEO duality phenomenon sharply reduced during the periods after 2003 legislative reform. Committee independence has also grown according to the public recognition, especially for audit committees. CEO involvements on board committees are less than before. Boards within New Zealand listed firms desire more diversification of both gender <b>and</b> backgrounds of <b>directors.</b> These findings fill the gap of the evolution of corporate boards’ characteristics of New Zealand listed firms over the past decade...|$|R

40|$|This study {{uses the}} current {{financial}} crisis as a quasi-experiment {{to examine whether}} {{and to what extent}} corporate boards affect the performance of firms. Using cumulative stock returns over the crisis to measure of firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we re-define independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call true independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. Third, board meeting frequencies, <b>director</b> <b>attendance</b> behaviors, <b>and</b> <b>director</b> age also affect firm performance during the crisis. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards...|$|R

In addition to this, we explain the channel through which female <b>directors</b> affect audit <b>fees</b> by considering the role of their specific (statutory and demographic) attributes. Initially, we find that gender diverse boards pay higher audit fees. However, the consideration of specific (i. e., statutory and demographic) attributes in analysis changes the nature of the association between female <b>directors</b> <b>and</b> audit <b>fees</b> from positive to negative. This suggest that the simple presence of female directors is a necessary but not sufficient condition, because for improving the effectiveness of internal control system or enhancing the integrity of financial reporting process individuals must have particular competencies and skills. With regard to how female <b>directors</b> affect audit <b>fees,</b> we find that female directors with business expertise and prior experience reduce the need for assurance provided by external auditors which results in less audit fee. However, female chairs and audit committee members demand incremental audit effort from external auditors to ensure audit quality which translates in higher audit fee...|$|R

This study will focus on how gender diversity, ethnic diversity, literacy among women directors, female multiple directorships, frequency of meeting <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> women independent <b>directors</b> affect the capital structure and financial performance of Malaysian public listed companies. This study selects 100 companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia through application of simple random sampling method for a period of two years, i. e. 2002 to 2013. Financial measures such as Tobin’s Q, Return on Asset, and Return on Equity ratios were used as measure of company performance, where as we use Debt to Asset and Debt to Equity ratios for capital structure measures in this study. With relevant quantitative analysis methods such as descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation and regression test, the findings of this paper shows that there is a positive relationship between female director characteristics such as numbers of female directors on board, female director frequency of attendance to board meeting, female <b>director</b> literacy <b>and</b> female multiple directorships with company performance.

40|$|Despite proven {{effects of}} {{preventative}} parent management training (PMT) programs, empirical evidence on predictors {{and effects of}} treatment <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> engagement is scarce. As PMT programs are often plagued by low <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> engagement, this study explored predictors of <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> engagement {{and the effects of}} <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> engagement on parenting and child behavior. This research targeted one highly at-risk population, 173 currently or formerly incarcerated mothers (Mage = 33. 61) and their two to ten year-old (M = 7. 28) children. In total 144 mothers participated in evidence-based “Incredible Years Parent Training” groups, and 29 mothers opted out. Engagement was coded per session for every mother from group leader notes. Mothers who opted out of the intervention were more often recruited after incarceration ended and were lower educated, suggesting the importance of strong recruitment during incarceration and personalized follow-up upon release. Group dynamics increased <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> other mothers’ engagement increased engagement. <b>Attendance</b> <b>and</b> engagement were examined as predictors of parent <b>and</b> child outcomes. <b>Attendance</b> increased positive parenting, but no other parent or child outcomes. Engagement was not uniquely predictive of parent and child outcomes. Future research should explicitly measure engagement including self-reports, and pay particular attention to group dynamics.
