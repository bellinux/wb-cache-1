25|$|Chicken McNuggets – {{introduced}} in 1983 {{as a replacement}} for the McChicken, these are small chicken chunks served with dipping sauces of barbecue, sweet n' sour, honey, and hot mustard. Available in 4, 6, 10 (originally 9), or 20 pieces. Up until 2003, they were a combination of white and dark meat, now they are made with only white meat. In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chilli, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the Hot Mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredients}} and spiciness of hamin varies from area to area. Iraqi Jews prepare {{their version of}} cholent, known as tebit, with a whole chicken stuffed with rice. Jews from Morocco or Iberia make a version called adafina or dafina, which calls for spices like garlic, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and pepper, as well as whole eggs that turn brown <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> during the long cooking process. The Spanish cocido ('stew') containing chicken and chickpeas is a likely offshoot of the traditional hamin of the Spanish Jews. Yemenite Jews have developed various kinds of puff pastry cooked for ten hours, including jahnoun and kuban (eaten {{in the morning of}} the Sabbath rather than at mid-day, with dairy meals).|$|E

25|$|Identifying {{mushrooms}} {{requires a}} basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are Basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, <b>and</b> <b>creamy,</b> but almost never blue, green, or red.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, saffron {{has been used}} as a fabric dye, {{particularly}} in China and India. It is in the long run an unstable colouring agent; the imparted vibrant orange-yellow hue quickly fades to a pale <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> yellow. Even in minute amounts, the saffron stamens yield a luminous yellow-orange; increasing the applied saffron concentration will give fabric of increasingly rich shades of red. Clothing dyed with saffron was traditionally reserved for the noble classes, implying that saffron played a ritualised and status-keying role. It was originally responsible for the vermilion-, ochre-, and saffron-hued robes and mantles worn by Buddhist and Hindu monks. In medieval Ireland and Scotland, well-to-do monks wore a long linen undershirt known as a léine, which was traditionally dyed with saffron. In histology the hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) stain and Movat's pentachrome stain are used as a tissue stain to make biological structures more visible under a microscope. Saffron stains collagen yellow.|$|E
25|$|The {{tarantula}} hawk’s namesake {{comes from}} its predation of tarantulas {{to raise their}} young. After mating, the female wasp will seek out a tarantula, either free ranging or in its burrow. After grappling with the tarantula, the wasp will deliver a powerful sting that essentially paralyzes the tarantula permanently, but keeps it alive. This allows the wasp to lay an egg that adheres to the spider’s abdomen. One tarantula is provisioned per egg. The egg is about 5 millimeters long, gently curved, <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> white in color. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed tarantula along with the egg, sometimes up to 100 meters, to a cavity or burrow to be sealed. This dugout can be either dug by the wasp or be the burrow of the paralyzed spider. When the larva hatches, it will feed on the spider’s guts to completion, keeping the spider alive {{for as long as}} possible for freshness.|$|E

25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E

500|$|Surviving medieval recipes {{frequently}} {{call for}} flavoring {{with a number}} of sour, tart liquids. Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive [...] "pungeant, fruity" [...] flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds. They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk. This last type of non-dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> texture.|$|E
500|$|Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News {{felt that}} the song {{was the only one}} from the album in which Jackson {{successfully}} revisited his past. The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper [...] "You Are Not Alone", as it sounded to him like a track that could have been written by R.

Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward [...] "neo-gospel". The New York Post said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "lullaby-like" [...] and the best song on Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's [...] "long lines <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> overdubbed choruses [...] weightlessly" [...] in the ballad, that the journalist felt it was a love song to God.|$|E
500|$|Beecher's cheeses {{differ from}} similar cheeses {{in that they}} mix cheese growth {{cultures}} in unusual ways. For example, their signature [...] "Flagship" [...] cheese includes cultures typically used for non-cheddar cheeses, such as Gruyère and Emmental, changing the nature, flavor, and texture of their cheddar. Flagship cheese is produced using a cheddaring process, but owing to a different taste, Beecher's does not call this cheese cheddar. The cheese {{has been described as}} having a [...] "sweet finish <b>and</b> <b>creamy</b> texture" [...] unlike the tangier cheddars, owing to this being one of the cheeses they create with a mixture of different cheese cultures. After being prepared in [...] blocks and aged for approximately one year, the Flagship—unlike cheddars—lacks a rind, is moister, resembles butter visually, and carries a milky aroma due to being aged in plastic bags. A variant called [...] "Flagship Reserve" [...] is aged in cheese cloth in [...] sizes on racks in open air, and is rubbed with butter while being turned daily. This preparation method causes the Reserve to lose up to 12% of its initial weight by the time it is completed. The Reserve is aged for a shorter amount of time, leading to a sharper, nuttier taste and texture, according to Food & Wine Magazine. Of the [...] of cheese they produce annually, approximately [...] will be Flagship, and only [...] will be Flagship Reserve.|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comThe aim of this work was to study {{the effect of the}} addition of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on instrumental textural properties, sensory texture profile analysis, and microstructure of fresh and frozen/thawed mashed potatoes formulated without and with added cryoprotectants (kappa-carrageenan [k-C] and xanthan gum [XG]). EVOO behaves as soft filler due to droplet aggregates, whereas addition of cryoprotectants led to more structured mashed potatoes (MP) thanks to the gelling properties of k-C. Both the percentage of added EVOO and processing had a much less significant effect on the texture of the MP containing k-C and XG, evidencing the ability of this biopolymer blend to impart freeze/thaw stability. All samples with added EVOO were perceived as significantly softer <b>and</b> <b>creamier</b> than the samples without EVOO, whereas all MP samples with added cryoprotectants were perceived as significantly thicker <b>and</b> <b>creamier</b> than those without hydrocolloids.
