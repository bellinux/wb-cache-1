40|$|The {{analysis}} of degraded DNA can be problematic. Recent {{advances in the}} identification and {{analysis of}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated the advantage of these markers over short tandem repeats (STRs) in that they only require small amplicons. However, before applying to casework, {{it is important to}} develop allele frequency databases from relevant populations. The main aim of the study is to characterize three Malaysian major ethnic groups; Malay, Chinese and Indian, using 52 autosomal SNP markers that have been identified in the SNPforID project. Sanchez et. al., 2006 reported a multiplex of 52 SNP markers in one PCR reaction with two single base reaction (SBE) in the detection of SNPs using capillary electrophoresis (CE). The amplicons for PCR ranged from 59 bp to 115 bp. Whilst for SBE reactions ranged from 16 nt to 92 nt. In their study, full complete profile was obtained from 500 pg DNA input. The study was carried out on three major populations: African, Asian and European. As in this study, a total of 325 Malaysian samples (109 from Malays, 107 from Chinese and 109 from Indians) were genotyped. In order to genotype the population samples reliably and robustly, four sets of 13 -plex SNPs were developed. Internal validation was carried out using both genetic analyzers, ABI PRISM® 310 and 3500 Genetic <b>Analyzer.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> and reproducibility studies demonstrated that the assays were highly sensitive, requiring as little as 30 pg of DNA.

In this approach, the diffusion ion loss remains minimal in the non-uniform electric field in the cylindrical part of the device, and all ion losses under Uripple occur in a short portion of their path.

When operated at a temperature of 170 C, the analyzer functions as a total nonmethane hydrocarbon <b>analyzer</b> with <b>sensitivities</b> 10 [...] 1, 000 times better than a conventional FID. However, with operation at varying temperatures, the chemiluminescent signal reflects the differences in rates of reaction of the hydrocarbons with ozone. Preliminary studies at room temperature indicated that the relative rates of reaction of isoprene, {alpha}-pinene, {beta}-pinene, and limonene with ozone correlated with the observed chemiluminescence signal. When hydrocarbons are grouped in classes of similar structure, their rates of reaction with electrophilic atmospheric oxidants (e. g., OH, O{sub 3 }, NO{sub 3 }) can be correlated with each other. By varying the temperature of the reaction chamber, the chemiluminescence analyzer can be tuned to more reactive classes of hydrocarbons.

40|$|Noninvasive methodologies for {{measuring}} carcinogen exposure in humans, {{based on the}} use of urinary markers, are being developed and validated for use in molecular epidemiological studies. A range of 3 -alkyladenines can be determined in urine samples by an immunoaffinity purification-GC/MS approach [3 -methyladenine, 3 -ethyladenine, 3 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) adenine, and 3 -benzyladenine]. Using this method, recent results in human subjects suggest that urinary 3 -alkyladenines are potentially useful markers of alkylating agent exposure, particularly where the backgrounds of such adducts are much lower than 3 -methyladenine. Urinary excretion of S-benzylmercapturic acid has been studied in experimental animals as a marker of exposure to benzylating agents such as N-nitroso-methylbenzylamine. 3 -Nitrotyrosine (NTyr) is formed in vivo in tissue or blood proteins after exposure to nitrosating and/or nitrating agents such as tetranitromethane. After turnover of proteins, NTyr is released and excreted in urine as metabolites 3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxy-phenylacetic acid and 3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid, which are determined by GC with a thermal energy <b>analyzer.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity, combined with ease of use, of these noninvasive biomonitoring approaches means that they may be readily incorporated into molecular epidemiological studies in which exposure to nitrosating and alkylating agents may be important risk factors...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Patients admitted to our hospital suspected of having UTI, with positive urine cultures were {{included in this study}} from a 2 -year period (January 2011 to December 2012). Dipstick urinalysis was done using multistix 10 SG (Siemens) and clinitek advantus <b>analyzer.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> of dipstick nitrites, leukocyte esterase and blood in these culture-positive UTI patients was calculated retrospectively.

The sensitivity of blood alone in positive urine culture was 63. 94 %, which was the highest sensitivity for a single screening test. The presence of leukocyte esterase and/or blood increased the sensitivity to 72. 28 %. The sensitivity was found to be the highest when nitrite, leukocyte and blood were considered together. Conclusions: Nitrite test and leukocyte esterase test when used individually is not reliable to rule out UTI. Hence, symptomatic UTI patients with negative dipstick assay should be subjected to urine culture for a proper management...|$|R

40|$|CEL I {{endonuclease}} cleavage of heteroduplex DNA {{is noted}} as an efficient, high-throughput technique for scanning homologous sequences for subtle variations. A significant shortcoming of the CEL I technique, however, is the poor signal-to-noise ratio obtained when using a PCR-based, 5 ’-end-fluorophore-labelled detection platform. Normally, {{the sensitivity of}} fluorescent-based PAGE/CE is many fold superior to the UV visualization of intercalated dyes following agarose electrophoresis. Recent literature, however, reports that maximum pooling capacities are overall similar, when comparing sophisticated fluorophore-labelled detection platforms with more basic ethidium-stained techniques. CEL I has been hypothesized to reduce signal strength of end-labelled amplicon fragments via non-specific exonucleolytic activity, which acts to cleave off 5 ’-end bases and their covalently-linked fluorophores. Typical CEL I protocols involve only short digestion times {{in an attempt to}} limit the loss of true-nicked signal via any undesired exonucleolytic activity.

The method is based on removing the impurities from a solution of alpha HNIW (α-HNIW) by a chemical reaction to obtain pure epsilon form. For comparison, selected different published methods for recrystallization of HNIW to obtain the epsilon form were studied. All the selected methods are based on solvent-antisolvent technique. The optimum parameters, such as type of solvent and anti-solvent, volume ratio of solvent to anti-solvent, rate of addition, speed of stirring, etc., were applied to enhance the crystal {{size and shape of}} ε-HNIW. Checking the polymorphs of the obtained HNIW was done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

The drugs investigated were the analgesics Ibuprofen, Fenoprofen, Ketoprofen, Naproxen, and Diclofenac. The recently introduced Q 2 -pulsing function, which enhances the transmission of fragment ions of a selected m/z window from the collision cell into the TOF <b>analyzer,</b> improved the <b>sensitivity</b> of product ion scans on the quadrupole/TOF instrument. The selectivity is much better on quadrupole/TOF systems than on triple quadrupoles because the high resolving power of the reflectron-TOF mass analyzer permits high-accuracy fragment ion selection. This minimizes interferences from environmental matrices and allows acquisition of full spectra for selected analytes with better signal-to-noise characteristics than comparable spectra obtained with a scanned quadrupole. The qualitative information obtained (mass accuracy, resolution and full-scan spectra) by hybrid quadrupole/TOF mass spectrometry allows a more certain identification of analytes in environmental matrices at trace levels. Sample enrichment of water samples was achieved by a solid-phase extraction procedure. Average recoveries for loading 1 L of samples varied from 88 to 110 %, and the quantification limits were less than 1. 2 ng/L for the triple-quadrupole instrument (in MRM mode) and less than 3 ng/L for the quadrupole/TOF instrument.

It consists {{of a set of}} concentric toroidal electrodes that form a number of independent energy selective channels. Charged particles are deflected towards a common imaging planar detector. The full 3 D distribution function of charged particles is obtained through a single energy sweep. Angle and energy resolution of the optics depends on the number of toroidal electrodes, on their radii of curvature, on their spacing, and on the angular aperture of the channels. We present the performances, as derived from numerical simulations, of an initial implementation of this concept that would fit the need of many space plasma physics applications. The proposed instrument has 192 entrance windows corresponding to 8 polar channels each with 24 azimuthal sectors. The initial version of this 3 D plasma analyzer may cover energies from a few eV up to 30 [*]keV, typically with a channel dependent energy resolution varying from 10 % to 7 %.

Here we report that this instrument can efficiently characterize protein mixtures by alternating MS and “all-ion fragmentation” (AIF) MS/MS scans {{in a manner similar}} to that previously described for quadrupole time-of-flight instruments. We applied the peak recognition algorithms of the MaxQuant software at both the precursor and product ion levels.

For efficient fragmentation of different mass precursors, we implemented a stepped collision energy procedure with cumulative MS readout. AIF on the Exactive identified 45 of 48 proteins in an equimolar protein standard mixture and all of them when using a small database. The technique also identified proteins with more than 100 -fold abundance differences in a high dynamic range standard. When applied to protein identification in gel slices, AIF unambiguously characterized an immunoprecipitated protein that was barely visible by Coomassie staining and quantified it relative to contaminating proteins.

40|$|An {{approach}} is presented {{that can be}} of general applicability for structural elucidation of naturally occurring (GLSs) in crude plant extracts based on the fragmentation of isotopic A and A + 2 peaks. The most important fragmentation pathways were studied by tandem mass spectrometry (MSn, n = 2, 3) using a linear quadrupole ion trap (LTQ) upon GLSs separation by optimized reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative ion mode. As the LTQ MS <b>analyzer</b> ensures high <b>sensitivity</b> and linearity, the fragmentation behavior under collision induced dissociation (CID) of the isotopic peaks A and A + 2 as precursor ions was carefully examined. All GLSs (R-C 7 H 11 O 9 NS 2 -) share a common structure {{with at least two}} sulfur atoms and significant isotopic abundance of 34 S. Thus, dissociation of the + 2 Da isotopomeric ions results in several fragment ion doublets containing a combination of 32 S and 34 S. Accordingly, their relative abundances allow one to speed up the structural recognition of GLSs with great confidence, as it produces more structurally informative ions than conventional tandem MS performed on A ions. This approach has been validated on known GLSs bearing two, three, four, and six sulfur atoms by comparing expected and measured isotopic peak abundance ratios (IA/IA+ 2). Both group- and compound-specific fragments were observed; the predominant pathway of fragmentation of GLSs gives rise to species having the following m/z values, [M - SO 3 - H]-, [M - 196 - H]-, [M - 178 - H]-, and [M - 162 - H]- after H rearrangement from the R- side chain. The present strategy was successfully applied to extracts of rocket salad leaves (Eruca sativa L.), which was sufficient for the chemical identification of a not already known 6 -methylsulfonyl- 3 -oxohexyl-GLS, a long-chain-length aliphatic glucosinolate, which contains three sulfurs and exhibits a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 494. ...|$|R

The 128 samples were dried separately in 1.5  mL Eppendorf tubes on a heating block at 50  °C for 16 – 24  h, before weighing their respective dry mass (Additional file 1). Specimens were grinded in their respective tube by five zirconia beads (2.0  mm Zirconia Beads, BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, USA) at 6  m/s for 3 [*]×[*] 45  s on a FastPrep®- 24 tissue grinder (MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany). DNA was extracted from the grinded tissue using a modified salt extraction protocol [65]; modified by [74], followed by an RNA digestion step using 1  µL RNase A on 50  µL sample for 30  min at 37  °C and a clean-up step using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) to minimize the concentration of possible inhibitors prior to PCR. DNA concentrations of the extracted and cleaned-up samples were measured using the Qubit 2.0 (Broad Range Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA) and diluted to 25  ng/µL. DNA was amplified using a two-step PCR protocol. In the first step, DNA was amplified using illustra puretaq ready-to-go PCR beads (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Little Chalfont, UK) with 12.5  ng DNA and 0.5  µM of each primer (BF 2, BR 2; [17]) filled up to 25  µL with sterile H 2 O at: 94  °C for 3  min initial denaturation, followed by 25 cycles of 94  °C for 30  s denaturation, 50  °C for 30  s annealing, 72  °C for 2  min elongation, and final elongation at 72  °C for 5  min. PCR success was validated by gel electrophoresis before the PCR product was cleaned-up using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) to remove any bovine serum albumin (BSA) from the samples.

The first library consisted of all samples from the experimental blocks 1 and 4 and the second library of all samples from experimental blocks 2 and 3. Pooled this way, both libraries contained an equal amount of samples from both microhabitats (32 streambed and 32 leaf litter samples per library), an equal amount of samples per treatment (four replicates of each treatment combination) and nearly the same number of chironomid specimens (29, 915 specimens [block 1 and 4] versus 29, 410 specimens [block 2 and 3]). A left-sided size selection was performed for both libraries using 0.76 × SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany).

Raw data were processed with R JAMP v 023 ([URL] Sequences were assigned to their original sample using the module Demultiplexing_shifted, followed by paired-end merging using Usearch (v 10.0. 240, [14]) through the JAMP module U_merge_PE. Reverse complement sequences were generated where necessary and quality filtering was conducted (maxee[*]=[*] 1; [14]). Pre-processing of sequences included primer removal (Cutadapt v 1.9; [43]) discarding of reads[*]±[*] 10  bp of the expected length and dereplication with removing singletons. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was conducted (97 % similarity) and clusters with at least 0.01 % abundance in one sample (after mapping of the reads including singletons) were included for further analyses. After remapping the remaining reads of OTUs that were discarded in the first filtering step, a second filtering step was conducted for each sample separately, in which only OTUs with an abundance of at least 0.01 % in the respective sample were retained. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomic group by comparison with the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD, [URL] accessed 02.08. 2017) as implemented in JAMP. Since a 4 – 5 % threshold has been suggested to be appropriate to delineate species of the chironomid genus Tanytarsus [39], we carried out a second analysis using a combination of Usearch (v 10.0. 240; [14]) and Vsearch (v 2.8. 1; [60]) with a 5 % clustering threshold to obtain a more conservative estimation of the actual number of species.|$|R
