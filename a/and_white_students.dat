5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> was unconstitutional. Although agitation {{for an end to}} racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by {{the leadership of the}} Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E

25|$|Berea College, {{located at}} the extreme {{southern}} edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the South to admit both black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students,</b> doing so from its very establishment in 1855. This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of Berea College v. Kentucky in 1908. This decision effectively segregated Berea until the landmark Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.|$|E
25|$|When the city's Board of Education began {{building}} the John Phillip Sousa Junior High, {{a group of}} parents from the Anacostia neighborhood petitioned to have the school admit black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students.</b> When it was constructed, the board declared that only whites could enroll. The parents sued in a case decided in the landmark Supreme Court ruling Bolling v. Sharpe. Partly due to the District's unique status under the Constitution, the court decided unanimously that all of D.C.'s public schools had to be integrated. In the wake of this and the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, the Eisenhower administration decided to make D.C. schools the first to integrate, as an example {{to the rest of}} the nation.|$|E

25|$|Garnett fell in {{love with}} the sport of {{basketball}} while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina and played on the school's basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students.</b> Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention. Due to the racially charged incident and fearful of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago, for his senior year of high school.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1975, Judge James F. Gordon {{stipulated that}} a {{desegregation}} {{plan would be}} implemented {{at the beginning of}} the 1975–76 school year, to begin September 4, 1975. The school system used mandatory busing to distribute students to integrate the newly merged school systems. The students were bused according to the first initial of their last name and their grade level. The busing was to achieve certain percentages of racial diversity in schools regardless of where the students lived. In practical effects, the plan required black students to be bused up to 10 of their 12 years in school, <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> 2 of their 12 years. In 1978 the judge ended his supervision of the project, but the decree remained in effect in some places. The school system continued the busing system. In the mid-1980s, the school system restructured the plan to try to provide for more local schooling for students. Guidelines remained in effect for percentages of the student population based on ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|The Court went {{even further}} in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in Berea College v. Kentucky (1908), holding {{that the states}} could force private actors to {{discriminate}} by prohibiting colleges from having both black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students.</b> By the early 20th century, the Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed {{to the point that}} Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. dismissed it as [...] "the usual last resort of constitutional arguments." ...|$|E

500|$|As schools {{began to}} integrate, {{students}} and teachers noticed differences in the way Black students <b>and</b> <b>White</b> <b>students</b> signed. Carolyn McCaskill, now professor of ASL and Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University, recalls the challenge of understanding the dialect of ASL used by her White principal and teachers after her segregated school of her youth integrated: [...] "When I began attending the school, I {{did not understand the}} teacher and she did not understand me because we used different signs." [...] Carl Croneberg was the first to discuss differences between BASL and White ASL in his appendices of the 1965 version of the Dictionary of American Sign Language. Work has continued on BASL since then.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of [...] "Acting White" [...] by Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University and Paul Torelli {{suggested}} that the phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels, but might explain {{a significant role in}} the disparities between black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> at high achievement levels. Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, [...] "acting white" [...] prejudices are actually more common the more integrated the school, with historically black schools free of any effects. He found that groups such as Italian immigrants in Boston’s West End and the Maori of New Zealand display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.|$|E
500|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> to be unconstitutional. The decision overturned the [...] Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation, insofar as it applied to public education. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court's unanimous (9–0) decision stated that [...] "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." [...] As a result, de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement, and a model for many future impact litigation cases. However, the decision's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II, [...] only ordered states to desegregate [...] "with all deliberate speed".|$|E

The data are from students and recent graduates of Dartmouth College. The data are consistent with a model in which the expected value of a social interaction with an unknown person is low relative to travel costs and the benefits from interacting with the same person repeatedly are high. First year students interact with whomever is in their immediate proximity and form long term friendships with a subset of those people. Geographic proximity and race are even greater determinants of social interaction than are common interests, majors, or family background. Two randomly chosen <b>white</b> <b>students</b> interact three times more often than do a black <b>student</b> <b>and</b> a <b>white</b> <b>student.</b> However, placing the black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>student</b> in the same freshman dorm increases their frequency of interaction by a factor of three. We show that a traditional "linear in means " model of social interaction can be a good approximation to the actual set of social interactions if researchers condition on key factors like distance, race and age...|$|R
2500|$|However, due to {{the booming}} economy {{of the city in}} the late 1980s and early 1990s, Charlotte {{experienced}} a rapid immigration from the Northeast and the Midwest, which resulted in a decline of the acceptanced of busing. In 1992, in response to these complaints, CMS created a managed choice plan {{to reduce the number of}} students being bused. This new choice plan revolved around magnet schools, making one-third of the schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg either magnets or partial magnets, and each magnet had a quota of black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> that were allowed to attend. [...] But this didn’t please many white families who were denied entrance into magnet schools that had fulfilled their quotas.|$|E

Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began when nine Tougaloo College students {{tried to read}} books in the [...] "white only" [...] public library and were arrested. Founded as a historically black college (HBCU) by the American Missionary Association after the Civil War, Tougaloo College helped organize both black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> of the region to work together for civil rights.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the moral and social justice arguments for closing the achievement gap, there are strong economic arguments for doing so. A 2009 report by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company asserts that {{the persistence of the}} achievement gap in the U.S. has the economic effect of a “permanent national recession." [...] The report claims that if the achievement gap between black and Latino performance <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>student</b> performance had been narrowed, GDP in 2008 would have been $310 billion to $525 billion higher (2-4 percent).|$|R

A week before the referendum, which was scheduled to take place on September 27, Faubus addressed the citizens of Little Rock {{in an attempt to}} secure their votes. Faubus urged the population to vote against integration since he was planning on leasing the public school buildings to private schools, and, in doing so, would educate the white and black students separately.

2500|$|While at the University of Chicago, Sanders {{joined the}} Young People's Socialist League (the youth {{affiliate}} of the Socialist Party of America), and {{was active in}} the Civil Rights Movement as a student organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Under Sanders's chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of SNCC. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. [...] "We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments," [...] Sanders said at the protest. Sanders and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office, performing the first civil rights sit-in in Chicago history. After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. Joan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as [...] "...a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with". Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting against police brutality, only to eventually notice that a Chicago police car was shadowing him and taking them all down.|$|E
