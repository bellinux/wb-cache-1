40|$|Every {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} engineer deals with a never ending story – limitedcomputer resources. In {{computational fluid dynamics}} there is practically never enoughcomputer power. Limited computer resources lead to long calculation times which result inhigh costs {{and one of the}} main reasons is that large quantity of elements are needed in acomputational mesh in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. Although there exist established meshing approaches for the Siemens 4 th generation DLEburner, mesh dependency has not been fully evaluated yet. The main goal of this work istherefore to better optimize accuracy versus cell count for this particular burner intended forsimulation of air/gas mixing where eddy-viscosity based turbulence models are employed. Ansys Fluent solver was used for all simulations in this work. For time effectivisationpurposes a 30 ° sector model of the burner was created and validated for the meshconvergence study. No steady state solutions were found for this case therefore timedependent simulations with time statistics sampling were employed. The mesh convergencestudy has shown that a coarse computational mesh in <b>air</b> <b>casing</b> of the burner does not affectflow conditions downstream where air/gas mixing process is taking place and that a majorpart of the combustion chamber is highly mesh independent. A large reduction of cell count inthose two parts is therefore allowed. On the other hand the RPL (Rich Pilot Lean) and thepilot burner turned out to be highly mesh density dependent. The RPL and the Pilot burnerneed to have significantly more refined mesh as it has been used so far with the establishedmeshing approaches. The mesh optimization has finally shown that at least as accurate resultsof air/gas mixing results may be obtained with 3 x smaller cell count. Furthermore it has beenshown that significantly more accurate results may be obtained with 60 % smaller cell count aswith the established meshing approaches. A short mesh study of the Siemens 3 rd generation DLE burner in ignition stage of operationwas also performed in this work. This brief study has shown that the established meshingapproach for air/gas mixing purposes is sufficient for use with Ansys Fluent solver whilecertain differences were discovered when comparing the results obtained with Ansys Fluentagainst those obtained with Ansys CFX solver. Differences between Fluent and CFX solverwere briefly discussed in this work as identical simulation set up in both solvers producedslightly different results. Furthermore the obtained results suggest that Fluent solver is lessmesh dependent as CFX solver for this particular case...|$|E

40|$|Permeable Friction Courses (PFC) are open-graded {{bituminous}} mixtures {{placed over}} an impervious base. The interconnected air voids allow rainwater to drain into the pavement thus providing a safer driving surface in wet weather {{and a filter}} for highway runoff. This report summarizes {{the current state of}} the practice related to the hydraulic properties, water quality benefits, and maintenance of PFC based on literature from around the world. Porous pavements reduce pollutant concentrations in the highway runoff during the functional service life of the pavement, which ultimately results in the clogging of the pavement. This material accumulating in the pores was found to have high concentrations of pollutants, such as heavy metals. Pavement cleaning machines used in Europe to remove accumulated pollutants are described and usually found to maintain the function of the pavements. Existing research also includes measurements of hydraulic conductivity over time and from different pavements. In winter conditions, more maintenance is required for PFCs than for conventional pavements since the air voids change with ambient <b>air</b> temperature <b>casing</b> the PFC to freeze faster than conventional pavement.

40|$|The single screw {{compressor}} {{is used in}} many fields such as air compression, chemical industry and refrigeration. During operation, different gas pressures and temperatures applied on the components can cause different degrees of deformation, {{which leads to a}} difference between the thermally induced clearance and the designed clearance.

In this paper, a temperature measurement instrument and a convective heat transfer model were described and used to establish the temperature of a single screw <b>air</b> compressor’s <b>casing,</b> screw rotor and star wheel. 3 -D models of these three main components were built. The gas force deformation, thermal-structure deformation and thermal-force coupling deformation were carried out by using a finite element simulation method. Results show that the clearance between the bottom of the groove and the top of star wheel is reduced by 0. 066 mm, the clearance between the side of groove and the star wheel is reduced by 0. 015 mm, and the clearance between the cylinder and the rotor is reduced by 0. 01 mm. It is suggested that these deformations should be taken into account during the design of these clearances...|$|R

Engines fuel consumption was significantly reduced by using Zeolites, those are 11. 2 % (laboratory petrol engine), 17 % (motorcycles), and 23 % (carburator car). It is still required to observe this success on EFI car. Experiments was performed at stasionary and mobile experiments. Stasionary experiments was performed at 1000, 2000, and 3000 rpm for 20 minutes, whereas mobile experiments was performed at avarage engine speed of 60 kph for 20 km, and acceleration of 0 - 100 kph.

30|$|The air {{injection}} connector system {{is also known}} as parasitic pipe joints. In the past, underbalanced drilling was usually realized by the principle of the “U-tube”, which means another injection well must be made first to form a “U-tube” with the production well to inject high-pressure air when the production well is being drilled. In order to reduce the budget of drilling and to eliminate hazards with few engineering work, the injection well was replaced by the {{air injection}} connector system, which is connected on the production casing at a predetermined position down {{into the bottom of the}} well with the casing. It will then open a valve to inject <b>air</b> into the <b>casing</b> ring space during drilling to realize underbalanced drilling (Xian et al. 2009). In order to meet the technical requirements of the above process, the air injection connector system must consist of a non-return valve to eliminate backflow. It must be sent downhole together with the casing and be cemented disposable with the casing. After completion of the first phase of drilling process, the air injection connector could be used to inject high-pressure air in the next phase of drilling process. The pressurized air mixed with the drilling mud would help to increase the performance of underbalanced drilling (Fried et al. 1996; Bennion et al. 1998; Misselbrook et al. 1991; Oyatomari et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|The Transient Heat Transfer Facility (THTF) was {{developed}} at the University of Oxford to test full-scale high pressure compressor and turbine <b>casing</b> <b>air</b> systems using gas turbine engine representative secondary air system mass flow rates, total temperatures and total pressures. Transient casing response together with blade and disc responses governs achievable tip clearances in both compressors and turbines. Traditionally, casing thermal response is faster than disc response and so requires cooling. However, future engine designs may have thermal responses of the discs that are faster than the casings. In this paper we investigate the use of air impingement {{as a means to}} speed up the casing response to match such future designs. Two different impingement configurations were selected from a total of eight designs based on steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions of maximum heat transfer coefficient (HTC). The 3 D thermal growth of the casing was characterised by the surface temperature rise over a given period of time to assess achievable dynamic response. The configurations were tested in the THTF as a rainbow set. The resulting casing metal temperatures were used in conjunction with an explicit solution of the conduction in the casing wall to calculate HTC due to impingement. The experimental set-up resembles a typical aircraft engine and therefore includes measurement uncertainties arising from features such as fixtures, seals, geometries and large surface areas that are then subjected to varying thermal inertias. These can lead to circumferential temperature non-uniformities, as evident from the experimental results. An uncertainty analysis was performed to quantify these effects on the overall casing thermal response. The experimental data was then compared against numerical predictions from an axisymmetric, 90 ° sector, conjugate heat transfer model of the facility using the two impingement plate designs. Overall, the values of HTC agreed well across the experimental and numerical results. Both approaches predicted differences in which of the two designs was more effective; however, advantages and limitations were identified in both approaches. The combined experimental and numerical study shows the significance of analysing the full annulus, at engine representative conditions and the benefit of an impingement array to potentially speed up casing response for future engines...|$|R
40|$|Micro-hydropower plants (MHP) {{give the}} best {{solution}} to the power needs of rural and small communities which serve as decentralized power source to meet the local population requirement. Energy requirements for lighting, cooking, heating, drying, agro-processing and other small scale industrial activities can be met through these MHPs in the most reliable way {{in the rural areas}} of the country like Nepal. Cross- flow turbines are used widely in such MHPs due to their simple design, easier maintenance, low initial investment and modest efficiency. Also, because of their suitability under low heads, their efficient operation under a wide range of flow variations and ease of fabrication, cross- flow turbines have been extensively employed. 	The research work comprises of both experimental studies and numerical investigation of the cross- flow turbine. Experiments are conducted in dedicated test rig available in Fluid Engineering Laboratory of Korea Maritime and Ocean University (KMOU). With robust computer technologies and design developments, a CFD based study on the design, performance characteristics, flow analyses and design optimization are carried out in this study work. A previously made test rig (Hyosung Ebara Engineering Company, South Korea, 2009) was reviewed and maintained to conduct the experiments. 	During the experiment, pump provides the required head and the flow through the turbine. Electro-magnetic flow meter and pressure transducer at the upstream side are used for the flow rate and pressure measurement respectively. The turbine was coupled to powder brake through torque meter and the required parameters were recorded in the data logger. Experiments were conducted at various rpm and flow rates. For numerical simulation, two phase (air & water at 25 째C) steady state with SST turbulence model was selected in the commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX 13. 0. The design parameters include 10 m head, 0. 1 m 3 /s flow rate and 642 rotational speed. Numerical results obtained from the simulation were compared with the experimental results. Several major parameters that affect the cross-flow turbine efficiency were studied and design modifications were done to enhance the turbine performance. 	In order to enhance the efficiency of the turbine, various design modifications have been proposed and evaluated numerically. Nozzle shape modification, guide vane angle variation, blade numbers variation, <b>air</b> layer insertion, <b>casing</b> length and diffuse angle variation were done simultaneously during the process and finally the optimized design was proposed. Velocity distribution, pressure contours, output torque etc. in the flow domain and the several stages of flow inside the runner were also characterized.
