5|$|In 2006, Bana {{was invited}} to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Lucky You, a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming Munich, was {{released}} in early 2007. In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional poker player who must overcome his personal problems to win <b>a</b> <b>high-stakes</b> tournament in Las Vegas. His next film was the Australian drama Romulus, My Father (2007). The film, based on Raimond Gaita's memoir of the same name, portrays a couple and their struggle in the face of adversity to raise their son. The film was a critical success, and Bana's performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor. In 2007, he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy Kath & Kim as himself.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The film's plot sees Bond becoming involved in an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in <b>a</b> <b>high-stakes</b> poker game, after foiling an attack he arranged on a new aircraft being demonstrated at Miami International Airport; during the course of his assignment, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film is part of a story arc that continues in Quantum of Solace (2008), with explicit references to the characters and events being made in films set after the story, within Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy surrounded Craig when he was selected to succeed Pierce Brosnan in October 2005. Location filming took place in the Czech Republic, the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at Barrandov Studios and Pinewood Studios; although part of the storyline is set in Montenegro, no filming took place there.|$|E

In addition, climate change is also <b>a</b> <b>high-stake</b> issue, affecting <b>a</b> range of sectors and policy domains.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{this paper}} was written without any {{intention}} to propose that only reading should be assessed for university entrance examinations in Japan. Such a practice will naturally lead English classes to heavily focus on reading only, possibly via the Grammar Translation Method. In order to foster communicative skills in a balanced manner among students, including productive skills, tasks in which students utilize all four skills should be implemented. For that sake, the washback effect imposed by such <b>a</b> <b>high-stake</b> test as NCT is useful, if not indispensable. It is sincerely hoped that, through implementing the system to require all students to take the tests of four skills for university entrance examination, English education in Japan will cultivate all four skills among students more than ever.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of a change {{introduced}} at <b>a</b> <b>high-stake</b> language exam in Hungary, following a paradigm shift concerning a test task eliciting an individual long turn from candidates. Originally, this task required test takers to produce a long turn and then to participate in interaction within the same task. Now, the task aims to assess production only, with awarding lower test scores concerning two components, namely Communicative value and Discourse management, of the rating scale if interaction is to take place. The findings contradict well-established results of the fluency-accuracy continuum research. What is more, significant changes in test scores can only be observed at the components in which no changes were made. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|R
25|$|The Oklahoma and Florida Seminole filed land claim {{suits in}} the 1950s, which were {{combined}} in the government's settlement of 1976.

30|$|For the {{following}} depiction, {{it is important}} to bear {{the following}} in mind. Many students who are assessed in low-stakes studies respond in a largely sloppy style. Such improper language entails severe difficulties for natural language processing (NLP). This is why we stick to rather coarse-grained methodological approaches, such as stemming—cutting of affixes instead of resolving the actual word stem—or the bag of words—a paradigm investigating words as separate units and, thus, neglecting word order and syntax. <b>As</b> <b>high-stakes</b> assessments bring about language in responses that complies more to the standard, more sophisticated NLP technologies can be used there. But the employed operationalizations in the present study needed to tolerate language deviating from the standard regularly. Hence, they are regarded as approximations of the indicators described in the theoretical framework.|$|R

Instead, Stanford invited the winners of the World Twenty20, India, to play for a prize of US$5 million (later US$10 million) and planned to ask Australia to come as a back-up should India decline or be unavailable. India, who were in the process of launching the highly successful first year of their domestic Twenty20 league, the Indian Premier League, declined as they did not want to be involved in a privately funded programme.|$|E

This effect appears not to bedriven by i) differences in observable characteristics; ii) differences in real estate agents’behavior; or iii) institutional characteristics of the market.
