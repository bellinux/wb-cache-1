25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Girl</b> Like You Doing in a Place Like This? A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Girl</b> Like You Doing in a Place Like This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{itself was}} written by Andrew Bergman, who also directed. According to one critic, the novel's plot is [...] "quite faithfully followed" [...] by the screenplay, but in bringing the complicated story to the screen, [...] "Bergman forgets to explain persuasively what <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>girl</b> like Erin — smart, spunky and a former FBI employee — is doing in a dump called the Eager Beaver." ...|$|E

Lenalee {{was one of the first}} characters created for the series, most notably, before Allen Walker. Hoshino based Lenalee on a real person, but has only shared her identity with her editor who laughed at the revelation. Hoshino considers her to be an ideal girl. Her exorcist uniform was remade many times until the author was satisfied with it. Lenalee was originally going to be portrayed as crabby and fiery based on her dark backstory, but ended up as <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Cardinale {{appeared}} in a Philippe Adrien stage production of Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth, and in the 2006/2007 season also featured in another Williams play, The Glass Menagerie, directed by Andrea Liberovici, in which she played the character of Amanda. In 2007, Cardinale {{appeared in}} the Aline Issermann comedy film Cherche fiancé tous frais payés, opposite Alexandra Lamy and Bruno Salomone, in a role which Patrick Besson described as [...] "atrocious". After {{a role in the}} TV movie Hold-up à l'italienne (2008), the following year Cardinale starred in the critically acclaimed The String, playing a Tunisian mother who has a tempestuous relationship with her French-educated gay son. Michael D. Klemm of cinemaqueer.com reflected on how the film broke many of the taboos with interracial sexuality and homosexuality. He praised Cardinale's [...] "terrific" [...] acting and portrayal of the [...] "overbearing" [...] mother, likening one scene, where she [...] "brings home <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>girl</b> for Malik (Antonin Stahly) to meet", to Harold and Maude (1971). In 2010, Cardinale received the Golden Orange Best Actress Award at the 47th Antalya [...] "Golden Orange" [...] International Film Festival for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in Signora Enrica.

2500|$|Ferris gave {{a number}} of well-regarded performances, {{but she did not}} become a big star. Equally, {{although}} ostensibly she fitted the stereotypical image of a mid-1960s blonde, she was never really a [...] "starlet", a characteristic she shared with, among other actresses of a similar mould, Julie Christie and Carol White. For a while, after Catch Us If You Can, she acquired a certain [...] "pin-up" [...] status [...] The New York Times review of <b>A</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Girl</b> Like You by Roger Greenspun contained a vignette of Ferris in the late 1960s:"Barbara Ferris is a strong-featured girl with an odd facial resemblance to Noël Coward. Despite her winsome smile, flaxen hair and peaches-and-cream complexion, she plays innocence {{as if it were an}} allegory of experience and lines of calculation enmesh the cornflowers." ...|$|E
