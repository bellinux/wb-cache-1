50|$|The most {{effective}} methods are to employ <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> circuitry including arc suppressors, solid state relays, hybrid power relays, mercury displacement relays and hybrid power contactors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>suppression</b> {{is an area}} of {{interest}} in engineering because of the destructive effects of the electrical arc to electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors’ points of contact.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>suppression</b> is the {{reduction}} of sparks formed when current-carrying contacts are separated. The spark is a luminous discharge of highly energized electrons and ions, and is an electric arc.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{contactors}} utilize {{vacuum bottle}} encapsulated contacts {{to suppress the}} arc. This <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> allows the contacts to be much smaller and use less space than air break contacts at higher currents. As the contacts are encapsulated, vacuum contactors are used fairly extensively in dirty applications, such as mining.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawn arc}} can be {{initiated}} by two electrodes initially in contact and drawn apart; this can initiate an arc without the high-voltage glow discharge. This {{is the way}} a welder starts to weld a joint, momentarily touching the welding electrode against the workpiece then withdrawing it till a stable arc is formed. Another example is separation of electrical contacts in switches, relays or circuit breakers; in high-energy circuits <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> {{may be required to}} prevent damage to contacts.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts {{must have some}} form of <b>arc</b> <b>suppression.</b> Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each relay contact was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but {{there was a lot of}} attenuation.|$|E
50|$|Since the arc {{is entirely}} {{contained}} within the interrupter, switch-gear using vacuum interrupters can be very compact compared with switch-gear using air or oil as the <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> medium. New metal-clad medium-voltage switch-gear now predominantly uses vacuum interrupters, and vacuum interrupter retrofits for air circuit breaker switch-gear are available. Vacuum interrupters {{can be used for}} circuit breakers and load switches. Circuit breaker vacuum interrupters are mainly used in the power sector in the substation and power grid facilities, while load switching vacuum interrupter is mainly used for power grid of the end user.|$|E
50|$|When {{the power}} being {{switched}} is sufficiently large, the electron flow across opening switch contacts {{is sufficient to}} ionize the air molecules across the tiny gap between the contacts as the switch is opened, forming a gas plasma, also known as an electric arc. The plasma is of low resistance {{and is able to}} sustain power flow, even with the separation distance between the switch contacts steadily increasing. The plasma is also very hot and is capable of eroding the metal surfaces of the switch contacts. Electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts and also significant electromagnetic interference (EMI), requiring the use of <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> methods.|$|E
5000|$|DC {{switch gear}} is {{larger and more}} {{expensive}} to produce, since <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> is more difficult. When a switch or fuse first opens, current will continue to flow in an arc across the contacts. Once the contacts get far enough apart, the arc will extinguish because the electric field strength (volts per meter) is insufficient to sustain it. In AC circuits, current drops to zero twice during each AC cycle, at which time the arc extinguishes. If {{the distance between the}} contacts is still relatively small, the voltage will re-initiate an arc. Since DC is constant and these zero-crossing events do not occur, a DC switch must be designed to interrupt the full rated voltage and current, leading to larger and more expensive switching equipment. [...] The voltage required to re-initiate an extinguished arc is much greater than the voltage required to sustain an arc.|$|E
50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also <b>arc</b> <b>suppression).</b>|$|E
40|$|According to the {{shortcoming}} of single-phase {{ground fault}} line selection method in the resonant grounded system {{such as the}} uncertainty of its device by fast compensation with the automatic compensation equipment, an <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> and residual flow incremental method is proposed to effectively choose the earth fault line. Firstly, when the single-phase ground fault occurs, the <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil parameters are adjusted to realize compensation and <b>arc</b> <b>suppression.</b> Then the <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil inductance values are modulated to make the zero-sequence current of fault line changed, at the same time, the zero-sequence current value is detected and its change will be captured to select the fault line.

40|$|In this article, we {{describe}} a possibility to quench Partial Discharges (PD) in medium voltage networks by using Residual Current Compensation (RCC) device (Swedish Neutral), proposed by K. Winter.

40|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coils {{provide a}} low cost method of {{increasing}} both {{the reliability and}} safety of high voltage transmission and distribution systems. Although the concept is not new, the advent of modern control equipment allows fresh opportunities {{for them to be}} used to save lives and to decrease the cost and inconvenience to industry and the community in general that is caused by electricity supply interruptions without incurring large expenditure. Earth fault currents are reduced to almost zero, thus eliminating many short time power supply interruptions and preventing damage to the electricity supply system {{at the time of the}} initial fault. Because of the reduction in damage at the time of the fault, many longer duration interruptions are avoided. It is common for live high voltage conductors to be close to the ground and for the fault not to be detected by conventional power system protection equipment. <b>Arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil systems can detect high impedance earth faults and broken conductors which cannot be detected by conventional protection systems. There are many system abnormalities which can cause neutral voltages in <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil systems. The appropriate action to be taken by the protection system depends on the type of system abnormality. The causes of neutral voltages in <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Fully computerised power system protection systems are now being implemented. These modern protection systems will be able to utilise the criteria developed in this research to take immediate appropriate action based on the neutral voltage caused by the system abnormality. In existing distribution systems there is a widespread use of two single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in open-delta configuration to provide economic in-line three phase voltage regulation. An original method of representing open delta regulators in symmetrical component analyses is developed. It is shown that when open-delta regulators are used in a power system equipped with an <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil very high voltages can occur. A solution is proposed whereby three single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in a closed-delta arrangement are used. One of the potential problems with these systems is cross country faults caused by the neutral voltage displacement combined with the transient voltages at the time of the initial earth fault. These transient over-voltages are analysed in detail and a method of testing the capability of existing system components to withstand the over-voltages is developed. Simple methods to estimate the transient voltages on overhead power systems are derived. A new method of minimising the transient over-voltages is proposed. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{grounding}} {{method used}} in the distribution system is a solid grounding. This is a common grounding mode used in most distribution system of Korea. If the resistance or <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coil grounding are used, the fault cannot be detected by current amplitude change because the fault current depends on the resistance or coil values. Therefore, the proposed algorithm cannot be applied.|$|E
40|$|DC and {{so-called}} quasi dc reactive sputtering of dielectrics have advanced rapidly {{during the past}} several years. Keys to much of the advance have been active feedback control of partial pressure, new <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> systems, and use of auxiliary plasmas to increase deposition rates. In this paper we describe a high rate system, MicroDyn®, incorporating all of these features. The MicroDyn ® process was originally developed for use in rotating drum batch coaters in which deposition of each layer can be accomplished by multiple passes under a target. Specifically, the process has been very successfully used to batch deposit hot mirror coatings on halogen lamps for energy savings. Recently, it has also been successfully applied to in-line and roll-coaters where relatively thick layers must be deposited in a single pass under a target. Deposition rates of several materials, including arcing prone materials such as SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, are several times faster than those achieved by conventional sputtering processes. The microwave auxiliary plasma system used in MicroDyn ® will be broadly described, as will the <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> systems used...|$|E

40|$|The {{tightening}} of {{requirements for the}} distribution networks’ quality of supply obliges distribution system operators to make large investments in distribution networks. Medium voltage network cabling is one prominent method to improve the reliability of delivery. However, the cable characteristics {{are different from the}} characteristics of an overhead line. An underground cable produces significant amount of both reactive power and earth fault current. In order to keep the touch voltages in acceptable limits during an earth fault, in addition to centralized coils also distributed <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coils are being increasingly used. Transferring reactive power causes losses and major cost are caused by the Fingrid’s fee for inputting reactive power in main grid. The reactive power is being compensated by shunt reactors. The objective of this thesis was to find the development needs to ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 software in the aspect of medium voltage network cabling. Representatives of 4 distribution system operators were interviewed and both measurements and simulations were performed to find the needs for improvements. Also the feasibility of active voltage level management feature Volt-VAr Control for Finnish customers was discussed. As an outcome of this thesis, several development needs were gathered. New devices such as shunt reactors and Dyn 11 +YN transformers need to be accurately modelled to enhance load flow calculation and to ease the network coding. The earth fault analysis method of present DMS 600 version includes multiple simplifications that may cause inaccuracies in networks containing long cable feeders and multiple <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coils. More accurate earth fault calculation method was presented to improve the accuracy of the earth fault analysis method. Needs for features and notices to support the distribution system operators in the planning and operation of distribution network consisting of distributed compensation coils were presented. For example visualizing the compensation degree of feeders could help the planning and operation of feeders containing distributed <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> coils. Also the analysing of multiple network plans that are in the area of same HV-MV substation should be possible. That way the growth of reactive power and earth fault current could be taken into consideration during network planning.
