The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they look for answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the series famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.|$|E

500|$|After the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, there was academic discourse {{on the effect of}} section8B(1) on the future development of the common law. The amendments merely caused <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> in the common law, taking it back to 1971. As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review, there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng. Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change.

500|$|Much {{criticism}} was leveled against the ambiguous ending. Tim Roth, who portrayed General Thade, said [...] "I cannot explain that ending.

It's all <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> thing. He's gone back and he realizes Thade's beat him there." [...] Although the ending was ambiguous, it was closer to {{the ending of the}} actual Pierre Boulle book than was the ending of the 1968 Charlton Heston movie version. In the first of two twist endings of the Pierre Boulle book, the astronaut escapes back to planet Earth, only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip. Burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense, but {{it was more of a}} cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel. [...] "It was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case Fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie," [...] he explained.|$|E
