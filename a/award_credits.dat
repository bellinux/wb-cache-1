5000|$|Also called [...] "LS", {{players are}} lumped into one team (which {{can go up}} to 8), and they fight {{together}} to destroy large numbers of computer-controlled drone mechanaughts. The drones appear in 2 large groups, at one location near the allied aerogates. The allies' objective is to defend the aerogates against these assaults.

This panorama has generated considerable debate about their effectiveness in terms of learning, sustainability and especially the role that higher education institutions play in this context. We understand that students are involved on formal and informal learning activities, and require universities should have new model to recognize their skills and abilities on these scenarios. One case study is the MOOC learning framework, where universities are interested but there are nowadays some doubts and fears about the official recognition as a usual learning activity. In this article we analyse some data from the activity in an Open Course developed in the University of Granada and the implications regarding learning skills and recognition.

40|$|This {{publication}} saw life initially as {{a report}} on continuing professional development (CPD) to the Chief Medical Officer. It gives the background {{to the nature of}} CPD, its prevalence, types, aims, the educational approaches, and the factors that influence its provision and the participation in CPD programmes. The next section deals with the methodological issues. These include the design of programmes and the assessment of outcomes. The main part of the report is devoted to {{a review of the literature}} up to 1997. There is recognition of the importance, reflected in its prevalence, of self directed learning and of how individuals will largely initiate, control, and evaluate their own continuous learning. This is a difficulty for professional bodies who <b>award</b> <b>credits</b> for more formal learning experiences. The assessment of outcomes is very difficult and falls far short of being able to measure health care benefits, which is what government wants for its financial investment in CPD. There is also no best learning method. The authors conclude that the effectiveness of CPD is a function of the process and the context in which it occurs. Horses for courses!
