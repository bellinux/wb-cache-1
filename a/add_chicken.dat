50|$|A unique {{aspect of}} Rip's {{is the fact}} there is no {{tangible}} menu. The menu is given {{by word of mouth}} to the customers as they are waiting in line. This particular type of menu makes the ordering process simple; Bill Rounds, a current co-owner, asks each customer waiting in line if he or she would like to order a quarter light or a quarter dark. Depending on the day, he could also <b>add</b> <b>chicken</b> strips or fish to this question. The informal nature of the ordering process distinguishes Rip's from other taverns. Once seated, customers receive crispys and pickles, Rip's signature appetizers. Crispys are the spare batter pieces dropped from the chicken during the frying process.|$|E

40|$|Biscuits are {{convenient}} and inexpensive food {{products that are}} becoming very popular in India. The present {{study was conducted to}} standardize and evaluate the physical, textural and organoleptic properties of chicken biscuits by using defatted chicken, maida flour, spices, butter and baking agents. Control was prepared without <b>adding</b> <b>chicken.</b> Chicken biscuits were prepared by adding 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 % of defatted chicken into flour with other ingredients. The physical, textural and organoleptic properties of the chicken biscuits were carried out. The results of Hunter’s Lab colour analysis showed that addition of chicken in the biscuits at 5 – 25 % levels resulted in increase of the whiteness, and decrease in yellowness whereas control biscuits had high in redness. The texture analysis showed that breaking strength decreased with incorporation of chicken at 5 % to 20 % level. Nine-point hedonic scale ranking method was used to evaluate the organoleptic characteristics of prepared biscuits. The 5 % defatted <b>chicken</b> <b>added</b> biscuits were well accepted by sensory panelist. Thus it can be concluded that biscuits can be made with substitution of defatted chicken up to 5 % without adversely affecting the sensory characteristic of biscuit...|$|R

40|$|Yield of Taro is very {{variable}} by the unknowing of its genotype {{characteristics and}} by differences of planting practices, mainly {{about the use}} of organic residues as covering or incorporated to the soil. The aim of this work was to analyze the productivity, gross income and bromatological composition of ‘Chinês’ and ‘Macaquinho’ taro, cultivated with different forms of <b>adding</b> semi-decomposed <b>chicken</b> manure to the soil (soil without chicken manure; with chicken manure as covering; with chicken manure incorporated to the soil and with chicken manure as covering + incorporated to the soil). Treatments were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Two harvests were performed at 183 and 211 days after transplanting. There was no difference for most of the characteristics evaluated under addiction of chicken manure. Yields of commercial cormels from Macaquinho were higher than Chinês, which can be seen as positive feature for higher gross income. Plants of ‘Macaquinho’ taro were precocious and more productive than ‘Chinês’ taro. To obtain higher gross income, ‘Macaquinho’ taro must be cultivated with <b>adding</b> <b>chicken</b> manure to the soil as covering (5 t ha- 1) + incorporated to the soil (5 t ha- 1) and harvested 183 days after planting. Bromatological analysis showed that corms and cormels of ‘Chinês’ taro were more nutritious than ‘Macaquinho’ taro when grown without chicken manure. ...|$|R

50|$|William Harvey (1578-1657) was {{an early}} proponent of all life {{beginning}} from an egg, omne vivum ex ovo.Francesco Redi, an Italian physician, proved as early as 1668 that higher forms of life did not originate spontaneously by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies. but proponents of spontaneous generation claimed that this {{did not apply to}} microbes and continued to hold that these could arise spontaneously. Attempts to disprove the spontaneous generation of life from non-life continued in the early 19th century with observations and experiments by Franz Schulze and Theodor Schwann.In 1745, John Needham <b>added</b> <b>chicken</b> broth to a flask and boiled it. He then let it cool and waited. Microbes grew, and he proposed it as an example of spontaneous generation. In 1768, Lazzaro Spallanzani repeated Needham's experiment but removed all the air from the flask. No growth occurred. In 1854, Heinrich G. F. Schröder (1810-1885) and Theodor von Dusch, and in 1859, Schröder alone, repeated the Helmholtz filtration experiment and showed that living particles can be removed from air by filtering it through cotton-wool.|$|R

They branched into full meals after Swanson executive Gerry Thomas visited the distributor {{of a company that}} specialized in preparing food for airlines. The company packed the food in aluminum trays which could be heated in a convection oven. Thomas proposed this idea to the Swanson brothers, suggesting they create an aluminum tray with three compartments: one compartment for frozen turkey slices and the other two for side dishes.

40|$|Anaerobic {{fermentation}} is {{a highly}} promising technology for converting biomass waste into methane, which then may directly {{be used as an}} energy source. Attempts have been made to optimize various parameters {{in order to determine the}} most favorable recipe for maximum biogas production from fermented vegetable waste. The biogas production from many types of vegetable waste such as zucchini, orange peel, tomato, potato, and rice was studied in batch digesters. The effect of <b>adding</b> <b>chicken</b> dung and sludge to vegetable waste on the concentration of methane in the produced biogas was investigated. The experiments were conducted at room temperature (20 °C) and at 35 °C. The results revealed that methane concentration goes through maximum value with time. This maximum value is obtained faster when the rate of digestion is faster. The concentrations of methane in the biogas produced are ranked as follows: potato>rice>tomato>zucchini>orange peels. The concentrations of methane gas increased as chicken dung and sludge were mixed with the vegetables. The maximum value of methane concentration is reached faster in a mixture of chicken dung and sludge. For both chicken dung and sludge, the maximum value is reached at the same time...|$|R

To characterize the genome of CAV, we cloned linearized CAV DNA into the vector pIC 20 H. Transfection of the circularized cloned insert into chicken cell lines caused a cytopathogenic effect, which was arrested when a chicken serum with neutralizing antibodies directed against CAV was <b>added.</b> <b>Chickens</b> inoculated at 1 day of age with CAV collected from cell lines transfected with cloned CAV DNA developed clinical signs of CAV.

The CAV genome probably contains only one promoter region and only one poly(A) addition signal. Southern blot analysis using oligomers derived from the CAV DNA sequence showed that infected cells contained double- and single-stranded CAV DNAs, whereas purified virus contained only the minus strand.
