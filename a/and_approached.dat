5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Kraków, Poland, {{over the course of}} 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> it as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.|$|E
5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a flight test program to determine the effects on landings of wide variations in <b>approach</b> path angle <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> airspeed for different kinds of piloting technique. Over 400 landings were made at approach speeds from 60 to 120 mph <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angles from 3 to 18 deg. Several variations of pilot technique involving different operations of the throttle/spoiler control were investigated. It is shown that very large ranges of airspeed <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angle can be accommodated with rather moderate penalties in landing distance and difficulty. With the spoiler-equipped aircraft, the best approach speeds are considerably higher than would be usable without spoilers, <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angles can be used which are far beyond those normally possible without spoilers...|$|R
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> Dilip Kumar. After {{watching}} the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
5|$|By 1983 {{the museum}} was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> {{engineering}} firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were {{opened to the public}} as a branch of the museum.|$|E
5|$|Crawford wanted {{additional}} work, <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> Loews Theaters publicist Nils Granlund. Granlund {{secured a}} position for her with singer Harry Richman's act {{and arranged for}} her to do a screen test which he sent to producer Harry Rapf in Hollywood. Stories have persisted that Crawford further supplemented her income by appearing in one or more stag, or soft-core pornographic, films, although this has been disputed.|$|E

5|$|Harsha Vardhan was {{selected}} in late April 2013 {{to write the}} film's dialogues, in consideration of his work in Gunde Jaari Gallanthayyinde (2013). Since the film was a period drama, Nagarjuna wanted an experienced veteran cinematographer, <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> P. C. Sreeram. As Sreeram was busy with I (2015), P. S. Vinod was finalised as the cinematographer, marking his return to Telugu cinema after Panjaa (2011). Chennai-based costume designer Nalini Sriram, who worked for Ye Maaya Chesave, {{was selected}} as the film's costume designer. While all the artists had to give their inputs for the costumes, Nageswara Rao gave her full freedom to design the film's costumes.|$|E
5|$|IDW Publishing {{released}} a four-issue prequel written by Chuck Dixon. Each issue focuses on Duke, Destro, The Baroness and Snake Eyes respectively. It began publication in March 2009.

5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This {{met with a}} stiff refusal, as {{it seemed that the}} two were about to win the {{elections}} with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the left-wing credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his Royal Prerogative and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).|$|E

Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa {{turned toward the}} southeastern African coastline <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> the eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as a weakened system.

5|$|The British 3rd Division {{brushed aside}} 16th Luftwaffe <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> the {{outskirts}} of Caen from the north-east. At 19:15, Meyer and Eberbach authorised {{the withdrawal of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen. In the early evening, the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers. The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|The master founder {{initially}} {{tried to}} sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of Babylon itself'. Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at Edirne, from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople. In the meantime, Orban also produced other cannons instrumental for the Turkish siege forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture <b>and</b> <b>approached</b> several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.|$|E
