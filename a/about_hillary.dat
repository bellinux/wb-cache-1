5000|$|As {{it turned}} out, Carrie Marlers {{problems}} {{were due to}} her having a multiple personality disorder. As one of the split personalities known as Carrie Anderson (or Carrie #2 for short), Carrie seduced Josh Lewis into her bed, seduced the next door neighbor boy, Ron Kennedy to lose his virginity to her, and also put herself in bed with Justin (which both Jackie and Ross both found out about) and Carrie #2 falsely accused Justin and herself of having an affair. Carrie #1 or the original personality, Carrie Todd Marler came to, she was very confused and outraged at Ross accusations. Things came to ahead in May 1982, when Carrie #2 came to Joshs office and screnamed hysterically, at Josh that he had promised to marry her once she divorced Ross. Derek Colby overheard this, and Carrie #2 came out and kissed Derek on the cheek (which totally embarrassed Derek, especially when Ross showed up and Carrie #2 ran off; Derek had apparently felt slightly guilty about this kiss when he confronted <b>Hillary</b> <b>about</b> the letter supposedly from [...] "Nola" [...] <b>about</b> <b>Hillarys</b> [...] "affair" [...] with Tony Reardon). Josh would also have an affair with Morgan Nelson, whose modeling career Josh was funding, which would later lead to the break-up of Morgan and Kellys marriage. Later in the month, Carrie #2 would attempt to kill Ross {{with a pair of}} sewing scissors, but luckily before Carrie #2 could do so, Carrie #1 came to, and Ross got her to go to Dr. Sara McIntyre for treatment. Unfortunately, Sara didnt know if she had enough resources to make Carrie whole, but did get a third personality, Carrie McKenzie (or Carrie #3) a childlike personality, to give her strength to Carrie #1 to help her heal, and then Carrie was sent off to England for treatment with a specialist. Carrie also called Jackie, to apologize, before she left (Jackie had gone off to stay with her father in May 1982, after [...] "discovering" [...] the [...] "affair" [...] between Justin and Carrie), and Jackie began making her way home to Justin, Phillip and their recently born (also September 1981) daughter, Samantha Marler, but Jackie would be killed in a plane crash before she could make it home.|$|R
