40|$|In {{most of the}} {{previous}} works on hand-based recognition methods, mostly, the significance was not given to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hand, which {{is used in the}} model. The palm <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hand is generally used because, it is very easy to capture using a simple scanning device and we can extract the shape based features as well as the palm print from the same image. Dorsum of hand (backside of hand or topside of hand) is the <b>apposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the palm <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hand. In this work, we highlight some of the advantages of using dorsum of hand for modeling a biometrics based human recognition system. Segmenting the hand image is the most important step in any hand geometry based recognition systems. We realized that the segmentation algorithm used for segmenting the palm <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hand will not be suitable for segmenting the dorsum of hand. In this paper, we address a simple and fast method for segmenting the dorsum of hand image. The proposed method can be used in hand geometry based recognition algorithms which use the dorsum of hand as the input...|$|R

5000|$|The {{long-lived}} strip {{was drawn}} by Jo Fischer, Chicago artist and cartoonist for almost 60 years. [...] "He was {{the brother of}} Chicago journalists Leo and Maurice ``Ritz`` Fischer, and in 1963 was awarded along with them [...] "Press Vet of the Year" [...] honors by the Chicago Press Veterans Association." [...] Fischer included the names of fans and correspondents in a [...] "From 9 To 5 Club" [...] in signs on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>desks</b> and regularly thanked contributors by name and location for gag ideas in the panel margins.|$|R

25|$|An {{ergonomic}} {{feature of}} the Wang PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk</b> and held the rather large computer box.

60|$|Mr. Harvey did {{not pursue}} the subject.

50|$|A bureau à gradin is {{an antique}} desk form {{resembling}} a writing table with, in addition, one or several tiers of small drawers and pigeonholes built {{on part of}} the desktop surface. Usually the drawers and pigeonholes directly face the user, {{but they can also}} surround three <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk,</b> as is the case for the Carlton house desk form. A small, portable version is a bonheur du jour.|$|R
50|$|A {{rolltop desk}} is a 19th-century {{reworking}} <b>of</b> the pedestal <b>desk</b> with, in addition, {{a series of}} stacked compartments, shelves, drawers and nooks {{in front of the}} user, much like the bureau à gradin or the Carlton House desk. In contrast to these the compartments and the desktop surface <b>of</b> a rolltop <b>desk</b> can be covered by means of a tambour consisting of linked wooden slats that roll or slide through slots in the raised <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk.</b> In that, it is a descendant in function, and partly in form, <b>of</b> the cylinder <b>desk</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century. It is a relative <b>of</b> the tambour <b>desk</b> whose slats retract horizontally rather than vertically.|$|R

5000|$|We kid you {{not at all}} — {{really good}} science fiction is, from the {{editorial}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk,</b> {{harder to come by}} than perfect diamonds.

We cant do it on a monthly schedule. No one can.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Moore Insurance Desk" [...] {{is nearly}} twice {{as big as the}} [...] "Office Queen" [...] and {{combines}} a standing desk and a normal [...] "sitting" [...] desk in a single piece of furniture. It was patented in 1882. Like the [...] "Office Queen" [...] it opens up by means of a single large door, and its internal work surface slides in and out. But it also has an external work surface to accommodate a standing user, on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk.</b> The standing user employs the [...] "roof" [...] <b>of</b> the <b>desk</b> <b>of</b> the sitting user as his (or her) work surface.|$|R
50|$|To {{accompany}} the new look, BBC World swapped sets with BBC News 24, so that BBC World now used thusemall newsroom {{that had been}} used previously by News 24.

His keen, gray eyes were upon the king, and sorrow was written upon his face. He was Ludwig von der Tann, chancellor of the kingdom of Lutha.|$|R
50|$|The model 102 {{telephone}} {{consisted of}} the handset mounting typically placed on the desk top and a physically separate desk set box or subscriber set. This box was typically {{mounted on a wall}} near the phone or on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a <b>desk.</b> The desk set contained only the dial, a handset cradle with hook switch, and the handset positioned in the cradle, while the subscriber set contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the unit with the telephone network.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wadham, Senior, was an {{excellent}} replica of his son, a little fatter, a little rosier {{and a little more}} verbose. He rose from behind his desk and bowed twice as his distinguished client entered. The Marquis indicated to Mr. Wadham, Junior, the chair upon which he proposed to sit, and waited while it was wheeled up to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk.</b> Then he withdrew his gloves in leisurely fashion and extended his hand to the older man, who clasped it reverently.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, veteran {{film and}} {{voice-over}} actor Aleksandr Belyavsky would routinely get approached {{in the street}} by ex-convicts who expressed admiration for what they {{thought to be the}} actor's former criminal background, citing the scene of Fox's interrogation where he is bleeding from his lip and arrogantly wipes the blood on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Sharapov's <b>desk.</b> In reality, Belyavsky had no criminal background whatsoever, and he improvised the entire scene by using cherry preserves he had borrowed from production assistants during a lunch break to simulate the blood.|$|R
60|$|He {{took out}} a drawer on the right--took it out bodily--then {{introduced}} his hand into the opening, running it along the inner <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>desk</b> until, no doubt, he touched a spring; for suddenly a small trap was opened.

He spread the latter before him, {{and handed it to}} Mr. Caryll, who ran an eye over it.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{stimulus}} cards are {{presented to the}} participant.

The test takes approximately 12-20 minutes to carry out and generates a number of psychometric scores, including numbers, percentages, and percentiles of: categories achieved, trials, errors, and perseverative errors.|$|R
