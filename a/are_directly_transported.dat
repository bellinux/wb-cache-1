One major atheroprotective mechanism of HDL and apoA-I is their role in reverse cholesterol transport, i. e., the transport of excess cholesterol from foam cells to the liver for secretion. The ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 play {{a pivotal role in}} this process by effluxing lipids from foam cells to apoA-I and HDL, respectively. In the liver, ABCA 1 activity is one rate-limiting step in the formation of HDL. In macrophages, ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 prevent the excessive accumulation of lipids and thereby protect the arteries from developing atherosclerotic lesions. However, the mechanisms by which ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 mediate lipid removal are still unclear. Particularly, three questions remain controversial and are discussed in this review: (1) Do apoA-I and HDL directly interact with ABCA 1 and ABCG 1, respectively?

Chylomicrons from villous {{columnar}} {{epithelial cells}} are generally {{known to be}} transported only by central lymph vessels (CLV), whereas antigenic particulates derived from the intestinal lumen can also be transported by subepithelial blood capillaries (sBCs) in rat intestinal villi. The possibility of chylomicron absorption by sBCs was histoplanimetrically studied in the rat jejunum under a transmission electron microscope. The chylomicrons more abundantly presented in villous venules than in arterioles. The most frequent size (MFS) of chylomicrons was 75 to 90 nm in diameter in the areas near sBCs, while it was 45 to 60 nm in the epithelial intercellular spaces just above sBCs or the intermediate areas between sBCs. The MFS of chylomicrons was 45 to 60 nm in the intermediate areas between sBCs and in the epithelial intercellular spaces just above these areas. The MFS of chylomicrons in CLV was intermediate between that in the area adjacent to sBCs {{and that in the}} intermediate areas between sBCs. Chylomicrons were found in small vesicles in the endothelial cytoplasms of sBCs. No chylomicrons larger than 600 nm were observed in the lamina propria.

Bare land was used as a reference plot. The results show that, the sediment loss in a bare land reported to be 1. 5, 3, 2. 7 and 1. 3, 2. 1, 1. 9 in 100 % and 80 % cover plots. The runoff rate as compared to bare land, shown to be about 2 times less for white clover and rye grass plots, while more than 2 times less for integrated grasses plots. The total nitrogen and organic matter loss the results were in the order bare land white clover rye grasses and integrated grasses in which 100 %, 80 % and 50 % vegetative cover shown to perform better.

40|$|The role of clathrin in {{intracellular}} sorting {{was investigated}} by {{expression of a}} dominant-negative mutant form of clathrin, termed the hub fragment. Hub inhibition of clathrin-mediated membrane transport was established by demonstrating a block of transferrin internalization and an alteration in the intracellular distribution of the cation-independent mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor. Hubs {{had no effect on}} uptake of FITC-dextran, adaptor distribution, organelle integrity in the secretory pathway, or cell surface expression of constitutively secreted molecules. Hub expression blocked lysosomal delivery of chimeric molecules containing either the tyrosine-based sorting signal of H 2 M or the dileucine-based sorting signal of CD 3 γ, confirming a role for clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) in recognizing these signals and sorting them to the endocytic pathway. Hub expression was then used to probe the role of CCVs in targeting native molecules bearing these sorting signals in the context of HLA–DM and the invariant chain (I chain) complexed to HLA–DR. The distribution of these molecules was differentially affected. Accumulation of hubs before expression of the DM dimer blocked DM export from the TGN, whereas hubs had no effect on direct targeting of the DR–I chain complex from the TGN to the endocytic pathway. However, concurrent expression of hubs, such that hubs were building to inhibitory concentrations during DM or DR–I chain expression, caused cell surface accumulation of both complexes. These observations suggest that both DM and DR–I chain <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> to the endocytic pathway from the TGN, DM in CCVs, and DR–I chain independent of CCVs. Subsequently, both complexes can appear at the cell surface from where they are both internalized by CCVs. Differential packaging in CCVs in the TGN, mediated by tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting signals, could be a mechanism for functional segregation of DM from DR–I chain until their intended rendezvous in late endocytic compartments...|$|E
30|$|It {{is assumed}} that the customers' demand is stock {{dependent}} and selling price dependent for the perfect quality items and less perfect items, respectively. Since the storage space of the showroom for perfect quality items is limited due to space problem and the demand of the corresponding items is stock dependent, hence a secondary warehouse is hired by the retailer on rental basis to store the excess amount of perfect quality items and these items are continuously transferred to the showroom concerned. The literature suggests that the holding cost of secondary warehouse per unit item per unit time {{is more than the}} holding cost of the showroom due to the preservation cost for maintaining the quality of the product and other costs related to holding large quantity of the product in the secondary warehouse. But in this paper, it has been considered that the holding cost of perfect quality items in the secondary warehouse is less than the holding cost of the showroom as the nature of the items are non-deteriorating and so having no preservation cost. The perfect quality items are transported to the showroom via secondary warehouse, and the less perfect quality items <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> to the related showroom. For this purpose, transportation cost is incurred to transport both quality items at the respective showrooms from the production center. Due to complexity of environment, inventory holding costs, idle costs, set-up costs, and transportation costs are considered as fuzzy rough type and these are reduced to crisp ones using fuzzy rough expectation. In order to optimize the production rate and raw material order size (the decision variables), the average profit function of the manufacturer is maximized as the manufacturer acts as a leader (Stakelberg approach), and the supplier as well as retailer are the followers of that chain. The decision variables are also optimized by maximizing the integrated average profit function of the chain. Finally, a comparative study has been made between both Stakelberg and integrated approaches. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the model.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that severely injured patients should be transported directly to a trauma centre bypassing the nearest hospital. However, the evidence remains inconclusive. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the benefits in terms of mortality of direct transport to a trauma centre versus primary treatment in a level II or III centre followed by inter hospital transfer to a trauma centre for severely injured patients without Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Patients and methods We used the regional trauma registry and included all patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 and an Abbreviated Injury Score < 4 for head injury. We adjusted for survival bias by including “potential transfers”: patients who died at the nearest hospitals before transportation to a trauma centre. Results A total of 439 patients was included. The majority of patients (349 / 439, 79 %) was transported directly to the level I trauma centre (direct group). The transferred group was formed by the remaining 90 patients, of whom 81 were transferred to the level I trauma centre after initial stabilisation elsewhere and 9 patients died in the emergency room before transfer to a level 1 trauma centre could occur. There were no significant differences in baseline and injury characteristics between the groups. Overall, 60 patients died in-hospital including 41 of the 349 patients (12 %) in the direct group and 19 of the 90 patients (21 %) in the transferred group. Nine of the 19 deaths in the transferred group were ascribed to potential transfers. After adjusting for prehospital Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and ISS, the odds ratio of death was 2. 40 (95 %CI: 1. 07 – 5. 40) for patients in the transfer group. When potential transfer patients were excluded from the analysis, the adjusted odds ratio of death was 1. 14 (95 %CI: 0. 43 – 3. 01). Conclusions After adjusting for survivor bias by including potential transfers, the results of this study suggest a lower risk of death for patients who <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> to a level I trauma centre than for patients who receive primary treatment in a level II or III centre and are transferred to a trauma centre. However, this finding was only significant when adjusting for survival bias and therefore we conclude that it is still uncertain if there is a lower risk of death for patients who are transported directly to a level I trauma centre.

The Ab only blocks the binding of its cognate peptide (SIINFEKL) but not other peptides (KVVRFKDL, ASNENMETM, and FAPGNYPAL). Therefore, most TAP-transported peptides must diffuse through the lumen of the ER before binding stably to MHC class I molecules...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Phosphorus {{deficiency}} {{is frequently}} the limiting factor in phytoplank-ton {{growth and the}} major source of selective pressure on single populations in a variety of aquatic environments. Phytoplankton spe-cies have several mechanisms that allow them to overcome phosphorus starvation, such as high-affinity uptake of orthophosphate (Pi), stand-by energy metabolism or utilization of phosphorus from stored polyphosphates. This short review is focused on the production of extracellular phosphatases that is usually ac-companied by high-affinity uptake of Pi. Ex-tracellular phosphatases are localized on the cell membrane, where they catalyze the lib-eration of Pi from various organic compounds that are too large to <b>be</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> into the cell.

These contractions result in an insect's abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called tracheae, which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect's body.
