The {{creation}} of private-sector {{jobs in the}} province was minimal, and private companies were driven away. A local journalist interviewed by journalist Jorge Lanata said that this placed de facto restrictions on economic freedom and allowed Kirchner to control the population.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the impact of}} gender on work to family {{facilitation}} (WFF) is studied in three ways: direct, indirect through <b>available</b> <b>job</b> resources and as a moderator {{of the effect of}} these job resources on WFF. We looked hereby at four types of resources: job control, an enriched job content, social support and work-life support. In addition, it is investigated how the national gender culture influences this impact of gender. To this end, a large comparative dataset (N= 7, 867), with data from eight European countries is used. It is found that gender does not impact WFF directly; the effect runs through the <b>available</b> <b>job</b> recourses of men and women. When considering the national gender culture, we found in addition that compared to egalitarian countries and countries in between, only in traditional countries the positive effect of social support on WFF is stronger for women than for men...|$|R

5|$|Even {{with the}} growth of {{industry}} there were not enough good jobs: as a result, from 1841 to 1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the First World War, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, 10 per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily <b>available</b> <b>jobs</b> in the US and Canada, and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-eighteenth century. This contributed to the growth of the population, which reached a peak of 5,240,800 in 1974. Thereafter it began to fall slowly, moving down to 5,062,940 in 2000. There was also a decrease in some urban populations as a result of slum clearance, overspill and relocation to new towns, with the population of Glasgow falling from over a million in 1951 to 629,000 in 2001. Rural areas also saw a loss of population, particularly the Highlands and Hebrides. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century Scotland saw a rise in its population to 5,313,600 (its highest ever recorded) at the 2011 census.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1840s, {{after several years}} of failed crops and as food became scarce, much of the canton found itself deep in poverty. With more workers than <b>available</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{emigration}} to the United States of America was seen as a solution. The Glarus Emigration Society was established in 1844, which offered loans to help residents purchase land in the New World. Many of the resulting emigrants went to the state of Wisconsin, where they founded the town of New Glarus.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Hillsboro, {{like so many}} other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily {{dependent}} on agriculture. When local farmers have a bad harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of <b>available</b> <b>jobs</b> during the last few decades that it has been open.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} insight {{gained from}} {{this study is that}} the “exogenous” structure of <b>available</b> <b>job</b> opportunities is, besides widely discussed individual and social resources, crucial for IVET graduates’ successful integration into occupational labour markets. The preeminent importance of occupation-specific job opportunities indicates that vocational training systems need to provide the occupational skills demanded by employers to prevent their graduates from having to change occupations and to thus shelter them from the risk of entering the labour market via unskilled employment. In this regard, and also in light of shifts in demand towards the tertiary level (Sacchi, Salvisberg and Buchmann 2005), pathways from IVET to higher education that enable the young to increase their negotiating power for skilled positions and professional development—also outside their fields of their first training—are highly important. This study also highlights that further research analysing entries to occupational labour markets should take the structure of <b>available</b> <b>job</b> opportunities at the micro level into account. Not depicting the demand side adequately would mean leaving out one of the main driving factors behind transitions to occupational labour markets.|$|R
25|$|More <b>available</b> <b>jobs</b> in {{the cigar}} {{industry}} attracted more residents. Cigar workers found ready {{employment in the}} ever-growing number of large factories and small storefront shops (“buckeyes”) and came in ever-growing numbers. More immigration meant more amenities such as {{a wider range of}} businesses and more opportunities for social and cultural events, which in turn attracted more new residents, which attracted more businesses, etc. This cycle of growth lasted until the late 1920s, by which time Ybor City was home to hundreds of cigar making businesses {{and tens of thousands of}} permanent residents and had a thriving cultural scene.|$|E
25|$|While {{emigration}} {{began to}} tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per {{cent of the}} population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to retrace their paths. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily <b>available</b> <b>jobs</b> in the US and Canada and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-18th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{last years}} of the King's long reign were marked by natural catastrophes which caused great {{suffering}} for the Parisians; they began with a bad harvest followed by a famine {{in the winter of}} 1692-1693. Dozens of large ovens were built in the courtyard of the Louvre to bake bread for the poor, but the distribution of the loaves at central points around the city resulted in fighting and riots. That winter, fourteen or fifteen people a day died of hunger at the Hôtel Dieu hospital next to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Another bad harvest and severe winter hit Paris in 1708-1709, with temperatures reaching below 20 degrees (Celsius). The Seine froze from January 26 until April 5, making it impossible to deliver grain to the city by boat. During the summer of 1709, the government announced the creation of workshops for the poor and unemployed, who would receive 1.5 pounds of bread and two sous for each day of work. Six thousand persons lined up before dawn near the Porte Saint-Martin for two thousand <b>available</b> <b>jobs.</b> Riots followed, the crowds attacked Les Halles, and Musketeers had to occupy the main streets and squares to restore order. Placards criticizing the King and his government began to appear on the city gates, the churches and the main squares.|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{graduates}} from humanities, {{social sciences and}} arts are taught rather general skills, have a less distinct occupational profile and therefore need to compete more often with graduates of occupation-specific fields and lower educated individuals about any <b>available</b> <b>job</b> vacancies in the high-skilled labour market (Klein 2011 a).

25|$|Final Fantasy III saw the {{introduction}} of the Job Change System: through special crystals, the four player characters were granted a variety of jobs or character classes that could be switched at any point by the player. The Job Change system was initially proposed by Sakaguchi as he wanted to give players freedom to customize the party members: with five characters with eight jobs each, the team needed to create forty different pixel portraits. The Job System has continued to have a strong role in the series, being most prominent in Final Fantasy V with twenty-two <b>available</b> <b>jobs.</b> Jobs have recurring functions throughout the series. Some of the more traditional classes include the Warrior/Fighter, the Dragoon, the Thief and variations on magical classes such as White and Black Mages. More original classes have appeared throughout the series, such as Bards, Scholars, and Summoners. Due to the series' popularity, they have become staples of RPGs since their debut. The complexity and scope of the class system varies from game to game. The original Final Fantasy XIV did away with the Job System in favour of a character class-driven system where equipment determined skills and growth. For the later stages of Final Fantasy XIV and later A Realm Reborn, the Job System was reintroduced as a second level to the current class system. Many Jobs, such as the Dragoon, the Summoner, and the Red Mage have become closely identified with the series.|$|E

Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way we will start anything in Jaywick is for us to lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of <b>available</b> <b>jobs.</b> He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

2500|$|While {{full-time}} work hinders schooling, {{empirical evidence}} is varied {{on the relationship}} between part-time work and school.

Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home.
