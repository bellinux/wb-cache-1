5|$|A {{red cross}} {{was a symbol}} for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became {{associated}} with Saint George, along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their patron saint <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> cross as a banner. Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of {{the design of the}} Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to {{a decrease in the}} population when farms were cleared, the valley flooded and property {{in the western part of}} the village demolished. William Lever bought the Rivington Hall estate at the turn of the 20th century <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> wealth to renovate the old barns and create a large public park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Murdoch's {{previous}} {{foray into}} the sport was advising Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar to support Terry Venables's takeover bid for Tottenham Hotspur. The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose not to make a bid for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E
5|$|While Joseph Priestley {{was writing}} {{about the history of}} electricity, Franklin {{encouraged}} him to use an electrostatic machine to perform the experiments he {{was writing about}}. Priestly designed <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> own variations of Franklin's machine. While replicating the electrical experiments, some unanswered questions prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767 he published a 700-page book on his findings called The History and Present State of Electricity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|Boyd closely {{based his}} version of the Bond {{character}} on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed any of the film versions. The novel is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> experiences during the civil war to provide the location for the novel. He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the novel he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the novel, with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond.|$|E
5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> {{recordings}} from his trip for {{the sounds of}} wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E

5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should control their own destiny <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could agree on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Stigand was an {{influential}} advisor at court <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> position {{to increase his}} own wealth {{as well as that}} of his friends and family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I, {{influenced}} by her royal favourite Robert Dudley, appointed Sir Henry Sidney as President of the Council in 1560, {{and he took}} up residence at Ludlow Castle. Henry was a keen antiquarian {{with an interest in}} chivalry, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> post to restore much of the castle in a late-perpendicular style. He extended the castle by building family apartments between the Great Hall and Mortimer's Tower, and used the former royal apartments as a guest wing, starting a tradition of decorating the Great Hall with the coats of arms of council officers. The larger windows in the castle were glazed, a clock installed and water piped into the castle. The judicial facilities were improved with a new courthouse converted out of the 14th-century chapel, facilities for prisoners and storage facilities for the court records, Mortimer's Tower in the outer bailey being turned into a record depository. The restoration was generally sympathetic and, although it included a fountain, a real tennis court, walks and viewing platform, it was less ephemeral a make-over than seen in other castle restorations of the period.|$|E

5|$|Habré {{selected}} as the first target for his reconquest of northern Chad the well-fortified Libyan communications base of Fada. It was defended by 2,000 Libyans and {{the bulk of the}} Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) militia (Gaddafi's closest Chadian allies), well-provided with armour and artillery. Hassan Djamous, the thirty-year-old FANT commander-in-chief, pitched about 4,000–5,000 men against Fada's Libyan garrison. Taking advantage of his army's superior knowledge of the terrain, which apparently included unknown access points to the base, Djamous avoided a frontal assault <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> forces' high mobility to surround the Libyan positions and then unleashed his troops, destroying the defending garrison. In the battle, 784 Libyans were killed and 100 tanks destroyed, while only 50 FANT soldiers died.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|His tasks {{included}} finding {{experts to}} examine and report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of £1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E

5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo's travel to Spain, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader {{on how to use}} a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances).|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War, Alderson returned to South Africa to command the Mounted Infantry against the Boer forces. His experience with mounted infantry made him ideal for this role as in the Boer guerillas, the British were fighting against masters of mounted infantry tactics and suffered heavy losses from their hit and run campaigns. Alderson was instrumental in forming British counter-tactics <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> brigade to great effect against the Boers, his elite troops being two regiments of Canadian soldiers. The force was under the overall command of experienced British soldier Edward Hutton, previously GOC Canadian Militia, who became a lifelong friend. Among Canadians he was popular, being preferred to the tactless Hutton by the commander of the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, and in 1901 the then Governor General of Canada, Lord Minto, unsuccessfully petitioned the British government to have Alderson brought to Canada as GOC Militia.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>his</b> knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
