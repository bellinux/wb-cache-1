40|$|Reducing power {{consumption}} {{has become one}} of the biggest challenges in VLSI design. In control-flow intensive designs like networking and controller applications the largest fraction of {{power consumption}} in CMOS is caused by signal switches. The presented approach addresses the reduction of switching activity. This is basically done by state assignment concerning a given user-specified input pattern sequence. Besides reducing register switchmgs, power can be saved by e. g. a partial deactivation of the circuit or a parts of it. There is a strong dependency between the used deactivation method, the selection of circuit parts for <b>deactivation,</b> the <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation</b> logic and the state assignment. The aim of this paper is to consider these dependencies in a multi-criteria 1 optimization approach. This is done by an unified specification of the <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation</b> costs as constraints for state encoding. The result of our investigation is a multicriterial assignment procedure which enables us to specify an optimal code conceming different criteria. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{remote sensing}} of natural waters using {{luminescence}} techniques the remotely detected data {{need to be}} care-fully calibrated and adjusted to laboratory conditions. One of the phenomena that can complicate the calibra-tion procedure {{is the effect of}} fluorescence saturation. Saturation becomes important if the rate of chromo-phore excitation exceeds the rate of their <b>deactivation.</b> Especially when <b>measuring</b> fluorescence with laser pulse excitation this effect appears as a non-linearity of the detected signal versus the intensity of excitation pulses. This is noticeable if the photon flux exceeds about 1024 photons per second and cm 2, which corre-sponds to laser pulses of about 1 MW and is typical in many laboratory experiments. In this paper we report on the theory of the effect and on experimental results found with natural water sam-ples. On the basis of the non-linear balance equations for photon absorption and spontaneous emission a ki-netic theory is developed. Solutions for quasi-stationary and non-stationary conditions are given which include singlet-singlet annihilation as an <b>additional</b> non-radiative <b>deactivation</b> channel. It has been observed in experiments that the normalised fluorescence of marine water samples measured at low excitation intensity can be two times higher than excited with 10 mJ pulse en-ergy.

Deactivation in medial posterior and frontal regions {{is associated with}} the ability to focus attention on the demands of the task, and therefore, with consciousness. Studies investigating patients with impaired consciousness, that is, patients in minimally conscious state and patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (formerly vegetative state), demonstrate that these patients show responses to self-related content in the anterior cingulate cortex. However, it remains unclear if these responses are an indication for conscious processing of stimuli or are due to automatic processing. To shed further light on this issue, we investigated responses of cortical midline regions to the own and another name in 27 patients with a disorder of consciousness and compared them to task-induced deactivation. While almost all of the control subjects responding to the own name demonstrated higher activation due to the self-related content in anterior midline regions and <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation,</b> none of the responding patients did so. Differences between groups showed a similar pattern of findings. Despite the relation between behavioral responsiveness in patients and activation in response to the own name, {{the findings of this study}} do not provide evidence for a direct association of activation in anterior midline regions and conscious processing. The deficits in processing of self-referential content in anterior midline regions may rather be due to general impairments in cognitive processing and not particularly linked to impaired consciousness...|$|R

Because of the possibility of functionalizing the borazine core with different groups on the aryl substituents at the N and B atoms of the borazino core, we have prepared borazino-doped polyphenylenes featuring different doping dosages and orientations. To achieve this, two molecular modules were prepared: a core and a branching unit. Depending on the chemical natures of the central aromatic module and the reactive group, each covalent combination of the modules yields one exclusive doping pattern. By means of this approach, three- and hexa-branched hybrid polyphenylenes featuring controlled orientations and dosages of the doping B 3 N 3 rings have been prepared. Detailed photophysical investigations showed that as the doping dosage is increased, the strong luminescent signal is progressively reduced. This suggests that the presence of the B 3 N 3 rings engages <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation</b> pathways, possibly involving excited states with an increasing charge-separated character that are restricted in the full-carbon analogues. Notably, a strong effect of the orientational doping on the fluorescence quantum yield was observed for those hybrid polyphenylene structures featuring low doping dosages. Finally, we showed that Cu-catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition is also chemically compatible with the BN core, further endorsing the inorganic benzene as a versatile aromatic scaffold for engineering of molecular materials with tailored and exploitable optoelectronic properties...|$|R
40|$|Benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (BAL) and carbonylreductase from Candida parapsilosis (CPCR) are {{versatile}} catalysts for {{the production}} of various chiral intermediates, which are of interest for the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the mostly hydrophobic reactants only low productivities can be achieved in aqueous reaction systems and thus the use of alternative reaction media is desirable. Especially the use of aqueous-organic biphasic systems is promising, since the extraction of products and the spatial separation from the enzyme facilitate efficient processes. However, both enzymes show only insufficient stability in these systems and therefore a stabilisation is indispensable. Stability of both enzymes was determined in three different biphasic systems as well as the respective solvent-saturated aqueous monophasic systems (BAL: MTBE, 2 octanone, toluene; CPCR: MTBE, cyclohexane, n heptane). It was shown that BAL was already significantly deactivated by the solvent molecules within the aqueous phase. In the respective biphasic systems especially the interfaces towards 2 -octanone and toluene led to considerable <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation.</b> On the molecular level CPCR was deactivated mainly by dissolved MTBE-molecules. In contrast, dissolved cyclohexane and n-heptane molecules only had minor effects on CPCR stability, whereas the respective biphasic systems led to significant deactivation of CPCR. The deactivation by the solvents is probably a result of interactions between the solvents and the proteins’ surfaces. Therefore the surface characteristics of both enzymes were altered in order to prevent these interactions. Chemical modification of free amino groups was applied to introduce new chemical functionalities to the enzymes’ surfaces. Acetylation with cyclic anhydrides decreased activity of both enzymes significantly. In contrast, modification with mPEG 750 and mPEG 2000 resulted in good residual activities of BAL (60 - 70 %), while CPCR retained less than 10 % residual activity. Gel electrophoresis showed that apparently only few amino groups of BAL were accessible for mPEG-modification, whereas CPCR was modified to great extent. Storage stability measurements with the mPEG-BAL-variants revealed a considerable increase of stability towards dissolved molecules in the solvent systems with MTBE and toluene. Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to exchange unpolar surface amino acid residues against polar amino acid residues in order to decrease interactions between the enzymes and the solvents. Most of the resulting BAL-variants showed similar activities as the native BAL, whereas many CPCR-variants lost most of their activity. For both enzymes enantioselectivity was unaffected by the introduced mutations. Kinetic constants of BAL-variants differed only marginally from the ones of native BAL. CPCR-variants exhibited higher kcat-values than native CPCR in both reduction- and oxidation reaction. Determination of storage stability in the different mono-and biphasic systems showed that most variants exhibited decreased stability against dissolved solvent molecules compared to native enzymes. However, <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation</b> at the interface towards toluene (BAL) and MTBE, cyclohexane und n-heptane (CPCR) respectively, was decreased. For the technical application enzyme stability under relevant process conditions is of importance. Therefore a reactor set-up was established, that allows stability determination in reactive, aqueous-organic biphasic systems. Respective measurements with BAL indicated that deactivation by the aldehyde substrate superimposed the deactivation by the solvents, thus resulting in similar BAL stability in all tested solvent systems. Neither the mPEG-modification nor the introduced mutations prevented this deactivation by the substrate. CPCR showed a strong stability decrease under process conditions in the MTBE-system, probably due to a combined effect of dissolved MTBE-molecules and isopropanol which was used for substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration. CPCR stability in reactive systems with cyclohexane and n-heptane was comparable to stability under non-reactive conditions. Variant CPCR-I 79 T,V 83 S showed increased process stability in all three biphasic systems...|$|R

Therefore, n-heptane was transformed in presence of phenol over mechanical mixtures of HY and HZSM- 5 zeolites, at 450 degrees C, to evaluate the FCC catalysts behaviour during phenolic-rich bio-oils/conventional FCC feedstocks co-processing. Phenol induces an <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation</b> of the zeolites mixtures {{from the beginning of}} the reaction because increases the carbon deposition, as for pure zeolites. However, mixing the zeolites, the impact of phenol on HZSM- 5 seems to not be as strong as for HZSM- 5 alone due to an initial preferential adsorption of phenol on HY, as suggested by the adsorption energies of phenol on these catalysts calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT), - 80 kJ mol(- 1) for HY and - 60 kJ mol(- 1) for HZSM- 5. This agrees with the initial products distribution, which points out an enhancement of 14 - 20 % in the paraffins/olefins molar ratio and of about 40 % in the amount of branched species on the effluent in presence of phenol, as for pure HY. The HZSM- 5 further resistance against phenol, when mixed with HY, decreases by increasing phenol content from 1. 2 wt. % to 4 wt. %. Hence, at an industrial level, the FCC catalyst should suffer a lower effect of phenol on the ZSM- 5 additive function than expected, which would be certainly dependent on the amount of each zeolite in the FCC catalysts formulations and on the fraction of phenolic species in the FCC feedstock...|$|R

A series of ligands based on 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane have been prepared, in which the nitrogen atoms are appended with coordinating phosphinate or amide groups, or a combination of both. The compounds obtained are octadentate ligands which form water-soluble lanthanide complexes of high stability. Complexes incorporating aryl groups in the pendent arms have been prepared and some display intense metal luminescence following excitation into the organic chromophores. A back energy transfer process occurs in the terbium complexes containing naphthyl or quinohnone groups. Measurements of the luminescence lifetimes in H(_ 2) O and H(_ 2) O show diat diere are no metal-bound water molecules in the tetrabenzylphosphinate complexes. Those incorporating one amide and three phosphinate groups display hydration states between 0 and 1. An attempt has been made to correlate this information with that obtained from an analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion profiles of related gadolinium complexes.

40|$|Hydrogen powered {{fuel cells}} have the {{potential}} to produce electricity with higher efficiency and lower emissions than conventional combustion technology. In order to realize the benefits of a hydrogen fuel cell an efficient method to produce hydrogen is needed. Currently, over 90 % of hydrogen is produced from the steam reforming of natural gas. However, for many applications including fuel cell vehicles, the use of a liquid fuel rather than natural gas is desirable. This work investigates the feasibility of producing hydrogen efficiently by steam reforming E 85 (85 % ethanol/ 15 % gasoline), a commercially available sulfur-containing transportation fuel. A Rh-Pt/SiO 2 -ZrO 2 catalyst has demonstrated good activity for the E 85 steam reforming reaction. An industrial steam reforming process is often run less efficiently, with more water and at higher temperatures, in order to prevent catalyst deactivation. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a process that can operate without catalyst deactivation at more energy efficient conditions. In this study, the steam reforming of a sulfur-containing fuel (E 85) was studied at near stoichiometric steam/carbon ratios and at 650 C, conditions at which catalyst <b>deactivation</b> is normally <b>measured.</b> At these conditions the catalyst was found to be stable steam reforming a sulfur-free E 85. However, the addition of low concentrations of sulfur significantly deactivated the catalyst. The presence of sulfur in the fuel caused catalyst deactivation by promoting ethylene which generates surface carbon species (coke) that mask catalytic sites. The amount of coke increased during time on stream and became increasingly graphitic. However, the deactivation due to both sulfur adsorption and coke formation was reversible with air treatment at 650 C. However, regenerations were found to reduce the catalyst life. Air regenerations produce exotherms on the catalyst surface that cause structural changes to the catalyst. During regenerations the accessibility of the precious metal particles is reduced which causes the catalyst to deactivate more rapidly during subsequent steam reforming cycles. Changes to the carrier morphology also occur at these conditions. Regenerating the catalyst before significant <b>deactivation</b> is <b>measured</b> can improve the stability of the catalyst. Thus a process with preemptive controlled air regenerations is proposed in order to run a steam reforming process with sulfur containing fuels...|$|R
50|$|These {{catalysts}} often tend towards deactivation {{and display}} poor reusability qualities.

Tellurium (Te) is a very promising n-type dopant with high reported n-type doping densities. However, the stability of this dopant during post-growth thermal processing is unknown. Supersaturated Te-doped InGaAs layers were grown by MOCVD at 500 °C. The electrically active concentration of Te doping was 4. 4 × 1019 cm− 3 as grown. The thermal stability of the Te was investigated by studying the effect of post-growth annealing between 550 and 700 °C on the electrical activation.

Although the nanostructured Pd@CeO 2 /Si-Al 2 O 3 catalyst is thermally stable, the addition of water to the reaction feed leads to a transient deactivation at low temperatures, consistent with the well documented competitive adsorption. In addition to this, the hierarchically structured catalyst exhibits an <b>additional</b> severe <b>deactivation</b> after methane oxidation {{in the presence of}} water vapor at 600 degrees C that can be reversed only by heating the catalyst above 700 degrees C. The presence of water in the reaction feed deactivates the conventional impregnated catalyst less severely and the activity largely returns upon water removal.

These hydroxyl groups are suggested to significantly inhibit the oxygen spillover from the CeO 2 nanoparticles to Pd, preventing its efficient re-oxidation, as observed by operando X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) experiments.

Time and voltage dependence of the outward rectifying K+ currents have been analyzed with Hodgkin-Huxley-like (HH) models. Dynamic responses of whole cell currents to pulse potentials were analyzed with two voltage dependent functions, the Boltzmann distribution for open probability per gate and the transition rate towards the open state (alpha).

Deactivated macrophages consumed H 2 O 2 {{at the same rate}} as activated cells (t 1 / 2, 35 - 40 min for 25 nmol H 2 O 2 per 10 (6) peritoneal cells). They transported glucose with the same kinetics (Km, 1 mM; Vmax, approximately 100 nmol per 6 min per milligram cell protein), and maintained similar intracellular concentrations of NADPH and NADP (approximately 0. 62 mM and approximately 0. 11 mM, respectively), as measured by enzymatic cycling methods and determinations of the volume of cell water (3. 6 microliter/mg cell protein). To study the kinetics of the PMA-triggered NADPH oxidase in cell lysates, mixed detergents were used (deoxycholate and Tween 20). These stabilized the oxidase for approximately 3. 3 -fold longer than deoxycholate alone, which was used in previous studies. Incubation of activated macrophages in MDF resulted in a marked increase in the Km of the oxidase for NADPH, from 0. 06 mM to 0. 67 mM. The Vmax fell approximately 1. 7 -fold. These kinetic changes, together with the measured intracellular concentration of NADPH, account quantitatively for the suppression of H 2 O 2 release by deactivated macrophages, and are nearly the mirror image of the kinetic changes observed during macrophage activation...|$|R

Principle of the technology is the timetime correlated autoflourescence and an algorithm, which calculates the fractional dimension of the decreasing function. The device measures the fluorescence of a prostate-biopsy and calculates the fractional dimension of the tissue {{in less than two}} minutes. The result, malign or benign, is shown on a display. Different kinds of biomolecules are able to fluoresce energetically excited without any <b>additional</b> modification. After <b>deactivation</b> of the radiation source, the decay behavior of the inherent fluorescence intensity of the cell tissue is detected in a time resolved and spectrally resolved manner. By investigating prostate tissue, the correct classification, like benign and malign, could be stated in 93. 4 % of the analyzed points. In this case, the different autocorrelation function C(t) of the intensity decay behavior has been determined. The new approach confirms a high specificity and sensitivity and seems to offer a non-invasive and real-time detection technique. Through different clinical studies, we have shown the feasibility of our device and in recent publications, we also demonstrated the possibility of detecting cancer in other tissues like oral cavity...|$|R
40|$|Additional contributor: Lincoln Potter (faculty mentor) C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) {{activates}} the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B/GC-B), which stimulates cGMP synthesis and mediates {{long bone}} growth, vasorelaxation, and axonal guidance. Genetic mutations that disrupt normal signaling through this pathway lead to human skeletal over- and under-growth. Currently, {{the role of}} ATP in receptor activation is controversial. Although ATP is not required for initial activation, it may stabilize the catalytic domain at longer time points and increase its affinity for GTP. Enzymatic time course experiments conducted in crude membranes indicated that 1 mM ATP increases guanylyl cyclase activity 2 - 3 fold when measured at high (1 mM) GTP concentrations but increases activity 10 -fold at low (0. 1 mM) GTP concentrations. Moreover, receptor activity declines at a greater rate {{in the absence of}} ATP than in its presence at 0. 1 mM [GTP] versus 1 mM [GTP]. We propose that product inhibition, the binding of purine nucleotides and pyrophosphate to the catalytic domain, explains the observed receptor <b>deactivation.</b> <b>Additional</b> experiments are underway to characterize the roles of P-site inhibitors on GC-B activity, which may provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism of guanylyl cyclase receptors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAllosteric {{modulators}} and mutations {{that slow}} AMPAR desensitization have <b>additional</b> effects on <b>deactivation</b> and agonist potency. We investigated whether these are independent actions or the natural consequence of slowing desensitization. Effects of cyclothiazide (CTZ), trichlormethiazide (TCM), and CX 614 were compared at wild-type GluR 1 and “nondesensitizing” GluR 1 -L 497 Y mutant receptors by patch-clamp recording with ultrafast perfusion. CTZ, TCM, or L/Y mutation all essentially blocked GluR 1 desensitization; however, {{the effects of}} L/Y mutation on deactivation and glutamate EC 50 were {{three to five times}} greater than for modulators. CTZ and TCM further slowed desensitization of L/Y mutant receptors but paradoxically accelerated deactivation and increased agonist EC 50. Results indicate that CTZ and TCM target deactivation and agonist potency independently of desensitization, most likely by modifying agonist dissociation (koff). Conversely, CX 614 slowed desensitization and deactivation without affecting EC 50 in both wild-type and L/Y receptors. The S 750 Q or combined L 497 Y-S 750 Q mutations abolished all CTZ and TCM actions without disrupting CX 614 activity. Notably, the S/Q mutation also restored L/Y deactivation and EC 50 to wild-type levels without restoring desensitization, further demonstrating that desensitization can be modulated independently of deactivation and EC 50 by mutagenesis and possibly by allosteric modulators...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} catalysts {{have been}} studied by different characterization techniques and by kinetic experiments at FT conditions: 12 % Co/γ-Al 2 O 3, 12 % Co - 0. 5 % Re/γ-Al 2 O 3, 12 % Co/SiO 2, 12 % Co - 0. 5 % Re/SiO 2, 12 % Co/TiO 2 and 12 % Co - 0. 5 % Re/TiO 2. Water {{is one of the}} products in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and will always be present in smaller or larger amounts during synthesis. The effect of water on the activity and selectivity of Co supported Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, using different supports, has been studied in a fixed bed reactor at 20 bar and 483 K (H 2 /CO = 2. 1). The amount of water inside the reactor was varied by changing the conversion and adding different amounts of water vapour to the feed (pH 2 /pH 2 O = 0. 38 ≈ 20 % and pH 2 /pH 2 O = 0. 76 ≈ 30 %). As a consequence of the water addition, the partial pressures of CO and H 2 were decreased. The effect of water on the activity depended on the type of support. For the alumina supported catalysts, a slight increase in the reaction rate was observed when the conversion was increased, and the rate of deactivation was enhanced. Adding ~ 20 % water resulted in a decrease in the reaction rate and more deactivation. Further water addition (~ 33 %) decreased the reaction rate even more and increased the rate of deactivation. The rate of deactivation was larger for the CoRe/Al 2 O 3 catalyst than for the unpromoted Co/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Part of the deactivation was recovered after water removal. For the silica supported catalysts, increased reaction rate and increased rate of deactivation were observed as the conversion was increased. By ~ 20 % water addition, the reaction rate and rate of deactivation were further increased. Adding larger amounts of water resulted in a decrease in the reaction rate and an <b>additional</b> <b>deactivation.</b> A minor part of the deactivation was recovered upon water removal. For the titania supported catalysts, increased reaction rate was obtained both as the conversion was increased and when ~ 20 % water was added. When adding ~ 33 % of water, the reaction rate was decreased and a small deactivation was observed. Very little permanent deactivation was observed after water removal for the TiO 2 supported catalysts. Common for all the catalysts was an increase in the C 5 + selectivity and a decrease in the CH 4 selectivity at increased conversion or by external water addition. Promoting with Re increased the reaction rate [gHC/gcat,h] and the C 5 + selectivity for all catalysts. The effect of Re on the selectivities was less pronounced for the alumina than for the silica and titania supports. The C 5 + selectivities were found to be dependent on the support, increasing in the order: Al 2 O 3 < SiO 2 < TiO 2. The dependency of the C 5 + selectivity on the support was connected to different pore sizes and/or particle sizes for the various supports. The catalysts were characterized by TPR, H 2 -chemisorption, O 2 -titration, N 2 - adsorption, XRD and STEM. The cobalt particle sizes increased with increasing average pore diameter of the supports, being smallest on alumina and largest on the titania support. On the large surface area supports, γ-Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2, Co 3 O 4 was found as agglomerates (clusters) of smaller particles. Single Co 3 O 4 particles, evenly distributed, were found on low surface TiO 2 support. From element analysis in STEM, rhenium seemed to be in closer connection with cobalt on silica and titania, compared to on -alumina. The activity and selectivity results are discussed in terms of the findings from the characterization techniques. A microkinetic model for formation of C 1 and C 2 olefins and paraffins during methanation conditions has been constructed. By using the unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) method for calculation of activation energies, the CO insertion mechanism was found to be energetically favoured compared to the carbide mechanism. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

METHODS: Activation and <b>deactivation</b> forces were <b>measured</b> in an Instron universal tensile machine at 3 mm/minute speed to a total displacement of 4 mm. Tests were repeated eight times for each bracket/wire combination. Statistical analysis comprised ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. RESULTS: Using a 4 -mm deformation, mean activation forces increased in the following order: Damon = 222 gf, Easy Clip = 228 gf, In-Ovation = 240 gf and Smart Clip = 306 gf. The same order was observed for mean hysteresis values, i. e., 128 gf, 140 gf, 150 gf and 206 gf, respectively. The respective values of deactivation forces for the Damon, Easy Clip, In-Ovation and Smart Clip brackets were 94 gf, 88 gf, 90 gf and 100 gf. CONCLUSIONS: Brackets with higher activation forces were accompanied by higher hysteresis values, which resulted in clinically similar deactivation forces, regardless {{of the type of}} self-ligating brackets used...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accessing {{information}} that defines personally familiar context in real-world situations {{is essential for}} the social interactions and the independent functioning of an individual. Personal familiarity is associated with the availability of semantic and episodic information as well as the emotional meaningfulness surrounding a stimulus. These features are known to be associated with neural activity in distinct brain regions across different stimulus conditions (e. g., when perceiving faces, voices, places, objects), which may reflect a shared neural basis. Although perceiving context-rich personal familiarity may appear unchanged in aging on the behavioral level, it has not yet been studied whether this can be supported by neuroimaging data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural network associated with personal familiarity during the perception of personally familiar faces and places. Twelve young and twelve elderly cognitively healthy subjects participated in the study. Both age groups showed a similar activation pattern underlying personal familiarity, predominantly in anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortices, irrespective of the stimulus type. The young subjects, but not the elderly subjects demonstrated an <b>additional</b> anterior cingulate <b>deactivation</b> when perceiving unfamiliar stimuli. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although we found evidence for an age-dependent reduction in frontal cortical deactivation, our data show that there is a stimulus-independent neural network associated with personal familiarity of faces and places, which is less susceptible to aging-related changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} the branching in polyacrylates is performed for both atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and free radical polymerization (FRP). In both cases the secondary radical formed can transfer to polymer to generate a tertiary radical, which can propagate with monomer to re-form the secondary species. The critical {{difference between these two}} processes is that the exchange between tertiary and secondary species is supplemented in ATRP by <b>additional</b> activation and <b>deactivation</b> reactions for both the secondary and tertiary species. This leads to a competition between the activation-deactivation and exchange processes in ATRP, while there is no such competition in FRP. This introduces the idea of competing processes or equilibria. These competing Processes can alter the fate of the tertiary radical in ATRP, by introducing a deactivation step, in addition to the propagation, or branch formation, available in FRP. Various simulations show that, in order to effectively decrease the branching fraction in ATRP, the tertiary radical must be deactivated relatively rapidly. Then, the rate of branch formation is slower than the rate of transfer, resulting in a decrease in the branching fraction. Kinetic simulations also find that concentrations of copper catalysts have minimal effect on the branching fractions and that higher initiator concentrations tend to decrease the branching levels in ATRP. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations found that chain length dependence and presence or absence of intermolecular transfer had minimal effect on the branching fraction...|$|R
40|$|Currents through maxi K+ {{channels}} {{were recorded}} in inside-out macro- patches. Using a liquid filament switch (Franke, C., H. Hatt, and J. Dudel. 1987. Neurosci, Lett. 77 : 199 - 204) the Ca 2 + concentration {{at the tip of}} the patch electrode ([Ca 2 +]i) was changed in less than 1 ms. Elevation of [Ca 2 +]i from less than 10 nM to 3, 6, 20, 50, 320, or 1, 000 microM activated several maxi K+ channels in the patch, whereas return to less than 10 nM deactivated them. The time course of Ca(2 +) - dependent activation and deactivation was evaluated from the mean of 10 - 50 sweeps. The mean currents started a approximately 10 -ms delay that was attributed to diffusion of Ca 2 + from the tip to the K+ channel protein. The activation and deactivation time courses were fitted with the third power of exponential terms. The rate of activation increased with higher [Ca 2 +]i and with more positive potentials. The rate of deactivation was independent of preceding [Ca 2 +]i and was reduced at more positive potentials. The rate of <b>deactivation</b> was <b>measured</b> at five temperatures between 16 and 37 degrees C; fitting the results with the Arrhenius equation yielded an energy barrier of 16 kcal/mol for the Ca 2 + dissociation at 0 mV. After 200 ms, the time-dependent processes were in a steady state, i. e., there was no sign of inactivation. In the steady state (200 ms), the dependence of channel openness, N. P(o), on [Ca 2 +]i yielded a Hill coefficient of approximately 3. The apparent dissociation constant, KD, decreased from 13 microM at - 50 mV to 0. 5 microM at + 70 mV. The dependence of N. P(o) on voltage followed a Boltzmann distribution with a maximal P(o) of 0. 8 and a slope factor of approximately 39 mV. The results were summarized by a model describing Ca 2 +- and voltage-dependent activation and deactivation, as well as steady-state open probability by the binding of Ca 2 + to three equal and independent sites within the electrical field of the membrane at an electrical distance of 0. 31 from the cytoplasmic side...|$|R

Patients with at least two abnormal (< 2 standard deviations from the normative values) neuropsychological tests at a standardized evaluation were considered cognitively impaired (CI). FMRI data were analyzed using the SPM 8 software, modeling regions showing load-dependent activations/deactivations with increasing task difficulty. Twenty (47 %) MS patients were CI. During the N-back load condition, compared to controls and CI patients, cognitively preserved (CP) patients had increased recruitment of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. As a function of increasing task difficulty, CI MS patients had reduced activations of several areas located in the fronto-parieto-temporal lobes as well as reduced deactivations of regions which are part of the default mode network compared to the other two groups. Significant correlations were found between abnormal fMRI patterns of activations and <b>deactivations</b> and behavioral <b>measures,</b> cognitive performance, and brain T 2 and T 1 lesion volumes. This multicenter study supports the theory that a preserved fMRI activity of the frontal lobe is associated with a better cognitive profile in MS patients.

"rm(V) values obtained from the turn-on of INa agree well with control axons and previous determinations by others, q'Na(V) values derived from Na tail currents were also unchanged by pronase treatment and matched fairly well previously published values. "rm(V) obtained from 3 x ~'N,(V) were much larger than 1 "re(V) obtained from INa turn-on at the same potentials, resulting in a discontinuous distribution. Steady-state In (gNa/gNm ~ ~ [...] gNa) VS. voltage was not linear and had a limiting logarithmic slope of 5. 3 mV/e-fold gNa. Voltage step procedures that induce a second turn-on of IN, during various stages of the deactivation (Na tail current) process reveal quasiexponential activation at early stages that becomes increasingly sigmoid as deactivation progresses. For moderate depolarizations, primary and secondary activation kinetics are superimposable. These data suggest that, although m a can describe the shape of INs turn-on, it cannot quantitatively account for the kinetics ofgNa after repolarization. Kinetic schemes for gN, in which substantial deactivation occurs by a unique pathway between conducting and resting states are shown to be unlikely. It appears that the rate-limiting step in linear kinetic models of activation may be between a terminal conducting state and the adjacent nonconducting intermediate...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} created {{as part of}} a project dealing with the preconditions, {{strategies}} and problems of comprehensive nuclear disarmament, and addresses an important aspect of the disarmament problem – verification. A one-hundred percent successful verification will never be achieved, but {{it would be wrong to}} conclude that a nuclear weapon free world is only acceptable in the casee of perfect verification. The demands on verification depend to a large extent on mutual trust between states and on previous experience of nuclear disarmament and its verification to date. The requirements will, however, rise in the course of the disarmament process. Particularly in the final phases, when the number of arsenals falls below a hundred, verification will have to satisfy extremely high demands both in terms of quantity and quality. The nuclear disarmament of nuclear weapon states can be carried out in many individual steps, the first of which are already taking place now or will be doing so in the near future. These steps include, among other things, <b>deactivation</b> <b>measures,</b> further reductions, dismantling of warheads, disposition of nuclear material from disarmed warheads and, finally, the destruction or conversion of nuclear weapon-related facilities. Only very few of these steps are already being verified today. Apart from declarations and transparency measures, the internationally binding commitment not to rescind measures once they are taken is an important factor. Verification would have to consist of a synergy of different methods. These include: the identification of warheads with the aid of nuclear-physical measurements, seals, all the IAEA safeguards used in the non-nuclear weapon states, extensive rights of access for challenge inspections, the use of satellite surveillance, National Technical Means, the disclosure of historical documents, the creation of maximum transparency in former nuclear weapon states, and the possibility of enforcing clarification of suspicions if necessary. The protection of proliferation relevant information must be considered. Once a nuclear weapons complex is destroyed, any further possession of nuclear weapons is extremely unlikely. Even after comprehensive disarmament, the world will have to live with permanent verification in order to detect any future attempts at secret rearmament in time. To this end, a universal verification system will have to be established which is capable of early detection of the different elements of a nuclear-weapon program. These include the acquisition of either high enriched uranium or plutonium, the development of ignition technology, the development of theoretical principles, the development of an infrastructure, acquisition activities, and not least secrecy measures. Here, too, a synergy of different verification measures will have to be implemented which should be based on the further development of IAEA safeguards, including all reforms. Other important elements of this synergy are the inclusion of all data, including those gathered by National Technical Means and espionage, the extremely extensive rights of access for the verification agency, the use of state-of-the-art equipment, including satellites, maximum transparency of all relevant activities, the reconstruction of production histories with the aid of historical documents, the impossibility of rejecting challenge inspections, the readiness of as many states as possible to co-operate, and the protection of informants. The probability that the II construction of several warheads will remain undetected despite a verification system of this kind is very low. There will always be a few states under suspicion which do not co-operate with the verification authorities, but it is precisely their activities that must be detected by verification. Historical cases of proliferation are South Africa, Iraq and North Korea. In all three cases, the verification system fell short of the standard which would be necessary for a nuclear weapon free world. The cases demonstrate that although it was possible to establish a number of suspicious indications using the then insufficient verification, important information was never revealed to the international community, for example, that South Africa had built six warheads, or that Iraq had intensively developed electromagnetic uranium enrichment. With the measures in place today, suspicions would have been aroused much earlier. South Africa’s activities would not have remained undetected with full-scope safeguards. In the case of North Korea, the measures of the IAEA were already more intrusive and lead to the emergence of concrete suspicion. But precise clarification of the North Korean activities is so far not possible, since there are no means of enforcing the inspections against the will of the state. The surveillance of the international transfer of technology plays an important role for the early detection of suspicious acquisition activities. How far subsequent verification of whether a state has totally disarmed is possible can be examined by studying the case of South Africa. There are, however, limitations for the comparison between South Africa and the established nuclear weapon states. An important element of a future system must be the possibility of using any kind of information and National Technical Means. A maximum level of transparency of all nuclear activities in all states, which must far exceed present levels of transparency, continues to be a prerequisite. This relates in particular to the nuclear activities of disarming nuclear weapon states. Furthermore, it must be possible to implement the measures flexibly. In the event of suspicion and a lack of co-operation, verification activities must be reinforced, whereas in cases where trust has become firmly established over a long period of time, it must be possible to reduce the level of activities. The successful implementation of verification measures depends not least also on the organisational structure of the verification system and must therefore be carefully considered. Rapid decision-making structures and the ability of assertion are of great importance. The decision-making body must be representative for the community of states. The Security Council could only be considered for this after a comprehensive reform. All technologies used should be internationalised as far as possible, e. g. the use of satellites, which are currently employed almost exclusively as National Technical Means. In the long term, individual verification organisations could be consolidated. The IAEA should provide the starting point for the development of the final organisational form for verification. The role of social verification must be reinforced. Even if the process of total nuclear disarmament is initiated by a relatively small number of states, in the end, all states must have committed themselves to relinquishing nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|In endothelial cells, {{release of}} Ca 2 + from {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) Ca 2 + stores activates Ca 2 + influx via the capacitative Ca 2 + entry (CCE) pathway. In cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we investigated {{the relationship between}} intracellular Ca 2 + store load and CCE activity, {{as well as the}} kinetics of CCE activation and <b>deactivation,</b> by simultaneously <b>measuring</b> changes in [Ca 2 +]i and unidirectional manganese (Mn 2 +) entry through the CCE pathway. Submaximal concentrations of ATP caused quantal release of Ca 2 + from the ER, resulting in a dose-dependent depletion of Ca 2 + stores and acceleration of Mn 2 + entry. Mn 2 + entry rate, as a measure of CCE activity, was graded with the amount of released Ca 2 +. Maximal activation of CCE did not require complete store depletion. Slow depletion of the ER by exposure to the ER Ca 2 + pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid resulted in a delayed activation of CCE, revealing a temporal dissociation between release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores and activation of CCE. During [Ca 2 +]i oscillations, at frequencies higher than 0 · 5 spikes min− 1, each Ca 2 + spike resulted in a progressive acceleration of CCE without leading to oscillations of Ca 2 + entry. In contrast, low frequency [Ca 2 +]i oscillations were paralleled by transient CCE that was activated and deactivated with each Ca 2 + spike, resulting in an oscillatory pattern of Ca 2 + entry. It is concluded that CCE is a rapidly activating process which is graded with store depletion and becomes fully activated before complete depletion. The duration of CCE activation correlates with the degree of store depletion and the time that is required to refill depleted stores. Overall, a mechanism of graded CCE prevents exhaustion of intracellular Ca 2 + reserves and provides an efficient way to respond to variable degrees of intracellular store depletion...|$|R
