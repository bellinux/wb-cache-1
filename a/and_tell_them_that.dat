500|$|The boys {{seek help}} from a medium (a parody of Zelda Rubinstein's {{character}} in Poltergeist), who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory, which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The medium manages to contact the spirits <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they have passed on. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all accept the fact. Two deceased celebrities, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze, tell her that Michael Jackson's refusal to acknowledge his death is {{the main cause of}} them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but also a little white girl. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which flings the medium out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, flight attendants and pilot voice-over announcements.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{rehabilitation}} cell, Zelena reads [...] "Hansel and Gretel" [...] to her unborn child, {{before going into}} pain, screaming and banging on the door. Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur to snuff out the light are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E
