50|$|Tourism is {{the main}} {{industry}} in the parish, due to its many historical sites. The main employer is the Brimstone Hill Fortress, which lies in actuality lies in the very North of the parish boundaries, although locally it is usually more {{closely associated with the}} town of Sandy Point. The massive fortress was the largest one ever built by the British in the Eastern Caribbean, and receives more visitors annually than any other site in the federation. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another large employer is the Caribelle Batik factory, on Romney Manor Estate. Often advertised as 'the most beautiful factory in the world,' the tourism-based factory lies within a 5 acre tropical garden, which in turn lies in the centre of the lush rainforests just above the town of Old Road. Batik wares are produced in the open <b>air</b> <b>setting</b> for visitors to see and purchase. The grounds were also famously once owned by the Jeafferson family, forefathers to the U.S. president Thomas Jefferson. Other sites include the tomb of Sir Thomas Warner in Middle Island, and the various rainforest trails starting at Romney Manor.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{depleted}} uranium alloy is pyrophoric; the heated {{fragments of the}} penetrator ignite after impact on contact with <b>air,</b> <b>setting</b> fire to fuel and/or ammunition in the target vehicle, contributing significantly to behind-armor lethality. Additionally, DU penetrators exhibit significant adiabatic shear band formation. A common misconception is that, during impact, fractures along these bands cause {{the tip of the}} penetrator to continuously shed material, maintaining the tip's conical shape, whereas other materials such as unjacketed tungsten tend to deform into a less effective rounded profile, an effect called [...] "mushrooming". Actually, the formation of adiabatic shear bands means that the sides of the [...] "mushroom" [...] tend to break away earlier, leading to a smaller head on impact, though it will still be significantly [...] "mushroomed". Tests have shown that the hole bored by a DU projectile is of a narrower diameter than for a similar tungsten projectile; and although both materials have nearly the same density, hardness, toughness and strength, due to these differences in their deformation process, {{depleted uranium}} tends to out-penetrate an equivalent length of tungsten alloy against steel targets. Nevertheless, the use of depleted uranium, in spite of some superior performance characteristics, is not without political and humanitarian controversy, but remains the material of choice for some countries due to cost considerations and strategic availability compared to tungsten. Complicating matters, when foreign deployment of military forces or export sales markets are considered, a sabot designed specifically to launch a DU penetrator cannot simply be used to launch a substitute WA penetrator, even of exactly the same manufactured geometry. The two materials behave significantly different under high pressure, high launch acceleration forces, such that entirely different sabot material geometries, (thicker or thinner in some places, if even possible), are required to maintain in-bore structural integrity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a qualitative effect of ventilation mode at daytime, night ventilation flow and outdoor air temperature, the temperature differences between of indoor <b>air</b> <b>setting</b> and outdoor air on cooling load reduction and indoor air temperature fluctuation at nighttime using thermal mass and night ventilation. A simple residential building model is chosen {{to obtain the}} hourly variation of cooling load at daytime and indoor air temperature at nighttime. It is noted that the temperature distribution of thermal mass material governed by an one-dimensional non-steady heat conduction equation. is considered in the paper. The dependence of the cooling load and indoor air temperature at nighttime on night ventilation flow, the outdoor air temperature, the temperature differences between of indoor <b>air</b> <b>setting</b> and outdoor air is further validated. Our results show that only suitable night ventilation flow with suitable outdoor climates and the appropriate temperature differences between of indoor <b>air</b> <b>setting</b> and outdoor air will benefit most. The present work provides guidance for designing night ventilation...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{demonstrate}} {{that the use of}} the dry mix that constitutes caustic magnesite and a micro-silica additive makes it possible to obtain a binding material that contributes to formation of a durable and water-resistant artificial stone. The results of the research performed through the employment of methods of Fourier IR spectroscopy and electronic microscopy are provided. Interaction between magnesium oxide (MgO) as the basic oxide and micro-silica as the acidic oxide is proposed. The compressive strength of the dry mix containing 16. 7 % of micro-silica has been measured. In the event of hydraulic hardening, the compressive strength is equal to 11. 5 MPa and 12. 0 MPa in dry and water-saturated states, respectively. In the aftermath of <b>air</b> <b>setting,</b> the compressive strength is 10. 0 MPa and 21. 0 MPa in dry and water-saturated states, respectively. Thereafter, the dry mix is gaged by the sulfuric acid solution (10 %) to identify the pH influence. In the event of hydraulic hardening, the compressive strength is 19. 8 MPa and 14. 1 MPa in dry and water-saturated states, respectively. In the aftermath of <b>air</b> <b>setting,</b> the compressive strength is 18. 0 MPa and 19. 9 MPa in dry and water-saturated states, respectively.
