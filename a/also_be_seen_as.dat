5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of}} the film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E

5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>as</b> can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a symbol of the}} cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and {{included}} artists influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who {{was influenced by}} expressionism. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity post-expressionist Gauguin. Isabel Babianska (b. 1920), was influenced by expressionist Chaim Soutine. Expressionism can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an influence {{on the work of}} Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of Van Gogh. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees Josef Herman (1911–2000), who was resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943 and Jankel Adler (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941–43. Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (1924–2007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's Transport Depot (1944–45) and Bet Low's Blochairn Steelworks (c. 1946).|$|E

5|$|The plot of Thespis, {{with its}} elderly gods tired {{of their life}} in Olympus, is similar to some of Offenbach's operas, notably Orphée aux Enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld). In Orphée aux Enfers, like Thespis, {{classical}} mythology, particularly the Olympian gods, are ruthlessly parodied. In Thespis, the gods swap places with the actors and descend to Earth; in Orphée aux Enfers, the gods head to hell for a pleasant holiday away from too much boring perfection. Offenbach's plot – for although Crémieux and Halévy wrote the libretto, the idea was Offenbach's – places Orpheus, the great musician, in the centre; however, Gilbert's plot focuses on Thespis, the Father of the Drama. While {{this may be a}} coincidence, it could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a response to Offenbach, as his plot places music at the centre of his operetta, but Gilbert's elevates the dramatist.|$|E
5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes {{it is used to}} embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E
