At the party, <b>Andrea</b> goes upstairs and finds Darcy making herself throw up in the bathroom. <b>Andrea</b> apologizes to Darcy about neglecting her and makes her promise to seek treatment for her eating disorder which Darcy agrees to. Darcy reveals that she was very jealous of <b>Andrea</b> because she appeared to have everything. <b>Andrea</b> helps Darcy clean up. When they leave the bathroom, <b>Andrea</b> and Darcy get accosted by a fellow classmate who often used to bully Richard and Greg. Richard intervenes, and reveals his longtime crush on Darcy, and asks her to dance, which Darcy agrees. <b>Andrea</b> watches Darcy and Richard dance, then gets approached by Cybil, who showed up to the party. Cybil expresses regret and sadness over Greg's suicide and says that she feels responsible. <b>Andrea</b> consoles her, and Cybil reveals her feelings for <b>Andrea</b> by kissing her on the lips. <b>Andrea</b> is surprised, and even though she doesn't reciprocate those feelings, she allows Cybil to kiss her anyway. <b>Andrea</b> leaves the party.|$|R

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George <b>Andreas</b> felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product.

Years later, <b>Andreas</b> reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. <b>Andreas</b> felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San <b>Andreas</b> Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San <b>Andreas</b> has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San <b>Andreas</b> Faults.|$|E

5000|$|After {{three months}} of {{repelling}} assaults, the city is at its last extremity. Don Esteban offers Camilla terms that are generous to her and her people, but would require her to surrender <b>Andrea</b> to Borgia. In love with <b>Andrea,</b> she rejects the terms, but <b>Andrea</b> gives himself up to Don Esteban {{at the price of}} putting the terms in writing. At a triumphal dinner with Camilla, who has begged him to spare <b>Andrea's</b> life, Borgia hauls in <b>Andrea,</b> tortured by Don Esteban, and exposes [...] "the noble Orsini" [...] as a peasant. He brings <b>Andrea's</b> mother to confirm it. Borgia orders his death by starvation but Belli, now a lieutenant in Borgia's service, protests and demands to gouge out <b>Andrea's</b> eyes in front of everyone and make him a blind beggar. However Belli has secretly remained loyal to <b>Andrea</b> and fakes the disfigurement, and Mother Zoppo takes her son home. After Borgia moves on to another campaign, <b>Andrea</b> and Belli plot to free the imprisoned Camilla and help the people retake their city. Belli aids <b>Andrea</b> in entering the castle to rescue Camilla, but the signal for the citizen uprising is given before they can make their escape. <b>Andrea</b> kills Don Esteban in single combat, but is about to be killed by another officer after <b>Andrea</b> stumbles over Esteban's corpse. However Balgioni, an officer, weary of killing for Borgia and an admirer of <b>Andrea's,</b> recognizes and spares him. The uprising sparks widespread resistance to Borgia, and after his fall, <b>Andrea</b> and Camilla are married.|$|R

5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, <b>Andreas</b> Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, <b>Andreas</b> styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
