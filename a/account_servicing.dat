The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the reasons for Small Scale Entrepreneurs (SSEs) employment of <b>accounting</b> <b>services.</b> Secondly, this study seeks to decipher the benefits of SSEs engagement of <b>accounting</b> <b>services</b> from the perspective of the managers of such business enterprises in Nigeria.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the sourcing strategy for one business function (<b>accounting</b> <b>services),</b> by looking at the degree of outsourcing for each task of this function. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What sourcing strategy do SMEs use for <b>accounting</b> <b>services?</b> (2) What are the reasons? (3) Is there a link between sourcing strategy and company characteristics? The research design consisted of a postal survey sent out to 1200 managers of SMEs in Belgium. The main results showed that 53 % use selective outsourcing, i. e. combining both an inhouse accountant with an <b>accounting</b> <b>service</b> provider. The results also showed that 35 % use total insourcing and 12 % prefer total outsourcing. Surprisingly, cost reduction is not the main reason for outsourcing. External expertise is the main reason for selectively outsourcing. SMEs select a total insourcing strategy because they want the accounting information at hand. Finally, larger SMEs decide for a total insourcing strategy and prefer to keep the <b>accounting</b> <b>services</b> internal. The conclusions show that future research should focus on the degree of outsourcing. The practical implication of this study is that <b>accounting</b> <b>service</b> providers should highlight their expertise and overcome the disadvantage of remote data analysis to attract more SME-customers. status: publishe...|$|R
