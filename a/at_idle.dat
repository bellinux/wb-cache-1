5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

25|$|Efficiency is a {{function}} of power output. A moderate load makes for high efficiency. Too heavy a load increases the slip in the turbine and lowers the efficiency; with too light a load, little power is delivered to the output, which also decreases efficiency (to zero <b>at</b> <b>idle).</b> This behaviour is not exclusive to Tesla turbines.|$|E

40|$|Future lack of {{petroleum}} resources, price hike and environmental concerns {{have led to}} search for more environment friendly and renewable fuels. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel is considered as the most suitable alternative due to its environment friendly aspect and similar operation properties as diesel. In this study, Palm, Jatropha and Calophyllum biodiesel blends {{has been used to}} evaluate performance of a compression ignition engine operated <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> condition. Three idling modes were selected in which operating condition of engine were: a) 1000 RPM 10 % Load, b) 1200 RPM 12 % Load and c) 1500 RPM and 15 % Load. <b>At</b> high <b>idling</b> conditions biodiesel-diesel blends emit less HC and CO, but high amount of NOx compared to diesel fuel. <b>At</b> high <b>idling</b> conditions fuel consumption of biodiesel-diesel blends deteriorate.

25|$|Throttle lag {{occurs because}} turbochargers {{rely on the}} buildup of exhaust gas {{pressure}} to drive the turbine. In variable output systems such as automobile engines, exhaust gas pressure <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> low engine speeds, or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine. Only when the engine reaches sufficient speed does the turbine section start to spool up, or spin fast enough to produce intake pressure above atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Months after Tom McGrath filed a suit {{on behalf}} of {{business}} owners and residents against the noise ordinance enacted by the city to push away motorcycle rallies, the Myrtle Beach city council increased the noise limit.

The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.|$|E

40|$|The rudder {{effect of}} a sport {{airplane}} at high angles of attack was to be improved. This made it necessary to make a cut-out {{in the center of}} the continuous elevator so as to enlarge the rudder downward. This cut-out which reduced the rudder area by 12. 5 percent changed the static stability of the airplane as well as the elevator effect. Flight measurements showed the stability zone with locked elevator to be 1. 8 percent less at full throttle and <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> to be 1. 3 percent less than the mean wing chord. The effect of the cut-out on the control forces could not be determined owing to insufficient instrumental accuracy at the extremely low existing forces. The measurement of the static controllability resulting from the cut-out manifested an 18 percent drop in elevator effect at full throttle and a 10 to 20 percent drop <b>at</b> <b>idling,</b> depending on lift...|$|R
25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} {{without the use}} of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> {{can also be used to}} reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed mild hybrids.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, Nissan is recalling {{nearly one}} million {{vehicles}} for {{a problem with}} the airbags. The occupant classification system (OCS) may incorrectly think that the passenger seat is empty when it is occupied by an adult, failing to activate the airbag in a collision. Cars affected include the 2013–14 model year Leaf, Altima, Pathfinder and Sentra, as well as the 2013 NV200, 2013 JX35, 2014 QX60 and the 2014 Q50. Recall documents say that due to the sensitivity of the OCS software calibration, the system may not sense a passenger. That combined with high-engine vibration <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> when the seat is empty and then becomes occupied, or unusual occupant seating postures, can cause the system to fail. If the car crashes during this time, the airbag won't deploy. Nissan will notify owners, and dealerships will fix the OCS software free of charge.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternative}} pathway is continuously activated {{at a low}} level, analogous to a car engine <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> {{as a result of}} spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The {{alternative pathway}} does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, {{the inquiry}} was reopened to hear new evidence. The final report into the {{accident}} was published on 7 May. It was established {{that there was nothing}} mechanically wrong with the aircraft at the time it crashed, although the engines were operating <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> power. A number of issues were raised, including the rostering of the crew, the captain's failure to ensure that he had all necessary navigational information, the captain's decision to divert to Le Bourget instead of returning straight to England, the inability of Cormeilles to handle two aircraft at once, and the captain's decision to return to England being made too late. Five recommendations were made {{as a result of the}} investigation. These were in relation to crewing, crew route familiarisation, provision of route information to crews, the ability of airfields to handle more than one aircraft at a time by radio and the introduction of new systems of working between the United Kingdom and France in respect of the control of air traffic and the hand-over of flights between the two countries. The latter was reported as already being under consideration at the time the report was published.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E

500|$|The {{aircraft}} used reheat (afterburners) at take-off and to {{pass through}} the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times. Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway. Fuel used is Jet A-1. Due to the high thrust produced even with the engines <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear - at low weights after landing, the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling [...] requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative {{processing}} of aircraft turbine-engine exhaust was studied using a potential aerosol mass (PAM) chamber at different engine loads corresponding to typical flight operations. Measurements were conducted at an engine test cell. Organic gases (OGs) and particle emissions pre/post PAM were measured. A suite of instruments, including a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) for OGs, a multi-gas analyzer for CO, CO 2, NO X, and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) for non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM 1) were used. Total aerosol mass {{was dominated by}} secondary aerosol formation, which was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the primary aerosol. The chemical composition of both gaseous and particle emissions were also monitored at different engine loads and were thrust dependent. <b>At</b> <b>idling</b> load (thrust 2. 5 – 7  %), more than 90  % of the secondary particle mass was organic and {{could be explained by}} the oxidation of gaseous aromatic species/ OGs; e. g. benzene, toluene, xylenes, tri-, tetra-, and pentamethyl-benzene and naphthalene. The oxygenated-aromatics, e. g. phenol, furans, were also included in this aromatic fraction and their oxidation could alone explain up to 25  % of the secondary organic particle mass <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> loads. The organic fraction decreased with thrust level, while the inorganic fraction increased. At an approximated cruise load sulfates comprised 85  % of the total secondary particle mass...|$|R

50|$|Even without regulation, {{there are}} strong {{individual}} economic pressures for quieter vehicles, because owners and employers see quieter vehicles as more luxurious and less stressful. The tighter regulatory requirements of the EU and Japan encourage quieter design even in unregulated countries, because most car manufacturers aspire to international sales. On the other hand, individual owners of motorbikes, 'boom-box' cars (with very loud music systems), and 'muscle-cars' may prefer their vehicle to be louder (<b>at</b> least <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> or low speeds), and such noise (often from modified exhaust systems) can only be controlled by on-going inspection and sanctions.|$|R
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
