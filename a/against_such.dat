5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge <b>against</b> <b>such</b> films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Middle Temple {{proposed}} {{selling the}} Molyneux globes, valued at over £1million, {{to create a}} scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority <b>against</b> <b>such</b> a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend <b>against</b> <b>such</b> use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo {{also played}} in the UEFA Cup <b>against</b> <b>such</b> clubs as Bordeaux, Feyenoord, Schalke 04 and Ferencváros, and scored a goal against Portuguese club SC (Sporting Club) Braga.

5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select <b>against</b> <b>such</b> proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E

5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he was now in his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor.

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses <b>against</b> <b>such</b> predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection <b>against</b> <b>such</b> predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship <b>against</b> <b>such</b> heavy odds.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} in August 1949, the U.S. was considering {{a crash course}} to develop a hydrogen bomb. The AEC's nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended unanimously <b>against</b> <b>such</b> a course, and Smyth {{was one of three}} of the five AEC commissioners to agree. Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test.|$|E
5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard <b>against</b> <b>such</b> an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, while {{residing}} at his Wappocomo residence, Casey {{purchased a}} freed slave named John, {{who had been}} residing in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Virginia residents Francis McGuire, Baldwin Parsons, and Absalom Wells seized John and transported him to Virginia, where they sold him back into slavery to Casey. Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society petitioned Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin to demand punishment of the three men by the Governor of Virginia. Virginia's governor refused, citing {{the absence of a}} provision in the United States Constitution calling for such an action. Governor Mifflin petitioned the United States Congress, and a bill was introduced that provided <b>against</b> <b>such</b> an occurrence.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings. North Wales proved to be a special case, as there were concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack on the region. Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend <b>against</b> <b>such</b> an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less of a potential Scottish target, was rendered unusable by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.|$|E
5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard <b>against</b> <b>such</b> abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced <b>against</b> <b>such</b> vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{which started}} the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front {{had come to a}} lull. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders <b>against</b> <b>such</b> an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians. The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.|$|E
