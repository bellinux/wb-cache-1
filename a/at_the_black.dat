5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E
5|$|Georgy Vernadsky even {{identified}} the Oleg of the Schechter Letter with Igor's otherwise anonymous eldest son, whose widow Predslava is {{mentioned in the}} Russo-Byzantine treaty of 944. Alternatively, V. Ya. Petrukhin speculated that Helgu-Oleg of the 940s {{was one of the}} vernacular princes of Chernigov, whose ruling dynasty maintained especially close contacts with Khazaria, as the findings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Grave, a large royal kurgan excavated near Chernigov, seem to testify. However, the academic mainstream has not endorsed either of these theories.|$|E
5|$|Sarria {{continued}} to perform and agitate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Cat until, after some 15years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963.

5|$|Among {{other events}} in the United States that {{have been linked to}} the {{conspiracy}} is the Black Tom explosion when, on the night of 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E

5|$|Students {{initiated}} a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this {{was seen by}} the protesters to {{be an act of}} aggression aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> residents of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E
5|$|Talion, {{a captain}} of Gondor, serves within a {{garrison}} stationed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Gate of Mordor. The garrison is attacked by Sauron's Orc forces led by three Black Númenórean captains: the Hammer of Sauron (John DiMaggio), the Tower of Sauron (JB Blanc), and their leader, the Black Hand of Sauron (Nolan North). Talion, his wife Ioreth (Laura Bailey), and his adult son, Dirhael, are captured and ritually sacrificed by the Black Hand {{in an attempt}} to summon into himself the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor. However, Celebrimbor (who suffers from amnesia due to his centuries as a wraith) instead merges with Talion, preventing him from dying alongside his family. Talion and Celebrimbor then depart to both uncover Celebrimbor's identity—increasing his/their power—and avenge the death of Talion's family.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Baxter is a {{self-employed}} lawyer, Quinn runs a bar, Rick is a {{drug dealer}} who is haunted by a Tikoloshe, and Woody buys black market medicine for local hospitals. Baxter learns that Mackenzie was shot to death, indicating that the CIA operation is shut down. Baxter finds Quinn, who is secretly in contact with Woody. After helping Rick escape after his arrest, the four reunite and enter a British Consulate, only to learn the kill order is still active. They later come across the home of Lazaro (Stanley Townsend), a retired CIA agent. He removes their names from the CIA hit list, but later attempts to kill them as revenge for María, who was a CIA agent herself. Mercedes (Jaime Winstone), who they previously met <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> site prison, kills Lazaro, saving them.|$|E

5|$|When Allen completes his Exorcist {{training}} he {{is sent to}} Black Order headquarters, {{where he}} meets other Exorcists. With his new comrades, he goes with other Exorcists on missions to recover other Innocences scattered around the world. Allen finds people compatible with the Innocence, who become his allies. He fights the Millennium Earl, his army of Akuma and the Noah Family, a group of immortal humans who help the Earl and want to destroy the world. Allen and four other Exorcists are sent to locate and protect Cross, since the Millennium Earl has attacked Exorcist generals in his search for the Heart (the most powerful Innocence). Allen leaves the group to save a traitor from the Black Order, and a Noah (Tyki Mikk) nearly kills him. Allen stays <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Order's Asia Branch headquarters {{to recover from the}} experience.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E

5|$|The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater {{productions}} and the Minnesota Opera is {{a founding}} tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, {{serves as the}} city's convention center. The city {{has contributed to the}} music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. <b>At</b> <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Benoît Delbecq, François Corneloup...) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the Wizard and Path of the King {{share the}} same final level, set <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Gate of Mordor. In a further effort to {{distract}} Sauron from the approach of Frodo and Sam, Gandalf advises that Aragorn and the remaining army marches to the Gates of Mordor as a direct challenge to Sauron, who will send out a vast army to meet them, thus keeping his attention away from Mount Doom. Upon arriving at the Gate, the party are confronted by the Mouth of Sauron (Roger L. Jackson), who tells them that Frodo is dead. They kill him and must then face a massive army of orcs, before fighting the remaining Nazgûl. Not believing Frodo to be dead, they plan to fight {{as long as they}} can, ultimately sacrificing themselves so as to give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for six Black Reel Awards, winning only Best Actress for Palmer.
