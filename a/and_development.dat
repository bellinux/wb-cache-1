40|$|Background: Although {{enterprise}} <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> are {{two distinct}} concepts in the organisational and management literature, the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation {{refers to the}} enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> as a single concept. As a result, many companies have a single policy, strategy and structural arrangements to manage enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> programs <b>and</b> activities, thereby conflating the two concepts. Objectives: The aim of this conceptual article was to propose an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> to show the rationale of keeping enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> as two distinct but related activities. Method: The conceptual article provided {{an overview of the}} policy context regarding enterprise development, followed by a discussion on enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> its complexities. The article drew from the literature on supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> from the supplier adaptation, relational view, and learning and knowledge perspective theories in the development of its argument. Results: The article presented an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> then concluded with some recommendations and direction for future research. Conclusion: The implications of this research have great value for organisations as they prepare to implement Enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> (ESD) programmes. The proposed framework will also contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the ESD process and the link between enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> processes. </p...|$|R
