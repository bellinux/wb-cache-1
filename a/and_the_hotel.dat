5|$|Tesla's unpaid bills, and {{complaints}} about the mess from his pigeon-feeding, forced {{him to leave the}} St. Regis in 1923, the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point, he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.|$|E
5|$|Also {{located in}} {{the eastern end of}} the suburb are Lennox Gardens, the Yarralumla Yacht Club, the Albert Hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Canberra. The Hotel Canberra opened in 1924 to {{accommodate}} politicians when Parliament was in session. The hotel was closed in 1974 and the buildings served as an annexe for Parliament House between 1976 and 1984. The Hyatt Hotel Group re-opened the hotel in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel was}} not immensely {{profitable}} in its opening years; smaller {{than many of}} the new hotels springing up in that period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented by many of the London elite who considered it vulgar. It took £3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> lost over £50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of Elles with manager with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant.|$|E

5|$|With {{proximity}} to Grand Canyon National Park, {{the city also}} has a thriving travel and tourism industry, with numerous hotel and restaurant chains. The downtown area is home to two historic hotels, the Weatherford Hotel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Monte Vista. The first hotel of the Ramada Inn chain opened in 1954 {{at the intersection of}} U.S. Routes 66, 89 and 89A adjacent to what was then Arizona State College (now Northern Arizona University). The original building is still intact, operating as a Super 8 Motel.|$|E
5|$|Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was {{designated}} a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is {{topped with a}} pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof. During the First World War the hotel {{was used as a}} hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home. It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919.|$|E
5|$|During {{a severe}} local {{recession}} in 1985 the 36-year-old hotel, still {{the second largest}} in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> opened its last annual St Patrick's Day party to the public. That evening, some {{people who had been}} at the opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi-formal event in the hotel's Emerald room. A few employees had been with the hotel since its first year of operation. The building was demolished 1 June 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. The Institute of Biosciences and Technology, a component of the Texas A Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{competition}} from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health {{led to the}} decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bolívar <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work {{in one of these}} competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, {{and the top of}} an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's hallway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Inn opened {{formally}} on April 24, 1950, at {{a two-day}} gala which was heavily publicized nationally. Journalists {{from all of}} the major newspapers and magazines were invited, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> paid $5,700 to cover air tickets. 150 invitations were sent out by Clark to VIPs with a credit limit of $10,000. About half the attendees at the opening were from California and Nevada. At the opening show in the Painted Desert Room were performers such as Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Vivian Blaine, Pat Patrick, The Donn Arden Dancers, Van Heflin, Abbott and Costello and the Desert Inn Orchestra, led by Ray Noble. In attendance were a number of mafiosi, including Black Bill Tocco, Joe Massei, Sam Maceo, Peter Licavoli and Frank Malone in a gala which Barbara Greenspun believed marked the beginning of heavy involvement of the mafia in the development of Las Vegas. Sidney Korshak was one of its early investors.|$|E

5|$|The LC station {{began to}} be reconstructed in the late 19th century after several {{properties}} on Buckingham Palace Road, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel,</b> were bought by the company. Work began in 1899 with {{the removal of the}} old roof. The rebuilt station was partially opened on 10 June 1906, with additional platforms and cab exit on 10 February the following year, along with a new annexe to the hotel. It was formally re-opened on 1 July 1908. As a consequence of the rebuilding, boat trains become more popular from Victoria compared to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Services increased to serve Ostend and Calais via Dover and Rotterdam via Gravesend. The LB part of the station also served Dieppe via Newhaven.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E

5|$|Testament to {{the forces}} of globalisation, and growing {{investment}} and influence in the UK by Asians, many of the hotels and establishments on Park Lane are today owned {{by some of the}} wealthiest Middle Eastern and Asian businessmen, sheikhs and sultans. The Dorchester was purchased by the Sultan of Brunei in 1985, and since 1996 {{has been part of the}} Dorchester Collection, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei. The Dorchester Collection connects The Dorchester on Park Lane to other luxury hotels internationally, including The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air of Los Angeles, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hôtel</b> Meurice of Paris. In 1978, a new branch of the Allied Arab Bank opened at 131–2 Park Lane, facilitating the interests of both Arab world and western clients. Mamasino restaurant at 102 Park Lane serves African cuisine and is African-owned. Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at No.45 has been described by GQ Magazine as serving one of the best breakfasts in London, with a mixture of American, European and Asian food.|$|E
