5|$|In this {{championship}} {{version of}} the game, a finish line is set up farther downstream <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>winner</b> <b>is</b> the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live.

5|$|Subsequent {{competitions}} {{have included}} teams from Italy's Serie A, Germany's Bundesliga. Other top-flight Spanish clubs have also occasionally been invited, including Tenerife and Valencia, who were winners in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Since 1997, the competition has only featured a one-off game, the tournament being shortened {{due to an}} increased fixture list and a shorter close season. If the match is tied after 90 minutes, no extra-time is played <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>winner</b> <b>is</b> decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|The Reg Hayter Cup for the NatWest PCA Player of the Year is {{an annual}} cricket award.

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>winner</b> <b>is</b> the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method {{are consistent with the}} Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E

The game then shows one word or phrase, and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match. If players respond to the wrong phrase, they lose money; only the first player to buzz in at the correct time wins and earns money. [...] After seven such phrases, the total scores are added <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>winner</b> <b>is</b> determined.|$|E
