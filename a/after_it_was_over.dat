5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

25|$|The World's Columbian Exposition, {{also known}} as the Chicago World's Fair, was held in 1893. It hosted several world congresses, each dealing with a {{specialized}} topic, such as religion, medicine and science. At almost the last moment, the U.S. Congress decided that the Exposition should also recognize the role of women. <b>After</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> one of the organizers of the Exposition's congress of women revealed that Anthony had played a pivotal but hidden role in that last-minute decision. Fearing that a public campaign would rouse opposition, Anthony had worked quietly to organize support for this project among women of the political elite. Anthony increased the pressure by covertly initiating a petition that was signed by wives and daughters of Supreme Court judges, senators, cabinet members and other dignitaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace talks}} in Paris, the {{viability}} of South Vietnam, of its military and its government, {{and its effect on}} American disengagement, became the prime stories during this period for the news media. The reportage of the Tet/Khe Sanh period had been unique, and <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> reportage settled back into its normal routines. According to Clarence Wyatt, the American disengagement was:like watching a film running backward. American troops were leaving, until there were only a handful of advisers left. The communists were once again on the advance, spreading their influence {{closer and closer to the}} major cities. The South Vietnamese military was once again on the defensive, and the leadership of the nation was isolated and increasingly paranoid... Nixon's goal, like Kennedy's, was for the press to have nothing to report.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} when {{the land in}} Eliot came to be owned by the Farmer family. However, {{they lived in a}} variety of places in New England until, after 1880, when the family moved to Eliot and Moses retired. The home they built in Eliot was called Bittersweat, or Bittersweet-in-the-Fields. Hannah {{established}} a memorial non-segregated service called [...] "Rosemary" [...] as a retreat for unwed or poor mothers and working women in Eliot where, for a donation of $7 ($181 in 2014,) families would have a two-week vacation, up to 40 at a time in 1888. In 1887 Sarah re-animated the Eliot Library Association and set a number of meetings with speakers while also serving as secretary and helping build a list of patrons of the library of some 700 people. Singer Emma Cecilia Thursby recalled her first visit to what was called [...] "Greenacre" [...] was in 1889. Greenacre is and was situated on a bluff overlooking the river which is a mile wide. A group of investors signed a contract to set up a hotel at the cite in 1890 initially called the Eliot Hotel or Inn. In 1891 there were paying customers staying at the Inn. Farmer had an originating idea about a spiritual theme {{for the development of the}} property in June 1892 and then journeyed with her father to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in late 1892 where she met with Swedenborgian Charles Bonney, the [...] "visionary" [...] behind the World's Parliament of Religions, and gained encouragement for her vision for a center of learning for spiritual teachers - an idea blessed by family friends Arthur Wesley Down and John Greenleaf Whittier. Her father died that spring, 1893, and she had to leave before the Parliament took place. She took a brief trip to Norway with Sara Chapman Bull in her grief, and she made it back to the Parliament only in October 1893 <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> Farmer made what she recorded in her diary as a [...] "solemn vow" [...] to building the school for spiritual teachers on 4 February 1894. [...] However, by about 1894 the hotel was called a failure and was boarded up when Farmer approached the investors with the plan to use Greenacre as a place to host lectures on religion. Farmer proposed to her investors to use the closed Inn. By 1897 it was capable of housing 75 or more guests and had a number of cottages around the property with a grassy plain that sometimes hosted a tent camp.|$|E
