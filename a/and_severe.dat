5|$|Anxiety {{reduction}} {{can reduce}} the unpleasantness of pain but is least effective for moderate <b>and</b> <b>severe</b> pain.

5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Depression <b>and</b> <b>Severe</b> Tropical Depression would be changed to Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Storm <b>and</b> <b>Severe</b> Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), <b>and</b> <b>severe</b> (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E

Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
