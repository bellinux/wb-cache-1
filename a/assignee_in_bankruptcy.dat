50|$|Born in London on 27 June 1839, he was {{youngest}} son of William Bell, a merchant of Aldersgate Street who was subsequently official <b>assignee</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> Educated at private schools, and apprenticed in 1855 to Messrs. Wren & Hopkinson, engineers, of Manchester, {{he was taken}} on in 1859 by James Brunlees.|$|E
5000|$|In 1853, {{after the}} death of Dobson, Huntingtower's <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> sued to {{overturn}} the mortgage on the estates and recover the policies, and were successful in having the transaction nullifed by the Court of Chancery as a fraud upon Lord Huntingtower. In this year, he was again confronted by his mistress, Elizabeth Acford, who had learned of his marriage to Katherine Burke. In the following year, he agreed to pay Acford an annuity of 60 pounds in return for the surrender of his remaining letters. Huntingtower now resumed relations with her, and she bore two more children by Huntingtower: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shareholders}} then petitioned Parliament in February 1733, and the House of Commons enquired {{at length}} into the matter. In March, an Act was passed to [...] "encourage and compel George Robinson and John Thomson (sic) to appear ... and disclose the effects" [...] of the Charitable Corporation [...] A Royal Proclamation {{was made on}} 17 March for apprehending Burroughs and Squire with a reward of £500 from the Treasury. [...] The <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> advertised a reward {{for those who would}} disclose his effects, reminding them of the penalty in that Act for not doing so.|$|R
50|$|Sir Thomas Plumer {{gave his}} broker, Mr Walsh, a draft on his bankers for £22,200 {{to invest in}} {{exchequer}} bills. Mr Walsh cashed the draft, and got bank notes. He bought £6500 in exchequer bills, and with the balance he got American securities, paying with the bank notes. But he gave one note to his brother in law, in return for his bankers’ draft of £500. He then bought 71½ doubloons, {{with the intention of}} escaping to North America, via Lisbon. Sir Thomas' attorney caught him at Falmouth, and secured a return of the American securities and bullion. Mr Walsh was indicted, tried, found guilty, but pardoned, and then declared bankrupt. His <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> brought an action in trover against Sir Thomas.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Saint Stephen, New Brunswick, the son of George Stilman Hill, who had {{previously}} served in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. He studied law and was admitted to practice as an attorney in 1854. Hill entered business as a merchant later that same year. He opposed Confederation. He was the Official <b>Assignee</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> for the county from 1869 to 1878. He {{was named to the}} Legislative Council in 1882. Hill was named speaker for the council in 1887. He remained a member of the council until it was abolished in 1892. He died in 1910.|$|E
50|$|He {{attended}} the academies at Plainfield, Connecticut and Westerly, Rhode Island. He moved to New York {{and settled in}} Albion, N.Y., in 1824. He was employed as a clerk until 1826, when he engaged in mercantile pursuits. He assisted in establishing the Bank of Albion in 1839 and served as cashier. He was Treasurer of Orleans County in 1840 and was <b>Assignee</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> for Orleans County in 1841. He was Supervisor of the Town of Barre in 1845, and was elected as a Whig to the 31st and 32nd United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849 to March 4, 1853.|$|E
5000|$|Parliament quickly {{passed an}} act to compel Robinson and Thomson to appear, or {{be guilty of}} a felony. [...] The Commons {{appointed}} a Committee to investigate, and this produced a detailed report on the affair. [...] At {{the end of the}} session, two further Acts were passed. One appointed Commissioners to determine the rights of the shareholders and creditors; for the Charitable Corporation to appoint an <b>assignee</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in respect of Thomson and Robinson, and to compel John Thomson. the warehouse keeper's father to appear before the commissioners in England on pain of being declared a felon. The other required Sutton, Grant, Bond, Burroughs, Wooley and Warren to deliver particulars of their estates to the Barons of the Exchequer. William Squire was required to surrender himself and do the same, while Burroughs was committed to the Fleet Prison until he complied. [...] All of them (except Squires) delivered inventories accordingly, and they were printed by order of the Commons Committee. [...] It is probable that Squire remained abroad, as no further reference to him occurs in the London Gazette.|$|E
60|$|In statistics, it {{is evident}} that {{empirical}} laws may sometimes be traced; and the tracing them forms an important part of that system of indirect observation on which we must often rely for the data of the Deductive Science. The process of the science consists in inferring effects from their causes; but we have often no means of observing the causes, except through the medium of their effects. In such cases the deductive science is unable to predict the effects, for want of the necessary data; it can determine what causes are capable of producing any given effect, but not with what frequency and in what quantities those causes exist. An instance in point is afforded by a newspaper now lying before me. A statement was furnished by one of the official <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> showing among the various bankruptcies which it had been his duty to investigate, in how many cases the losses had been caused by misconduct of different kinds, and in how many by unavoidable misfortunes. The result was, that the number of failures caused by misconduct greatly preponderated over those arising from all other causes whatever. Nothing but specific experience could have given sufficient ground for a conclusion to this purport. To collect, therefore, such empirical laws (which are never more than approximate generalizations) from direct observation, {{is an important part of}} the process of sociological inquiry.|$|R

50|$|Arbuthnot & Co had two {{partners}} {{at the time}} of its failure, namely Sir George Gough Arbuthnot and J.M. Young, a salaried partner who seems to have had no voice in the running of the firm. The firm entered into an arrangement with Patrick Macfadyen who operated P Macfadyen & Co which was effectively Arbuthnot's London branch. Macfadyen engaged in speculation, in the process losing huge amounts of the firm's money. Prior to its collapse, Arbuthnots employed between 11,000 and 12,000 people, had 7,000 creditors and £1,000,000 in liabilities. It was ascertained that the liabilities of Macfadyen's were £400,000 and there were 1,000 creditors. It was agreed by the English trustee <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and the official <b>assignee</b> <b>in</b> Madras that the assets of the two insolvent firms were to be treated as one and the same business, all creditors were to be entitled to share rateably in the pooled assets.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} quarter of 1906, Madras (now Chennai) was hit by the worst {{financial}} crisis the city was ever to suffer. Of the three best-known British commercial names in 19th century Madras, one crashed; a second had to be resurrected by a distress sale; and the third had to be bailed out by a benevolent benefactor. Macfadyen, one of the partners, engaged in speculation, in the process losing huge amounts of the firm's money. Prior to its collapse, Arbuthnots employed between 11,000 and 12,000 people, had 7,000 creditors and £1,000,000 in liabilities.

40|$|Context In GitHub, {{an issue}} or a pull request can be {{assigned}} to a specific assignee {{who is responsible for}} working on this issue or pull request. Due to the principle of voluntary participation, available assignees may remain inactive <b>in</b> projects. If <b>assignees</b> ever participate <b>in</b> projects, they are active assignees; otherwise, they are inactive yet available assignees (inactive assignees for short). Objective Our objective in this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of inactive yet available <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> GitHub. Method We collect 2, 374, 474 records of activities in 37 popular projects, and 797, 756 records of activities in 687 projects belonging to 8 organizations. We compute the percentage of inactive <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> projects, and compare projects with and without inactive assignees. Then we analyze datasets to explore why some assignees are inactive. Finally, we send questionnaires to understand impacts of inactive assignees. Results We find that some projects have high percentage of inactive yet available assignees. For example, 66. 35 % of <b>assignees</b> never participate <b>in</b> the project paperclip. The project paperclip belongs to the organization thoughtbot. In the organization thoughtbot, 84. 4 % of projects have more than 80 % of inactive assignees. We further observe that the main reason for developers being inactive assignees is that developers work for organizations and automatically become available assignees of some projects in the organizations. However, these developers do not work on projects. 37. 25 % of developers that we have surveyed agree that inactive assignees affect open source software development (i. e., causing unresolved issues or pull requests, and delaying software development). Conclusion Some organizations should improve team management, and carefully select developers to become <b>assignees</b> <b>in</b> projects. Future studies about assignees should be careful to perform data cleaning, since some available assignees are added by virtue of their employment and do not really work on projects...|$|R
