5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> {{state line}} in South Valley, PA346 exits the Allegheny National Forest and becomes NY280 upon {{entering}} New York. The route heads {{north along the}} eastern edge of the Allegheny Reservoir as East Bank Perimeter Road, clipping the southwestern corner of Allegany State Park prior to entering the Allegany Indian Reservation. NY280 passes in and out of the park once more before turning to the east toward Quaker Lake as it enters the town of Coldspring. At Quaker Lake, NY280 penetrates the park boundary once more and intersects Allegany State Park Route3 (ASP Route3) at the Quaker Run entrance. Here, NY280 turns north, traversing a small waterway separating Quaker Lake from the reservoir before reentering the Allegany Indian Reservation limits.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His {{earliest}} pattern coins designed {{during his tenure}} at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled as a student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare {{to create a new}} Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.|$|E
5|$|NY474 begins <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> {{state line}} {{in the town of}} French Creek as a {{continuation}} of PA474, which in turn begins a short distance west of the state line in Wattsburg, Pennsylvania. NY474 heads east through rural southwest Chautauqua County, briefly paralleling French Creek to the hamlet of Marvin before intersecting and briefly overlapping with NY426 through the small hamlet of Cutting. NY474 exits Cutting and continues on an easterly track into the town of Clymer and the hamlet of the same name, where it meets County Route15 (CR15), a local road leading from the Pennsylvania state line (where the road continues south to Corry) north to Sherman {{in the center of the}} community.|$|E

5|$|The route was {{assigned}} {{in the early}} 1940s, replacing New York State Route17D, a route established {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally began in downtown Elmira and ended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> state line in Chemung. NY427 was realigned on its east end in 1967 to meet the newly constructed exit59 on NY17 and on its west end in 1978 to follow what had been New York State Route379 through the town of Southport. Other minor realignments have occurred over the years as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Blaine {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only eighteen years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy life in his adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two were married. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine’s family in Augusta, Maine for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851. The young family soon moved again, this time to Philadelphia where Blaine took a job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Institution for the Instruction of the Blind (now Overbrook School for the Blind) in 1852, teaching science and literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with MD 97 to replace the section between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border, where it would connect to PA 97. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. On January 1, 1979, MD 97 was rerouted at Westminster to head north to the Pennsylvania border, replacing US 140. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> border, the route connected to PA 97, which replaced the US 140 designation in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the former alignment of MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg became a part of MD 140. Dualization of MD 97 in Montgomery County was extended further north from MD 28 to MD 108 by 1989. There are plans to build an interchange at the route’s intersection with Randolph Road in order to improve movements for automobiles as well as for pedestrians and bicycles accessing the nearby Glenmont Metro station. Another new interchange was built with MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) north of MD 28 and opened on February 23, 2011.|$|E

5|$|MD 30 {{enters the}} town of Manchester as Main Street as the highway passes by Manchester Valley High School. In the center of town, the highway intersects Westminster Street and York Street; along the latter street is Charlotte's Quest Nature Center. MD 30 meets the {{northern}} end of MD 27 (Manchester Road) on the northern edge of downtown and the southern end of MD 86 (Lineboro Road) at the north town limit. There is no direct access from southbound MD 30 to northbound MD 86; that movement is made via Hallie Avenue, the next intersection to the south. MD 30 crosses Dug Hill Ridge just north of MD 86 and passes through the community of Melrose, where the highway intersects MD 496 (Bachmans Valley Road) and Wentz Road. The state highway follows {{the upper reaches of the}} South Branch of Gunpowder Falls through a ridge to the river's source before reaching its northern terminus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> state line.

5|$|That year, H.D. {{attended}} Bryn Mawr College {{to study}} Greek literature, but left after only three terms due to poor grades and the excuse of poor health. While at the college, she met poets Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams. Her first published writings, stories for children, {{were published in}} The Comrade, a Philadelphia Presbyterian Church paper, between 1909 and 1913, mostly under the name Edith Gray. In 1907, she became engaged to Pound. Her father disapproved of Pound, {{and by the time}} Pound left for Europe in 1908, the engagement had been called off. Around this time, H.D. started a relationship with a young female art student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Academy of Fine Arts, Frances Josepha Gregg. After spending part of 1910 living in Greenwich Village, she sailed to Europe with Gregg and Gregg's mother in 1911. In Europe, H.D. began a more serious career as a writer. Her relationship with Gregg cooled, and she met a writing enthusiast named Brigit Patmore with whom she became involved in an affair. Patmore introduced H.D. to another poet, Richard Aldington.|$|E
5|$|MD 213 enters Elkton at the {{intersection}} with US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Past this intersection, the route heads northwest on Bridge Street, passing through commercial areas. The route intersects Main Street, which continues east of MD 213 as a one-way street eastbound. Past Main Street, the road continues north and passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor before intersecting MD 545 (Elkton Boulevard). MD 213 continues past commercial areas {{to the west and}} residential areas to the east before its intersection with MD 279 (Elkton Road/Newark Avenue). Past the MD 279 intersection, the route leaves Elkton and becomes Singerly Road, which continues past residences. MD 213 enters a mix of woods and farms and passes over Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision within a short distance of each other. It continues through a mix of farms and residences before the road reaches the Leeds roundabout with Leeds Road. Past the roundabout, the route resumes north, intersecting MD 273 (Telegraph Road) in Fair Hill west of the Fair Hill Training Center, where the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway leaves MD 213 and heads west along MD 273. From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> border.
