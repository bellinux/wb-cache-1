Wu progressively gained influence over the governance of the empire throughout Emperor Gaozong's reign, and eventually she effectively was making the major decisions. She was regarded as ruthless in her endeavours to grab power and was believed by traditional historians even to have killed her own daughter to frame Empress Wang (and, later, her own eldest son Li Hong), in a power struggle.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins {{was away}} on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic {{mathematics}} that make possible a {{general theory of}} how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin {{ended up with the}} DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.|$|E

25|$|The Rumlu, Afshar, and the Qajar clan favored Ismail Mirza Safavi, who {{was jailed}} in the Qahqaheh Castle. Pari Khan Khanum also favored Ismail Mirza, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{support of the}} Circassians. While Tahmasp was still ill, those who {{supported}} Haydar Mirza, {{sent a message to}} the castellan of Qahqaheh Castle, named Khalifa Ansar Qaradghlu. They requested him to have Ismail Mirza killed. However, Pari Khan Khanum managed to find out about it and told Tahmasp about the plot. Tahmasp, who still had some feelings for Ismail Mirza due to the courage he used to have in the encounters with the Ottoman Empire, sent a group of Afshar musketeers to the Qahqaheh Castle to safeguard him. Two months later, Tahmasp healed from the life-threatening illness he had. Two years later, on 14 May 1576, he died in Qazvin. Haydar Mirza was the only son who was with him when he died, and thus the following day, he announced himself as the new shah. Normally, some Qizilbash tribes would guard the royal palace and take turns with other others—unfortunately for Haydar Mirza, on that day all the Qizilbash guards were either from the Rumlu, Afshar, Qajar, Bayat, or the Dorsaq tribe—all loyal supporters of Ismail Mirza.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, {{her mother}} Lady Yang {{had been created}} the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her {{brothers}} Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating {{that they did not}} find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu therefore requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures—outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace—possibly as a concubine—but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made, and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.|$|E

[...] "It was bitter and hard to face life anew," [...] she wrote later. Using the name E. G. Smith, she vanished from public life and took {{on a series of}} private nursing jobs. [...] When the US Congress passed the Anarchist Exclusion Act, however, a new wave of activism rose to oppose it, pulling Goldman back into the movement.

2500|$|In 1554, at age twenty-two, Anguissola {{traveled}} to Rome, where {{she spent her}} time sketching various scenes and people.

When he made a request for her to draw a weeping boy, Anguissola drew Boy Bitten by a Crayfish and sent it back to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent.

For at least two years, Anguissola continued this informal study, receiving substantial guidance from Michelangelo.|$|E
