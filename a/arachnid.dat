5|$|In 2014, two Brazilian zoologists {{described}} {{a new species}} of <b>arachnid</b> called Taito spaceinvaders Kury & Barros, 2014, inspired in the game because of the resemblance of a fleck in the dorsal scutum of the animal with the typical alien of the game.|$|E
5|$|After Chamberlin's death, his {{collection}} of some 250,000 spider specimens was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, bolstering the museum's status as the world's largest <b>arachnid</b> repository. Similarly, {{his collection}} of millipedes was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., helping to make that museum the world's largest single collection of millipede type specimens—the individual specimens used to describe species.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other <b>arachnid</b> groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the eyes, almost all <b>arachnids</b> have two other types of sensory organs. The most important to most <b>arachnids</b> are the fine sensory hairs that cover the body and give the animal its sense of touch. These can be relatively simple, but many <b>arachnids</b> also possess more complex structures, called trichobothria.|$|R
25|$|The {{excretory}} glands of <b>arachnids</b> include {{up to four}} {{pairs of}} coxal glands {{along the side of}} the prosoma, and one or two pairs of Malpighian tubules, emptying into the gut. Many <b>arachnids</b> have only one or the other type of excretory gland, although several do have both. The primary nitrogenous waste product in <b>arachnids</b> is guanine.|$|R
50|$|Arachnology is the {{scientific}} study of spiders and related animals such as scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and harvestmen, collectively called <b>arachnids.</b> Those who study spiders and other <b>arachnids</b> are arachnologists.|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} of harvestmen with other <b>arachnid</b> orders {{is still not}} sufficiently resolved.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 98,000 <b>arachnid</b> species have been described, and {{that there may be}} up to 600,000 in total.|$|E
25|$|Two {{specialized}} {{terms are}} useful in describing views of <b>arachnid</b> legs and pedipalps. Prolateral refers {{to the surface of}} a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid's body. Retrolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid's body.|$|E
50|$|The order Ricinulei is a {{group of}} <b>arachnids</b> known as hooded tickspiders, though they are not true spiders. Like most <b>arachnids,</b> they are predatory, eating small arthropods. In older works they are {{sometimes}} referred to as Podogona.|$|R
50|$|The oldest book lungs {{have been}} {{recovered}} from extinct trigonotarbid <b>arachnids</b> preserved in the 410-million-year-old Rhynie chert of Scotland. These Devonian fossil lungs are almost indistinguishable from the lungs of modern <b>arachnids,</b> fully adapted to a terrestrial existence.|$|R
50|$|The Great Cataclysm: {{result of}} a failed genetic experiment, which ruined the Civilization of the Ancients on Symbion. Insects and <b>arachnids</b> grew to {{frightening}} proportions; Humans took {{on the characteristics of}} <b>arachnids</b> and insects, with the Sectaurs as the results.|$|R
25|$|Phalangiotarbi is an extinct <b>arachnid</b> order known {{exclusively}} from the Palaeozoic (Devonian to Permian) of Europe and North America. The affinities of phalangiotarbids are obscure, with most authors favouring affinities with Opiliones (harvestmen) and/or Acari (mites and ticks). Phalangiotarbi has been recently proposed to be sister group to (Palpigradi+Tetrapulmonata): the taxon Megoperculata sensu Shultz (1990).|$|E
25|$|The subdivisions of the arachnids {{are usually}} treated as orders. Historically, mites and ticks {{were treated as}} a single order, Acari. However, {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{studies suggest that the}} two groups do not form a single clade, with morphological similarities being due to convergence. They are now usually treated as two separate taxa – Acariformes, mites, and Parasitiformes, ticks – which may be ranked as orders or superorders. The <b>arachnid</b> subdivisions are listed below alphabetically; numbers of species are approximate.|$|E
25|$|The walking legs again {{follow the}} typical <b>arachnid</b> plan with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, {{metatarsus}} and tarsus. The coxae surround a single sternum. In well preserved palaeocharinids {{there is a}} ring, or annulus, around the trochanter–femur joint {{which may be the}} remains of an earlier leg segment. The legs are largely unmodified, although in Anthracosironidae the forelegs are quite large and spiny, presumably to help catch prey. The legs end in three claws, two large ones and a smaller median claw.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arachnids</b> usually lay yolky eggs, which hatch into immatures that {{resemble}} adults. Scorpions, however, are either ovoviviparous or viviparous, depending on species, and bear live young. In most <b>arachnids</b> only the females provide parental care, with harvestmen {{being one of}} the few exceptions.|$|R

25|$|<b>Arachnid</b> {{blood is}} {{variable}} in composition, {{depending on the}} mode of respiration. Arachnids with an efficient tracheal system {{do not need to}} transport oxygen in the blood, and may have a reduced circulatory system. In scorpions and some spiders, however, the blood contains haemocyanin, a copper-based pigment with a similar function to haemoglobin in vertebrates. The heart is located in the forward part of the abdomen, and {{may or may not be}} segmented. Some mites have no heart at all.|$|E
25|$|Net-casting spiders of genus Deinopis {{have their}} {{posterior}} median eyes enlarged into large forward-facing compound lenses. These eyes {{have a wide}} field of view {{and are able to}} gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls. This is {{despite the fact that they}} lack a tapetum lucidum; instead, each night a large area of light sensitive membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since <b>arachnid</b> eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids produce {{digestive}} juices {{in their}} stomachs, {{and use their}} pedipalps and chelicerae to pour them over their dead prey. The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients, which the <b>arachnid</b> sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately {{in front of the}} mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, sclerotised pharynx, which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the oesophagus and stomach. In some arachnids, the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump.|$|E

25|$|The <b>arachnid</b> {{collection}} {{is considered the}} third-largest in Brazil (the second-largest {{in the number of}} type-specimens), with nearly 32,000 lots (an increase of more than 56 percent over the 18,000 lots catalogued in 2000) primarily preserved in ethanol. Three-quarters of the lots are spiders and one-fifth are harvestmen from Brazil. There are nearly 600 primary type specimens, of which 60 percent are spiders and 28 percent are harvestmen. The collection began with specimens collected by researchers and travelling naturalists during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The {{collection is}} curated by zoologist Ricardo Pinto-da-Rocha.|$|E
25|$|The pedipalps {{have the}} typical <b>arachnid</b> {{structure}} with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia and tarsus. They are pediform, i.e. {{they look like}} small legs and were not modified into pincers. There is no evidence for a special sperm transfer device as in the modified palpal organ of male spiders. Interestingly, in at least the palaeocharinids and anthracomartids {{the tip of the}} pedipalp is modified into a small claw formed from the tarsal claw (or apotele) and a projection from the tarsus. As mentioned above, a very similar arrangement is seen {{at the end of the}} pedipalp in Ricinulei.|$|E
25|$|The water mite Neumania papillator (known in {{behavioral}} ecology {{as an example}} of sensory bias) is another <b>arachnid</b> ambush predator that uses vibrational stimuli in hunting - males and females perch among the fronds of aquatic vegetation in a characteristic stance termed the 'net stance' - their first four legs are held out into the water column, with their four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation. This allows them to detect vibrational stimuli produced by swimming copepods, small crustaceans on whom which they prey - N. papillator then uses this information to orient towards and clutch at their prey.|$|E

25|$|In 1892, Ferdinand Karsch {{suggested}} that the rare and rather bizarre looking ricinuleids (Ricinulei) were the last living descendants of the trigonotarbids. A similar hypothesis was reintroduced by Dunlop, who pointed out distinct similarities between these <b>arachnid</b> groups. Both have opisthosomal tergites divided into median and lateral plates and both have a complicated coupling mechanism between the prosoma and the opisthosoma which 'locks' {{the two halves of}} the body together. Although cladistic analysis has tended to recover ricinuleids in their traditional position closely related to mites and ticks, further discoveries have revealed that the tip of the pedipalp ends in a small claw in both trigonotarbids and ricinuleids.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} is when {{a female}} cannibalizes her mate prior to, during, or after copulation. It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most <b>arachnid</b> orders, {{as well as several}} insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression.|$|E
25|$|Like Rex, Roman has a bionic arm, {{which he}} uses to trigger explosives. He is {{defeated}} by Yusei, but before he dies, he triggers an explosion that sends Yusei down into the pool Ener-D. His deck focuses around Spider type monsters, and specializes in changing an opponent's monster into defense mode to obtain counters for summoning his Earthbound Immortal Uru. Uru can control an opponent's monster by sacrificing one of his own. Roman is later defeated by Yusei, but he sets off an explosive in his mechanical arm before crumbling to dust, so that Yusei would fall into {{the gate to the}} Netherworld. His spirit remains in the world until Goodwin is defeated, at which point Roman joins his brother in the afterlife. His ace is the Dark Synchro Underground <b>Arachnid.</b>|$|E
