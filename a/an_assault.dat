5|$|<b>An</b> <b>assault</b> is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|Blake v Barnard {{established}} {{a rule that}} conditional threats could not amount to <b>an</b> <b>assault.</b> However, the court's reliance on Tuberville v Savage was tenuous at best. Such threats would normally be considered assault.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, aerial {{reconnaissance}} near Mont Sorrel indicated that German forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> was intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> of their own.|$|E
5|$|A British assault force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk <b>an</b> <b>assault.</b> Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for <b>an</b> <b>assault,</b> the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
