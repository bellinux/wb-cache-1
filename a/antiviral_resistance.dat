5000|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{the ability}} of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them. [...] This broader term also covers antibiotic resistance, which applies to bacteria and antibiotics. Resistance arises through one of three ways: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations; or more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials. Resistant microbes are increasingly difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses, both of which may be more expensive or more toxic. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant (MDR); or sometimes superbugs. Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise with millions of deaths every year. All classes of microbes develop resistance: fungi develop antifungal resistance, viruses develop <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance,</b> protozoa develop antiprotozoal resistance, and bacteria develop antibiotic resistance.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{potential}} for emergence of <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance</b> during influenza pandemics has raised great concern for public health. Widespread use of antiviral drugs {{is a significant}} factor in producing resistant strains. Recent studies show that some influenza viruses may gain <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance</b> without a fitness penalty. This creates the possibility of strategic interaction between populations considering antiviral drug use strategies. Methods: To explain why, we develop and analyze a classical 2 -player game theoretical model where each player chooses from a range of possible rates of antiviral drug use, and payoffs are derived as a function of final size of epidemic with the regular and mutant strain. Final sizes are derived from a stochastic compartmental epidemic model that captures transmission within each population and between populations, and the stochastic emergence of <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance.</b> High treatment levels not only increase the spread of the resistant strain in the subject population but also affect the other population by increasing the density of the resistant strain infectious individuals due to travel between populations. Results: We found two Nash equilibria where both populations treat at a high rate, or both treat at a low rate. Hence the game theoretical analysis predicts that populations will not choose different treatment strategies than other populations, under these assumptions. The populations may choose to cooperate by maintaining a low treatment rate that does not increase the incidence of mutant strain infections or cause case importations to the other population. Alternatively, if one population is treating at a high rate, this will generate a large number of mutant infections that spread to the other population, in turn incentivizing that population to also treat at a high rate. The prediction of two separate Nash equilibria is robust to the mutation rate and the effectiveness of the drug in preventing transmission, but it is sensitive to the volume of travel between the two populations. Conclusions: Model-based evaluations of antiviral influenza drug use during a pandemic usually consider populations in isolation from one another, but our results show that strategic interactions could strongly influence a population's choice of antiviral drug use policy. Furthermore, the high treatment rate Nash equilibrium has the potential to become socially suboptimal (i. e. non-Pareto optimal) under model assumptions that might apply under other conditions. Because of the need for players to coordinate their actions, we conclude that communication and coordination between jurisdictions during influenza pandemics is a priority, especially for influenza strains that do not evolve a fitness penalty under <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance.</b> Keywords: Game theory, Stochastic compartmental model, <b>Antiviral</b> drugs, Drug <b>resistance,</b> H 1 N 1, Fitness penalt...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{study of}} human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance</b> has enhanced knowledge of the virological targets and the mechanisms of antiviral activity. The currently approved drugs, ganciclovir (GCV), foscarnet (FOS), and cidofovir (CDV), target the viral DNA polymerase. GCV anabolism also requires phosphorylation by the virus-encoded UL 97 kinase. GCV resistance mutations {{have been identified in}} both genes, while FOS and CDV mutations occur only in the DNA polymerase gene. Confirmation of resistance mutations requires phenotypic analysis; however, phenotypic assays are too time-consuming for diagnostic purposes. Genotypic assays based on sequencing provide more rapid results but are dependent on prior validation by phenotypic methods. Reports from many laboratories have produced an evolving list of confirmed resistance mutations, although differences in interpretation have led to some confusion. Recombinant phenotyping methods performed in a few research laboratories have resolved some of the conflicting results.

50|$|All three {{currently}} licensed anti-HCMV drugs {{target the}} viral DNA polymerase, pUL54. Ganciclovir (GCV) acts as nucleoside analogue. Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the HCMV protein kinase, pUL97. The second drug, Cidofovir (CDV), is a nucleotide analogue, {{which is already}} phosphorylated and thus active. Finally, Foscarnet (FOS) has a different mode of action. It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the pyrophosphate binding site of pUL54 (note: investigational drug letermovir acts through a mechanism that involves viral terminase).Two HCMV proteins are implicated in <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> against these three drugs: pUL97 and pUL54. Specific mutations in pUL97 can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase. Thus, fewer monophosphorylated - and thus active - GCV can be synthesized, leading to <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> against GCV. About 90% of all GCV resistances are caused by such mutations in UL97. Mutations in pUL54 may have different effects leading to antiviral drug resistance: A. They can lead to decreased affinity to antiviral compounds. This resistance mechanism concerns GCV, CDV and FOS and may lead to multidrug resistance. B. Some mutations in pUL54 can increase the polymerase’s exonuclease activity. This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV. As a result, these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently.Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the host’s immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication.HCMV antiviral drug resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing. Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations {{in order to determine}} EC50 values. In contrast, genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL97 and UL54 by sequencing. Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster, but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation. This can be performed via a web-based search tool that links a patient’s HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL97 and UL54 mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes.|$|E

Vaccination and antiviral treatments are the sole and essential way for the prevention and control of influenza infection. During an influenza epidemic before the production of effective vaccine, antiviral treatments are the first step for the prevention and treatment of influenza infection. Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors are influenza antiviral drugs. Because of the increase of drug resistant viruses, the aim of this study was the evaluation of the <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistance</b> in influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses from 2005 - 2013 in Iran. Methods: In this study 50 influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses isolated in cell culture were tested. All samples were subjected to M and NA gene sequencing at the National Influenza Center, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. RNA was ex-tracted from 200 µl of cell culture supernatants using the Roche high pure viral nucleic acid kit. RT-PCR with the Qiagen one step RT-PCR kit was done. The expected size of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1 % agarose gels. The PCR products were sequenced for finding the drug resistant mutants. Results: All influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses except four viruses circulating during 2005 - 2006 had Ser 31 Asn mutation at M 2 channel protein.

MSCSA and Sanger sequencing results revealed a high concordance (nucleotides > 99 %, SNPs ∼ 94 %). Virulence or resistance markers were not detected in routine surveillance specimens: all identified SNPs encoded for silent mutations or non-relevant amino acid substitutions. In a second study population, the presence of H 275 Y oseltamivir resistant virus was identified by real-time PCR in 19 of 35 clinical <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> monitoring specimens obtained from 4 immunocompromised patients with ≥ 14 days prolonged pH 1 N 1 excretion.

40|$|Abstract Background Antivirals play a {{critical}} role in the prevention and the management of influenza. One class of antivirals, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), is effective against all human influenza viruses. Currently there are two NAI drugs which are licensed worldwide: oseltamivir (Tamiflu ®) and zanamivir (Relenza ®); and two drugs which have received recent approval in Japan: peramivir and laninamivir. Until recently, the prevalence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> has been relatively low. However, almost all seasonal H 1 N 1 strains that circulated in 2008 - 09 were resistant to oseltamivir whereas about 1 % of tested 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 viruses were found to be resistant to oseltamivir. To date, no studies have demonstrated widespread resistance to zanamivir. It seems likely that the literature on <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> associated with oseltamivir as well as zanamivir is now sufficiently comprehensive to warrant a systematic review. The primary objectives were to systematically review the literature to determine the incidence of resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir in different population groups as well as assess the clinical consequences of <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance.</b> Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE without language restrictions in September 2010 to identify studies reporting incidence of resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. We used forest plots and meta-analysis of incidence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> associated with the three NAIs. Subgroup analyses were done across a number of population groups. Meta-analysis was also performed to evaluate associations between <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> and clinical complications and symptoms. Results We identified 19 studies reporting incidence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance.</b> Meta-analysis of 15 studies yielded a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2. 6 % (95 %CI 0. 7 % to 5. 5 %). The incidence rate for all zanamivir resistance studies was 0 %. Only one study measured incidence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistance</b> among subjects given peramivir and was reported to be 0 %. Subgroup analyses detected higher incidence rates among influenza A patients, especially for H 1 N 1 subtype influenza. Considerable heterogeneity between studies precluded definite inferences about subgroup results for immunocompromised patients, in-patients, and children. A meta-analysis of 4 studies reporting association between oseltamivir-resistance and pneumonia yielded a statistically significant risk ratio of 4. 2 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 13. 1, p = 0. 02). Oseltamivir-resistance was not statistically significantly associated with other clinical complications and symptoms. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that that a substantial number of patients may become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use, and that oseltamivir resistance may be significantly associated with pneumonia. In contrast, zanamivir resistance has been rarely reported to date. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{therapy is}} a main method to control chronic hepatitis B and prevent cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. However，the efficacy of current antiviral drugs are unsatisfactory. In order {{to optimize the}} antiviral strategy, {{it is worthy to}} investigate an important choice to combine antiviral drugs of different antiviral mechanism or different <b>antiviral</b> drug <b>resistances.</b> Although some relative studies and evidences have been taken, there are still many problems and arguments about combination therapy, which needs deep understanding of the pathogenesis and mechanism of poor antiviral response...|$|R
40|$|In this review, I {{describe}} the available assays for detecting resistance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to antivirals and emphasize the practical {{utility of the}} genotypic approach. The indications for such testing and the contraindications are discussed, as are the interpretation of results and the evidence of cross-resistance between <b>antivirals.</b> <b>Resistance</b> of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to antivirals was a major clinical problem in patients with AIDS, but {{with the advent of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), CMV retinitis and its treatment in patients with AIDS has become rare in the developed world. However, CMV infection remains a major problem in transplantation, and <b>resistance</b> to <b>antivirals</b> is encoun-tered in all forms of transplantation. In solid-organ transplantation, ganciclovir resistance is largely found among donor-positive, recipient-negative lung, kidney, and kidney/pancreas recipients, whereas for stem cell recipients, it is found in the recipient-positive group [1 – 5]. Other risk factors include T cell depletion, pro-longed antiviral exposure (duration, 13 months), very high viral loads, multiple episodes of CMV disease, more intensive immunosuppression, and suboptimal antiviral drug concentrations due to reduced absorp-tion or poor compliance. Resistance to foscarnet and cidofovir has also been reported in solid-organ and stem cell transplant recipients [6 – 11]. This review de-scribes the assays available for resistance testing and the interpretation of their results...|$|R
40|$|Productive {{infection}} by herpesviruses {{involve the}} disabling of host-cell intrinsic defenses by viral encoded tegument proteins. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) typically establishes a non-productive, latent infection {{and it remains}} unclear how it confronts the host-cell intrinsic defenses that restrict viral gene expression. Here, we show that the EBV major tegument protein BNRF 1 targets host-cell intrinsic defense proteins and promotes viral early gene activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that BNRF 1 interacts with the host nuclear protein Daxx at PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and disrupts {{the formation of the}} Daxx-ATRX chromatin remodeling complex. We mapped the Daxx interaction domain on BNRF 1, and show that this domain is important for supporting EBV primary infection. Through reverse transcription PCR and infection assays, we show that BNRF 1 supports viral gene expression upon early infection, and that this function is dependent on the Daxxinteraction domain. Lastly, we show that knockdown of Daxx and ATRX induces reactivation of EBV from latently infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), suggesting that Daxx and ATRX {{play a role in the}} regulation of viral chromatin. Taken together, our data demonstrate an important role of BNRF 1 in supporting EBV early infection by interacting with Daxx and ATRX; and suggest that tegument disruption of PML-NB-associated <b>antiviral</b> <b>resistances</b> is a universal requirement fo...|$|R
