40|$|Abstract. It {{provides}} {{a new way}} to solve the worldwide the low-temperature cracking and high temperature rutting distresses of the asphalt pavement, by mixing the composite shape-stabilized phase change material (CSPCM) to <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture.</b> The effect of CSPCM on the temperature of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> is analyzed by the monotonic cooling test, the monotonic heating test and the outdoor simulating cycle test. The results of monotonic cooling and heating tests indicate that mixing CSPCM into <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> can increase the temperature of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> during cooling process and decrease the temperature of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> during heating process.
