50|$|The CASPA {{application}} service launched in 2001 with 68 participating physician assistant programs, and mailed over 16,000 applications to its member schools. The original service {{consisted of the}} CASPA Applicant Portal, which interfaced with students, and the CASPA Admissions Portal, or PA Admit, an admissions software which interfaced directly with PA schools. Completed applications were printed and mailed to programs via postal mail. In 2011, CASPA moved from the PA AdMIT admissions software to WebADMIT, a web-based admissions application which allows schools to receive and review applications online rather than receiving them by mail. Today, over 180 PA programs use CASPA, which accounts for 90% of ARC-PA <b>accredited</b> physician <b>assistant</b> programs in the United States. CASPA annually processes over 100,000 applications.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{compares the}} {{educational}} content of <b>accredited</b> physician <b>assistant</b> programs {{within the state}} of Texas. Programs (N = 8) were compared {{on the basis of}} prerequisite requirements, program characteristics and demographics, and core course content. Methods: A comparative study of all <b>accredited</b> physician <b>assistant</b> programs within the state of Texas was completed. Data was gathered via web sites, course catalogs, phone interviews, and site visits, and descriptive statistics were calculated utilizing Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. Results: 63 % (5) of the programs studied currently award masters degrees. 50 % (4) require a minimum GPA of 3. 0. Mean faculty to student ratio for all programs was 1 to 7. 38 % (3) of program directors hold a doctorate degree. 85 % (7) of schools include human cadaver study as part of the curriculum. 71 % (5, N = 7) of schools that offer cadaver study include both prosection and complete dissection. The mean total patient contact hours were 2318 and the mean total instructional hours were 1224. 85 % (7) had total educational hours greater than 3000. Coursework categories (N = 15) with the highest mean total number of instructional hours among the eight programs were Clinical Medicine (333), Patient Evaluation (169), and Human Anatomy and Physiology (165). A wide range of instructional hours was found in the majority (93 %, 14, N = 15) of categories of instruction with the narrowest range found in the category of Psychiatry/Behavioral Science, with a range of 48 - 30 hours. Conclusions: This study found general similarities, but significant, quantifiable differences with respect to instructional hours and patient contact hours. P A programs studied appear to have general consistency within pre-requisite requirements and some consistency with respect to program characteristics. However, with respect to core coursework, although there is consistency among the types of courses offered, there appears to be significant differences in the number of instructional hours within each category. In addition, significant differences exist in the number of total patient contact hours and total instructional hours...|$|R
50|$|In fall 2014, the University {{opened its}} newest building, the Integrated Professional Education Complex (IPEX) and {{demonstrates}} USciences’ commitment to preparing graduates for {{careers in the}} life sciences and health sciences professions. The 57,000-square-foot, three-story building showcases an integrated education model that permits students from several disciplines, including physician assistant studies, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise science, psychology, and healthcare business and policy, to obtain traditional and hands-on experience. This integrated education model gives students an opportunity to fully understand its value in their everyday practice. IPEX combines innovative learning spaces and student lounge space with simulation labs, a clinical lab, mock patient exam rooms, and conference rooms. It will {{also serve as a}} hub for students to study, interact, and learn with and from one another. IPEX houses the provisionally <b>accredited</b> physician <b>assistant</b> studies graduate professional program. A green-roof system that emphasizes the University’s commitment to the environment and sustainability, measures 20,000 square feet and will absorb nearly 15,000 gallons of water when fully saturated. IPEX earned three Green Globes from the Green Building Initiative.|$|R
