The Treasury description leaves many issues unanswered. Here we explain how an <b>aggregator</b> <b>bank</b> might operate in practice. We fill {{in some of the}} major details so as to enhance the effectiveness of the <b>aggregator</b> <b>bank.</b> In particular, the approach emphasizes transparency and value to the taxpayer, minimizing the need for bank-by-bank negotiations and thereby minimizing the opportunities for the government to play favorites.

50|$|National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) will {{function}} as the authorised Bharat Bill Payment Central Unit (BBPCU), which {{will be responsible for}} setting business standards, rules and procedures for technical and business requirements for all the participants. NPCI, as the BBPCU, will also undertake clearing and settlement activities related to transactions routed through BBPS. Existing bill <b>aggregators</b> and <b>banks</b> are envisaged to work as Operating Units to provide an interoperable bill payment system irrespective of which unit has on-boarded a particular biller. Payments may be made through the BBPS using cash, transfer cheques, and electronic modes.|$|R
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Science in Financial Economics at Strathmore UniversityOne of the key components of development funds for Kenya is Official Development Assistance (ODA). However, given ODA's general underwhelming nature and overall ineffectiveness in fostering economic development, {{it would be useful}} to consider absorption capacity as the best measure of how well aid to Kenya is working, and not just the gross amount of ODA flows to Kenya. That is the basis of this research. The research utilized time series data obtained from the World <b>Bank</b> <b>aggregator,</b> using a time period of 30 years i. e. 1981 to 2010. The dependent variable in this research is GDP growth rate, which indexes economic development. The absorptive capacity was found to display a mean reverting trend, with an average of 87 % over the past 30 years. Thereafter, an Auto regressive Distributed Lag model was used to determine the long run relationship between ODA absorption and economic development. The results of the model showed that the absorptive capacity of ODA negatively influences economic development in the current time period, but it has a positive and significant influence on economic development in the next time period. However, in the long run, the relationship between the two variables is statistically insignificant, meaning that the relationship between the two cannot be determined to be a result of anything but mere chance...|$|R
40|$|Set in December 2016, {{the case}} follows Sumeet Mehta, CEO of Cardpe Services Private Ltd, a fintech startup {{established}} {{to tap into}} the gap that existed in the payments acceptance infrastructure in India. Cardpe was all set to launch a mobile Point-of-Sale (mPOS) device – a wireless handheld integrated unit - that processed credit/debit card payments. Cash was a predominant medium of transaction in the country but the government was accelerating digitalisation and promoting measures to move towards a less-cash economy. Measures were underway to bring the largely unbanked public into banking network. Correspondingly, debit and credit card issuance was also growing. However, the availability of point-of-sale (POS) devices that could process credit/debit card payments was inadequate and remained concentrated among large merchants in cities. Due to this shortfall, the use of cards for payments remained low. Cardpe intended to target the merchants in the Tier II and Tier III cities, which were largely ignored by the acquiring <b>banks,</b> <b>aggregators</b> and the electronic wallet companies. Mehta had to assess the market potential for mPOS in the increasingly crowded market and to evaluate the odds stacked against Cardpe in the target market and as he re-examines Carpe’s go-to-market strategy. This case offers an opportunity to learn about the innovation adoption model and the challenges involved in altering market behaviour; and devising marketing strategy to overcome barriers involved in product adoption. The case would also help students to understand how to apply and integrate market data and information on evolving scenarios to estimate the market size for a product/service...|$|R
