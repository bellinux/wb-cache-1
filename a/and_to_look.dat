5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{inquiries}} into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47-year-old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after the licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green. Police believed at first that she had died of natural causes. An autopsy failed to establish a cause of death, and her body was returned to Ireland for burial.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E

5|$|Zubir said he {{was never}} driven by money. He {{believed}} that money was essential for his survival <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after the family, and that the money he earned from giving music lessons and his compositions for the film world sufficed. He valued honesty and sincerity in his work and placed importance on purity and originality, whether in his music, lyrics or style of singing. He stopped composing songs for the film company when he was upset about the management's decision to cut production costs by borrowing existing music {{to be used for}} dubbing on to the background music of some films.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E

The CBOs now have their own management committees staffed by volunteers from the community. UNRWA provides them with technical and small sums of targeted financial assistance, but many have formed links of their own with local and international NGOs.|$|E

It was going to be both a {{teaching}} experience, as several students went with him, and a chance for him to begin photographing again. He arrived in Mexico in early July, and, as a sign of White's reputation and influence, he was immediately visited by Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles.|$|E
25|$|The idents for the channel, {{designed}} by Lambie-Nairn, {{are the same}} as at launch and consist of yellow blobs, the opposite to the green blobs launched with the CBBC Channel with a much younger feel, as befits the target audience. The yellow blobs were also seen in BBC Kids' current idents. They directly oppose the CBBC blobs, as these blobs are gentle in their actions <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, whereas the green CBBC blobs looked more outgoing and violent—one of the CBBC idents at the time involved karate.|$|E
25|$|National {{and local}} {{government}} regulations require a minimum width for aisles in various building types. Regulatory agencies frequently inspect buildings, vehicles, etc., to enforce regulations requiring that aisles not be restricted. Inspectors have imposed fines for blocking or restricting passage when boxes or folding chairs are stored in aisles, for example. Insurance companies frequently have safety inspectors to examine the premises, both to determine whether insureds are complying with the insurer's requirements for coverage <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for any practices {{that could lead to}} injury or property damage, including restricting passage in aisles.|$|E

25|$|The immense {{industrial}} plantations {{of eucalyptus}} (originally intended to supply a hypothetical pulp mill) produce wood for export. This indigenous {{species of the}} Australian continent hinders the diversification of the undergrowth of the Kouilou region, whose soil is already sandy and poor. It follows a decrease in land reserved for agricultural activities. Active or disadvantaged local populations are forced to abandon artisanal activities <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for salaried jobs in mining companies. The production of charcoal for cooking, agriculture, hunting and gathering to feed these populations that are urbanizing and whose relationship with their original natural environment fades, are not made to reassure {{the future of the}} biodiversity of the region.|$|E
25|$|The EU Parliament's remit was to investigate, without prejudice, alleged {{breaches}} of Community law {{in relation}} to the collapse, to assess the UK regulatory regime in respect of Equitable Life <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the adequacy of remedies available to policyholders including the 15,000 non-UK members. The 22-member committee heard evidence from 38 witnesses and analysed 92 public documents, and its report is the only one completely independent of UK Government influence. Whilst a detailed summary of the full document is well outside the scope of this article, an examination of the effectiveness of the supervision of Equitable is given below and closely follows the wording.|$|E

25|$|Oxford and Cambridge {{have common}} {{approaches}} to undergraduate admissions. Until the mid-1980s, entry was typically by sitting special entrance exams. Applications {{must be made}} at least three months early, and, with only minor exceptions (e.g., organ scholars), are mutually exclusive for first undergraduate degrees so, in any one year, candidates may only apply to Oxford or Cambridge, not both. Because most candidates are predicted to achieve top grades at A level, interviews are usually used to check whether the course is well suited to the applicant's interests and aptitudes, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for evidence of self-motivation, independent thinking, academic potential and ability to learn through the tutorial system.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War (19141918), Morley {{gathered}} {{intelligence about}} and {{reported on the}} movements of German operatives in the region, information in which the U.S. Government had a keen interest. According to subsequent investigations, Morley {{was one of a}} number of ONI operatives working in the region under the guise of conducting scholarly research. Their mission was to seek out evidence of pro-German and anti-American agitation in the Mexico-Central America region <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for secret German submarine bases (which proved non-existent). Morley's archaeological work provided a ready excuse to travel the countryside armed with photographic equipment, and he himself traveled more than 2,000 miles (over 3,200km) along the coastlines of Central America in search of evidence for German bases.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first.

Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
