25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, {{the team}} took the train north for matches against {{two of the}} strongest county sides, Lancashire and Yorkshire. They played Lancashire at Old Trafford in Manchester 12 to 14 June and Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield 16 to 18 June. The Australians won both matches, {{comprehensively}} defeating Lancashire by an innings and 157 runs but only by one wicket against Yorkshire after a dramatic finale. At Old Trafford, Collins won the toss, decided to bat <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from the first ball with 103. Trenerry scored a career-highest 82 and the Australians batted into the second day to total a commanding 418. Lancashire collapsed twice with 125 and 136, the match ending same day. Stirling took five for 38 in the first innings and then Lampard produced the remarkable figures of nine for 42 in the second.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-17th {{century that}} another major {{contributor}} {{to the field of}} neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to use the words 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people who suffered from manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions of the brain.|$|E

500|$|Although France {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the heartland of medieval architecture", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12thcentury. French historian François Gebelin wrote: [...] "The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century fortified castles remaining to-day". Despite this, {{by the beginning of the}} 15thcentury, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went into decline. The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Europe– particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland– castles were built well into the 16thcentury.|$|E
500|$|In January 2002, S Club 7 {{embarked}} {{upon their}} second arena tour, S Club 7 Carnival 2002, which aimed to please fans by stylising their songs to fit with a carnival-like theme with music styles from different {{countries of the}} world. Speaking about the tour, McIntosh described it as [...] "older show", a change from S Club Party 2001, which was [...] "more like bubblegum", with Paul Cattermole comparing 2001's [...] "theatrical" [...] tour with the Carnival tour as a more [...] "glitzy, concert stage". The tour was generally well received by the children's media, describing the show as [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "dazzling", whereas the group was criticised by the broadsheets as being [...] "like a compilation of toddler-friendly Eurovision entries" [...] although conceding {{that it was a}} [...] "slick, decent-value show". Cattermole was also criticised when he was dubbed overweight and a [...] "heavy-footed dancer". After the success of their last three singles, all of which had made it to number-one, S Club 7 failed to top the charts when they released their ninth single, [...] "You"; it reached number-two in the UK. The single, which was described as a [...] "candyfloss-bright, tongue-in-cheek 50s pastiche", was to be Paul Cattermole's last single with the band <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for a series of events that was to unravel S Club 7's time {{at the top of the}} charts, which would ultimately cause the band to split.|$|E
500|$|Vikram did {{not sign}} up to a film for sixty {{five days after the}} release of Sethu, to ensure that he made the right career move. Vikram spent time {{completing}} projects he had agreed to feature in before the release of Sethu and hence made a couple of appearances in the Malayalam films, Red Indians and the horror film Indriyam. He also played a leading role in Siragugal, a rare Tamil telefilm produced and featuring Radhika Sarathkumar, which was shot entirely in the suburbs of London. Furthermore, he also completed two Telugu films during the period; 9 Nelalu and Youth. 9 Nelalu featured Vikram as the husband of the character played by Soundarya, who faces the challenges of being a surrogate mother. The film won positive reviews, with a critic mentioning that Vikram gave a [...] "controlled performance; while Vikram's newfound popularity in Tamil films saw the film dubbed into Tamil soon after as Kandane Seethayai, with an inserted comedy track by comedian Vivek. His next release was Rajakumaran's Vinnukum Mannukum, alongside Sarath Kumar, Kushboo and Devayani, which revolved around an ordinary boy falling in love with an actress. Vikram has since mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that [...] "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong"; the film became a failure commercially. His next film was Dhill where he played an aspiring police officer, Kanagavel, who tackles a corrupt policeman. To appear trim {{in the role of the}} aspiring police officer, Vikram went on a strict diet eating only fruits and drinking juice. The film opened to positive reviews with a critic from The Hindu claiming that [...] "Vikram has the ability and potential" [...] and that [...] "Vikram has once again proved that his success in Sethu was not a fluke". Dhill subsequently went on to become Vikram's first success in the masala film genre <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for more such films in the same genre for him. Vikram's portrayal of a blind folk singer in Vinayan's Kasi won him the Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award and the film also did well commercially. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind. Again, Vikram's performance won positive reviews from critics with a reviewer describing it as an [...] "extraordinarily detailed performance" [...] and that [...] "as the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one's throat".|$|E

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, she seemed comfortable being the pop megastar that she is." [...] Spin named Femme Fatale the 50th best album of 2011 and also placed it at number 3 in their [...] "20 Best Pop Albums of 2011" [...] list. Digital Spy ranked the album at number 11 at their year ends list. [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was named the third best song of 2011 by Rolling Stone and the third best single of 2011 by Billboard, who described it as [...] "Britney's most immediate single since 'Toxic'." [...] Sam Lansky of PopCrush considered [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] the best pop song of 2011. Digital Spy also considered the track as the best song of 2011, naming it [...] "Britney's best track since 'Toxic'" [...] and [...] "her most underrated hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a {{turnover}} in perspectives towards {{the causes of the}} Great famine {{in the mind of the}} Irish-American that can be traced: one that varies from a [...] "mourning religious view", seen in Archbishop Hughes' sermon, to a perspective that shifts the blame towards the British monarchy for its indifference and greed, seen in Cahill's speech in 1860. From that point on, all the following commemorative speeches on the Saint Patrick's Day invoked nationalist themes such as [...] "British hatred" [...] and [...] "heroic struggle" [...] <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for the creation of a [...] "new parade" [...] which gained in adherents and absorbed [...] "elements of American patriotism and full-fledged nationalism". The end result was such that the Irish-American community came to regard itself in the 1870s as a community that defined itself by dual loyalties on one hand, and in another as [...] "a unified common organism," [...] which gathered in strength on the basis that they had a common past, [...] "not a religious one but one that centered on the common Irish experience of British oppression and suffering". In other words, this goes to show that the shifting character of commemorative rituals experienced during the Saint Patrick's parade have influenced the development of American culture in a larger sense, since it contributed to enriching its heritage and making of its Irish-American Diaspora a prideful concept to be celebrated and admired.|$|E
