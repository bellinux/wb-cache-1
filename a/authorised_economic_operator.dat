40|$|Building {{collaborative}} {{relationships with}} trusted businesses {{is a long-term}} strategy for EU governments. Recently, the realisation of this goal has become more visible with the emerging concept of the <b>Authorised</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operator</b> (AEO). Businesses in the member states can apply for the AEO certificate from government. The aim for granting AEO is to create possible 'win-win' situation with increased trade efficiency and lowered administrative burden. However, without proper selection mechanism, this policy can be misunderstood/misused due to asymmetric information {{between the government and}} businesses. In this paper, we focus on modelling the cause and effect of the adverse selection in the Government-to-Business (G 2 B) relationship building. We argue that an IT-enabled risk assessment approach can effectively eliminate the G 2 B information asymmetry and solve the adverse selection problem. The business model of AEO assessment is built to give a real-life example on how IT-enabled risk management approach can help with collaborative G 2 B relationships building. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This paper mainly {{examines}} {{whether or}} not the celebrated Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) offers any ground-breaking provisions that are not in the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC). A comparative study of the two ‘laws ’ then reveals that the TFA is mainly a reflection of the RKC provisions. Besides, the very few aspects of the TFA which are not regulated by the RKC are, in fact, catered for by other instruments and tools of the World Customs Organization (WCO). From the above, and in light of the current impasse concerning the adoption of the Protocol of Amendment that would lead to incorporation of the TFA into the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) legal framework, it is opined that even if the TFA were to fail to come into force, a further developed RKC – incorporating, for instance, some aspects of the ‘SAFE Package ’ like the <b>Authorised</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operator</b> (AEO) – would make a perfect substitute. 1...|$|E

40|$|The September 11, 2001 {{attack on}} the World Trade Centre in New York brought a {{paradigm}} shift to the focus of Customs. Following that event and the global terrorist threat, a number of customs control initiatives and instruments were developed and implemented.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{revolves}} around the European Union's (EU's) <b>Authorised</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operator</b> (AEO) program, where operators are provided preferential treatment and simplified customs procedures with the real purpose creating a totally facilitated and secure international supply chain. The September 11 attacks uncovered how vulnerable supply chains actually were to unanticipated disruptions. Following the attacks, number of initiatives aimed at improving {{the security of the}} supply chain were introduced worldwide. While securing the supply chain, these programs can have the effect to hinder trade. In a world where customers are demanding their product to be delivered quicker and cheaper, the topic of trade facilitation has been increasingly discussed. The World Customs Organization (WCO) established the SAFE Framework guidelines in 2005, aiming to both facilitating trade and securing supply chains at the same time. The SAFE Framework provides the base for all regional AEO programs worldwide. This paper is based on a previous research from 2011, which focused on how the AEO program impacted supply chain security and customs procedures for Swedish companies. However, this paper {{revolves around}} how companies in Sweden perceive the AEO program in terms of its current and future impacts. Due to limited research available on the topic of AEO, an exploratory research was performed providing the reader with a conceptual framework of all related aspects of the AEO program. Interview results have revealed that the AEO certification raises security awareness within companies as well as slightly reducing the overall workload when it comes to customs procedures. Other than that, the program offers limited benefits but companies hope that being certified will aid them in the future. The paper concludes that it is essential that the AEO certification and its reputation are sufficiently valuable in order for companies to apply to become certified or even maintaining their current AEO status. Hence, governments and companies should strongly promote the AEO certification in order to exploit its suggested benefits to the fullest...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} {{research into the}} motives, the benefits and the impact the AEO certificate could have on noncertified organisations. By introducing the voluntary <b>Authorised</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operator</b> certificate on the market, the European government makes their intentions clear to distinguish trusted, law obliging organisations from dubious operating organisations. In theory, this system allows a lowering of the trade boundaries for the certified businesses while the local customs can control more effectively the noncertified organisations at the same time. Companies are enticed to obtain the AEO by certain benefits the certificate grants. The most notable advantage is the possibility to avoid customs controls. This in turn can improve the reliability and throughput time of a company’s supply chain. In order to establish if the AEO certificate can form a valuable addition to a company, three research objectives were founded; identify the level of awareness among noncertified organisations, evaluate the representativeness of the proclaimed benefits of the certificate and asses the possible motivations to acquire the AEO. A literature review has been executed {{in order to obtain}} information for the research objectives. In addition, a questionnaire has been distributed among the European sub companies of the Makhteshim Agan Industry (MAI) organisation. All the participants of this survey are entitled to obtain the certificate but have not done that until now. From the findings of the research it appeared that among the European countries a different level of support and certifying procedures are applied. This finding is further supported by the contrasting spread of the AEO holders throughout the European Community. This outcome can form one probable cause why there is a low level of in depth awareness and a significant large hesitation among organisations to obtain the certificate. Furthermore, the proclaimed benefits of the AEO certificate appears to be less relevant to organisations then the risk of losing earlier obtained benefits for faster customs procedures. This risk formed in addition the main motivation for organisations to obtain the certificate. From the findings it became clear the AEO certificate is not yet in its projected state. However the benefits it provides for the government are so large {{that it will be a}} matter of time before the voluntary certificate turns into an unavoidable asset. Business Schoo...|$|E
