500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, {{as a main}} cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in [...] "Ji Yeon." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was {{brought back to the}} show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Kelley's character, Walt, was [...] "benched" [...] {{for the majority of the}} second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing [...] "Through the Looking Glass".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E

In it, they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, and artists have been fighting against it.

2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists <b>are,</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs.
