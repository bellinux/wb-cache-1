40|$|Abstract Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to present an analyze of case studies about {{entrepreneurship}} and strategy in Sweden. The overall purpose is to find out how many case studies there are, when they were written, and what type of cases studies there are <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subjects</b> in Sweden, an inventory. Design/methodology/approach - The method used in this paper is qualitative secondary research from databases. The databases consist of Web of Science, Scopus, Diva, Google scholar and Emerald insight. Other secondary data are from research books and popular science sources. Implications/Findings - According to this study there is a lack of case studies about entrepreneurship and strategy in Sweden. This should implicate for more further studies within case studies and the creation of case studies should increase. Most of the case studies are written in the 2000 s and most of the cases are exploratory or descriptive. Originality/value - This paper is supposed to give accurate information about case studies in the determined area of research and give knowledge to companies and be helpful for further researches. Keywords - Sweden, case studies, entrepreneurship, strategy. Paper type - Research paper. ...|$|R
6000|$|If such an {{extraordinary}} adaptation as this stood alone, {{it would be}} very difficult to offer any explanation of it; but although it is perhaps the most perfect case of protective imitation known, there are hundreds of similar resemblances in nature, and from these it is possible to deduce a general theory of the manner in which they have been slowly brought about. The principle of variation and that of [...] "natural selection," [...] or survival of the fittest, as elaborated by Mr. Darwin in his celebrated [...] "Origin of Species," [...] offers the foundation for such a theory; and I have myself endeavoured to apply it to all the chief cases of imitation in an article published in the [...] "Westminster Review" [...] for 1867, entitled, [...] "Mimicry, and other Protective Resemblances Among Animals," [...] to which any reader is referred who wishes to know more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
60|$|No lawyer {{could have}} argued his case better than Mr. Macshane so far; and he {{completely}} succeeded in convincing Mr. and Mrs. Hayes {{of the necessity}} of ransoming their son. Promising that the young man should be restored to them next morning, along with his beautiful lady, he courteously took leave of the old couple, and made the best of his way back to Worcester again. The elder Hayes wondered who the lady could be of whom the ambassador had spoken, for their son's elopement was altogether unknown to them; but anger or doubt <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> was overwhelmed by their fears for their darling John's safety. Away rode the gallant Macshane with the money necessary to effect this; and it must be mentioned, as highly to his credit, that he never once thought of appropriating the sum to himself, or of deserting his comrades in any way.|$|E
60|$|He had {{certainly}} {{been successful in}} changing the old man's opinion. Mr. Bolton did not say as much, nor was he a man likely to make such acknowledgment; but when he led John Caldigate away to be introduced to {{his wife in the}} drawing-room, he felt less of disdain for his guest than he had done half an hour before. Mr. Bolton was a silent, cautious man, even in his own family, and had said nothing of this business to his wife, and nothing, of course, to his daughter. Mrs. Bolton asked after the Squire, and expressed a hope that her guest would not find the house very dull for one night. She had heard that John Caldigate was a fast young man, and of course regarded him as a lost sinner. Hester, who was with her mother, looked at him with all her young big eyes, but did not speak a word. It was very seldom that she saw any young man, or indeed young people of either sex. But when this stranger spoke freely to her mother <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> and the other, she listened to him and was interested.|$|E

6000|$|Why should I go on quoting texts? Look for yourselves, you who fancy {{that it is}} only on {{the other}} side of the grave that God will trouble Himself about you and your meanness, your profligacy, your falsehood. Look for yourselves in the book of God, and see if there be any writer there,--lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, apostle, up to Christ the Lord Himself,--who does not warn men again and again, that here, on earth, their sins will find them out. Our Saviour, indeed, when on earth, said less <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> than any of the prophets before Him, or the apostles after Him, and for the best of reasons. The Jews had got rooted in their minds a superstitious notion, that all disease, all sorrow, was the {{punishment}} in each case of some particular sin; and thus, instead of looking with pity and loving awe upon the sick and the afflicted, they were accustomed, too often, to turn from them as sinners, smitten of God, bearing in their distress the token of His anger. The blessed One,-- He who came to heal the sick and save the lost,--reproved that error more than once. When the disciples fancied a certain poor man's blindness to be a judgment from God, [...] "Neither did he sin," [...] said the Lord, [...] "nor his parents, but that the glory of God might be made manifest in him." [...] And yet, on the other hand, when He healed a certain man of an old infirmity at the pool of Bethesda, what were His words to him? [...] "Go thy way, sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee;"--a clear and weighty warning that all his long misery of eight-and-thirty years had been the punishment of some sin of his, and that the sin repeated would bring on him a still severer judgment.|$|E
6000|$|As the Colonel {{had opened}} the question, I ventured to make a respectful remonstrance against the scheme. Vindictiveness {{on the part of}} a man so simple and generous, so fair and noble in all his {{dealings}} as Thomas Newcome, appeared in my mind unworthy of him. Surely his kinsman had sorrow and humiliation enough already at home. Barnes's further punishment, we thought, might be left to time, to remorse, to the Judge of right and wrong; Who better understands than we can do, our causes and temptations towards evil actions, Who reserves the sentence for His own tribunal. But when angered, the best of us mistake our own motives, as we do those of the enemy who inflames us. What may be private revenge, we take to be indignant virtue and just revolt against wrong. The Colonel would not hear of counsels of moderation, such as I bore him from a sweet Christian pleader. [...] "Remorse!" [...] he cried out with a laugh, [...] "that villain will never feel it until he is tied up and whipped at the cart's tail! Time change that rogue! Unless he is wholesomely punished, he will grow a greater scoundrel every year. I am inclined to think, sir," [...] says he, his honest brows darkling as he looked towards me, [...] "that you too are spoiled by this wicked world, and these heartless, fashionable, fine people. You wish to live well with the enemy, and with us too, Pendennis. It can't be. He who is not with us is against us. I very much fear, sir, that the women, the women, you understand, have been talking you over. Do not let us speak any more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>subject,</b> for I don't wish that my son, and my son's old friend, should have a quarrel." [...] His face became red, his voice quivered with agitation, and he looked with glances which I was pained to behold in those kind old eyes: not because his wrath and suspicion visited myself, but because an impartial witness, nay, a friend to Thomas Newcome in that family quarrel, I grieved to think that a generous heart was led astray, and to see a good man do wrong. So with no more thanks for his interference than a man usually gets who meddles in domestic strifes, the present luckless advocate ceased pleading.|$|E
