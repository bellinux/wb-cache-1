5|$|Istanbul {{is famous}} for its nightlife, as well as its {{historic}} taverns, <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia.

İstiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has shifted toward shopping, but the nearby Nevizade Street is still lined with winehouses and pubs. Some other neighborhoods around İstiklal Avenue have recently been revamped to cater to Beyoğlu's nightlife, with formerly commercial streets now lined with pubs, cafes, and restaurants playing live music. Other focal points for Istanbul's nightlife include Nişantaşı, Ortaköy, Bebek, and Kadıköy.|$|E

5|$|The {{clarinet}} {{was originally}} a central instrument in jazz, {{beginning with the}} New Orleans players in the 1910s.

American players Alphonse Picou, Larry Shields, Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Sidney Bechet were all pioneers of the instrument in jazz. The B soprano was the most common instrument, but a few early jazz musicians such as Louis Nelson Delisle and Alcide Nunez preferred the C soprano, and many New Orleans jazz brass bands have used E soprano.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>signature</b> {{feature of}} Parthian {{architecture}} was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use {{of the barrel}} vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E

5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} called controllable ring signature which is ring signature with additional properties as follow. (1) Anonymous identification: by an anonymous identification protocol, the real signer can anonymously prove his authorship of the ring signature to the verifier. And this proof is non-transferable. (2) Linkable signature: the real signer can generate <b>an</b> anonymous <b>signature</b> such that every one can verify whether both this anonymous signature and the ring signature are generated by the same anonymous signer. (3) Convertibility: the real signer can convert <b>a</b> ring <b>signature</b> into <b>an</b> ordinary <b>signature</b> by revealing the secret information about the ring signature. These additional properties can fully ensure {{the interests of the}} real signer. Especially, compared with <b>a</b> standard ring <b>signature,</b> <b>a</b> controllable ring <b>signature</b> is more suitable for the classic application of leaking secrets. We construct <b>a</b> controllable ring <b>signature</b> scheme which is provably secure according to the formal definition. ...|$|R
40|$|Group {{signature}} {{and blind}} signature {{are very important}} primitives in cryptography. <b>A</b> group <b>signature</b> scheme allows <b>a</b> group member to sign messages anonymously {{on behalf of the}} group and <b>a</b> blind <b>signature</b> scheme can ensure anonymity of the sender of a message. Recently, S. Xia and J.

Chen [5] proposed <b>a</b> blind <b>signature</b> scheme based on dual complexities (which combines factorization and discrete logarithm problem). In this paper, we give a universal forgery attack on Xia-You's group signature scheme which any one (not necessarily a group member) can produce <b>a</b> valid group <b>signature</b> on <b>an</b> arbitrary message, and it is untraceable by the group revocation manager. For Chen-Chen's blind signature scheme, we show that it could not meet the untraceability property of <b>a</b> blind <b>signature,</b> i. e., it could not ensure anonymity of the user...|$|R
