5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E
5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E
5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out of medical school, was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man she was seeing. Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> is also responsible for a handful of murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that she did not see him as a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} the present study was to extend {{previous}} research by analyzing the ability of <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter to use phonological working memory in conjunction with lexical access to perform a word jumble task. Method Forty English words consisting of 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -letters (n = 10 per letter length category) were randomly jumbled using a web-based application. During the experimental task, 26 participants were asked to silently manipulate the scrambled letters to form a real word. Each vocal response was coded for accuracy and speech reaction time (SRT). Results <b>Adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter attempted to solve fewer word jumble stimuli than <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter at the 4 -letter, 5 -letter, and 6 -letter lengths. Additionally, <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter were significantly less accurate solving word jumble tasks at the 4 -letter, 5 -letter, and 6 -letter lengths compared to <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter. At the longest word length (6 -letter), SRT was significantly slower for the <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter than the fluent controls. Conclusion Results of the current study lend further support to the notion that differences in various aspects of phonological processing, including vision-to-sound conversions, sub-vocal stimulus manipulation, and/or lexical access are compromised in <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter...|$|R
40|$|Does math {{education}} {{contribute to}} refine the phylogenetically inherited capacity to approximately process large numbers? The question was examined in Western adults with different levels of math education. Unschooled <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> never received math education were compared to unschooled-instructed <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> did not attend regular school but received math education in adulthood, and to schooled <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> attended regular school in childhood. In the number-comparison task (Exp. 1), the unschooled group was slower and made more errors than the other groups both when numerical symbols and nonsymbolic dot collections were presented. In the forced-choice mapping task (Exp. 2), the unschooled group experienced more difficulty than the others in linking large nonsymbolic and symbolic quantities, {{as well as in}} matching purely nonsymbolic quantities. These results suggest that Western <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> did not receive math education have less precise approximate number skills than <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> acquired exact number competences through math education. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of learning disabilities {{are not always}} confined to childhood.

When we view the complex-ities of adult education when no learning problem exists—which is primarily the case presented in this paper—we cannot help but take the next step and become con-cerned with those <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> still require education and must be taught "through " or around a learning disability.

What are the major trends in the interests of American adults? How do interests influence participation in adult education? In fact, what is an interest...|$|R
5|$|The Order of the Arrow is {{organized}} into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; {{the boundaries of}} each OA region correspond with {{the boundaries of the}} BSA's regions. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chairman, all national committeemen from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{research}} the attitude of <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter on speech communication and to compare them to the attitude of those <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> don’t. In order to achieve it, BigCAT-SLO, a 35 -item self-report test was translated, the original aim of which was to measure the speech-associated attitude of <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter. BigCAT-SLO was verified by 27 <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> stutter who were, {{during the time of}} the research, in the diagnostic phase of the logopedic treatment. They represented a test group. 81 fluent <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> don’t stutter belonged in a control group. The difference in the attitude of both groups turned out to be statistically important. Furthermore, a statistically important connection between attitude on speech communication and the intensity of stuttering was determined. However, the sex and age of persons didn’t correlate significantly with the attitude. Considering the fact that most of the items of the BigCAT-SLO test turned out to be significantly discriminative and that the test was estimated at a high reliability coefficient, the BigCAT-SLO can be considered as a useful instrument for reaching decisions in the process of diagnosing as the therapy of those who stutter. ...|$|R

25|$|The term MODY {{dates back}} to 1964, when {{diabetes}} mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to {{what we now call}} type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.|$|E
25|$|Members who do {{not conform}} to these {{community}} expectations and who cannot be convinced to repent are excommunicated. In addition to excommunication, members may be shunned, a practice that limits social contacts to shame the wayward member into returning to the church. Almost 90 percent of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the church. During an adolescent period of rumspringa ("running around") in some communities, nonconforming behavior that would result in the shunning of an <b>adult</b> <b>who</b> had made the permanent commitment of baptism, may meet with a degree of forbearance. Amish church groups seek to maintain a degree of separation from the non-Amish world, i.e. American and Canadian society. There is generally a heavy emphasis on church and family relationships. They typically operate their own one-room schools and discontinue formal education after grade eight, at age 13/14. Until the children turn 16, they have vocational training under the tutelage of their parents, community, and the school teacher.|$|E
