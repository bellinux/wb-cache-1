50|$|A {{traditional}} PAR <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> {{procedure is}} performed without a navigation signal available to compare {{directly to a}} truth reference. A traditional PAR is flight inspected by comparing written notes between two observers, one taking notes at a truth reference system such as a theodolite and the other observer taking notes while observing the radar console, see ICAO Document 8071. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach. Therefore, the graphical depiction can be directly verified using Instrument Landing System (ILS) <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> techniques.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> system is to {{calibrate}} and evaluate the performance of aircraft navigation and landing aids to ensure conformance to specifications. This mission requires that the <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> platform have a reference position estimate significantly more accurate {{than that of the}} facility under inspection, i. e., tenths of meter accuracy over a region of many kilometers, in a dynamic environment. Differential Global Navigation Satellite Systems (DGNSS) have the accuracy potential to be used in real time for ICAO Category III final approach <b>flight</b> <b>inspection.</b> However, this requires that the residual pseudorange errors be very small, and that the values of HDOP and VDOP be appropriately constrained. This paper presents the results achieved by employing several different position estimation techniques for estimating aircraft position during flight tests of an airborne <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> system in the final approach mode. These techniques use DGNSS measurements integrated with an Inertial Navigation System (INS), and alone. Measurements from GPS receivers which employ narrow correlator spacing and carrier-phase tracking techniques are used as an update ource to Kalman filters with and without INS states, and as measurements for a nonlinear least squares estimation of aircraft position. The accuracy results show that DGNSS-based position estimate techniques are capable of meeting ICAO requirements for <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> of the most stringent category of precise landing aids...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} DSP techniques in a portable <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> system for the airborne evaluation of ground-based radio navigational aids.

Two specific applications are presented here: 1) course displacement determination for the instrument landing system (ILS), and 2) azimuth angle determination for the VHF omni-range (VOR). The DSP techniques presented here were implemented in a <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> system which is in commercial use. The Requirement for Periodic Flight Inspectio...|$|R
