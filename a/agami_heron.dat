25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, <b>agami</b> <b>heron,</b> russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The <b>agami</b> <b>heron</b> {{is listed}} as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN, due to predictions of future habitat destruction within its range.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found in}} the area include: the golden-green woodpecker, the sunbittern, the king vulture, the {{undulated}} tinamou, the green ibis, the harpy eagle, the white-necked jacobin, the white-throated toucan, the red-and-green macaw, the red-throated caracara, the muscovy duck, the <b>agami</b> <b>heron,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agami</b> <b>herons</b> stalk {{their prey}} (fish, frogs, small reptiles, and snails) in shallow shaded water in forested areas. They often standi still on perches or {{directly}} in the water, or moving very slowly. They rarely wade in open water.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{birds of}} Victoria Peak and the Cockscomb Basin include: great curassow, crested guan, clay-coloured robins, social flycatchers, collared-seed eaters, crimson-collared tanagers and masked tanagers, bat falcons, Montezuma’s oropendola, {{as well as}} white-collared manakins, paraque, the slaty-breasted tinamou, {{chestnut}} headed oropendolas, parrots, toucans, and <b>Agami</b> <b>heron</b> to name a few.|$|E
50|$|The <b>agami</b> <b>heron</b> (Agamia agami) is a {{medium-sized}} heron. It is a resident breeding bird from Central America south to Peru and Brazil. It is sometimes {{known as the}} chestnut-bellied heron, {{and is the only}} member of the genus Agamia (Reichenbach, 1853). In Brazil it is sometimes called Soco beija-flor the « hummingbird heron » thanks to its unique coloration pattern.|$|E
50|$|The <b>agami</b> <b>heron</b> is a Neotropical species {{occurring}} in Central and South America.The distribution {{area of the}} species extends from south-east Mexico through central and Caribbean Central America through the Amazon basin in South America, covering the following countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Bladen Nature Reserve {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of ecosystems, ranging from the fertile floodplain vegetation to the higher elevations of the Maya Mountains. This has resulted in the high species richness observed within the area. The majority of the species are lowland broadleaf forest generalists, found throughout much of Belize. The floodplain of Bladen Branch also attracts many of the riverine, forest edge and gallery forest species, such as the bare-throated tiger heron (Tigrisoma mexicanum), the shy <b>agami</b> <b>heron</b> (Agamia agami) and Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), the white-necked jacobin (Florisuga mellivora) and yellow-tailed oriole (Icterus mesomelas). Other species closely associated with water have also been recorded - the various kingfishers, spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularia) and the two species of waterthrush.|$|E

50|$|The Tapiche Reserve is {{a private}} {{conservation}} property that employs a strict no catching/no caging policy. The abundance of wildlife on this property is a glimpse into how the entire region would have been prior to present-day logging and hunting activities. The reserve strives to educate visitors and locals alike on the most eco-friendly ways to enjoy the rainforest. Due to diligent patrolling and maintenance of the property against hunters and loggers, visitors {{have the opportunity to}} view rare and endangered animals in the wild. Species include the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the red uakari monkey, the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), the <b>agami</b> <b>heron</b> (Agamia agami) and several species of large raptors including the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), the crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and the ornate hawk eagle (Spizaetus ornatus).|$|E
50|$|The bill is {{generally}} long and harpoon-like. It {{can vary from}} extremely fine, as in the <b>agami</b> <b>heron,</b> to thick as in the grey heron. The most atypical bill {{is owned by the}} boat-billed heron, which has a broad, thick bill. The bill, as well as other bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black, or brown in colour, although this can vary during the breeding season. The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10 or 11 primary feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries. and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown, grey, or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons, little sexual dimorphism in plumage is seen (except in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron, both dark and light colour morphs exist, and the percentage of each morph varies geographically. White morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches.|$|E
