5|$|Highway127 was {{designated}} in late 1955, generally {{following the same}} route <b>as</b> <b>today,</b> {{with the exception of}} the northern terminus. During the early 1960s, a new road was constructed east of Whitney, bypassing the old highway for several kilometres. By 1963, the bypass was complete and Highway127 was rerouted onto it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. <b>As</b> <b>today,</b> {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate {{there were a number of}} Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E

5|$|Tofu: Although both popular {{tradition}} and Song Dynasty philosophers like Zhu Xi (1130–1200 AD) credit {{the invention of}} tofu—along with soymilk— to Liu An (179–122 BC), a Han-Dynasty King of Huainan, no mention of tofu {{is found in the}} extant Huainanzi (compiled under Liu An). The earliest known mention of tofu was made in Records of the Extraordinary (Qingyi lu 清異錄), which reported that tofu was sold at Qingyang (Anhui). The earliest explanation of how to make tofu is found in the Bencao Gangmu, written by the Ming dynasty polymath Li Shizhen (1518–1593). According to Liu Keshun (1999), Liu An's process for making tofu was essentially the same <b>as</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. <b>As</b> <b>today,</b> geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

50|$|The {{numbering}} of Bundesstraße 5 {{follows the}} numbering of highways, then called in Fernverkehrsstraßen (literally in far traffic streets), in the Weimar Republic, issued on 17 January 1932.

25|$|The {{route that}} SR108 takes today {{was signed in}} 1923 as SR188 south of Holgate and SR33 north of Holgate. The route north of Holgate as paved in this year. By 1929, SR188 was paved. SR108 was signed in 1938 on the same route <b>as</b> <b>today.</b> No {{significant}} changes have taken place to this state route since 1938.|$|E
25|$|Before 1987, most {{road signs}} had black {{backgrounds}} – diamonds indicated warnings, and rectangles indicated regulatory actions (with {{the exception of}} the Give Way sign (an inverted trapezium), and Stop sign and speed limit signs (which were the same <b>as</b> <b>today)).</b> Information signs were yellow, and direction signage was green on motorways and black everywhere else.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{was first}} signed in 1938 on {{much the same}} {{alignment}} <b>as</b> <b>today.</b> SR108 replaced the SR33 and SR188 designation of the highway which dated back to 1923. SR188 ran between Ottawa and Holgate and SR33 ran between Holgate and the Michigan state line. Some of the highway was paved in 1923, {{with the rest of}} the route being paved in 1929.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{adoption}} of color-coded names, the Blue Line {{was referred to as}} the West-Northwest Route (which it is still sometimes referred to <b>as</b> <b>today)</b> or more commonly, the O'Hare-Congress-Douglas route for its three branches. The Congress and Douglas branches were renamed for their terminals, Forest Park and 54th/Cermak, when the current color naming system was adopted in 1993. Blue Line service on the Douglas Branch was discontinued in April 2008 and replaced by the Pink Line.|$|E
25|$|Long ago, just <b>as</b> <b>today,</b> woodworkers {{required}} a more helpful {{way to keep}} the wood in place while it was being worked.

This is still a cheap and effective method for holding the work.|$|E
