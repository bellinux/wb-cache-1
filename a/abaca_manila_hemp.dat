50|$|The RFC {{established}} eight new {{corporations and}} purchased an existing corporation. Its eight wartime subsidiaries were the Metals Reserve Company, Rubber Reserve Company, Defense Plant Corporation, Defense Supplies Corporation, War Damage Corporation, U.S. Commercial Company, Rubber Development Corporation, and Petroleum Reserve Corporation. These corporations helped fund {{the development of}} synthetic rubber, the construction and operation of a tin smelter, {{and the establishment of}} <b>abaca</b> (<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp)</b> plantations in Central America. Both natural rubber and abaca (used to produce rope products) had been produced primarily in South Asia, which came under Japanese control during the war. The RFC's programs encouraged the development of alternative sources of these materials. Synthetic rubber, which was not produced in the United States prior to the war, quickly became the primary source of rubber in the postwar years.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of natural}} fibers in {{reinforced}} composites to produce eco-friendly materials is gaining more attention due to their attractive features such as low cost, low density and good mechanical properties, among others. This work thus investigates the potential of waste <b>abaca</b> (<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp)</b> fiber as reinforcing agent in an inorganic aluminosilicate material known as geopolymer. In this study, the waste fibers were subjected to different chemical treatments to modify the surface characteristics and to improve the adhesion with the fly ash-based geopolymer matrix. Definitive screening design of experiment was used to investigate the effect of successive chemical treatment of the fiber on its tensile strength considering the following factors: (1) NaOH pretreatment; (2) soaking time in aluminum salt solution; and (3) final pH of the slurry. The {{results show that the}} abaca fiber without alkali pretreatment, soaked for 12 h in Al 2 (SO 4) 3 solution and adjusted to pH 6 exhibited the highest tensile strength among the treated fibers. Test results confirmed that the chemical treatment removes the lignin, pectin and hemicellulose, as well as makes the surface rougher with the deposition of aluminum compounds. This improves the interfacial bonding between geopolymer matrix and the abaca fiber, while the geopolymer protects the treated fiber from thermal degradation...|$|E

40|$|In {{the city}} center of Tawau in Sabah, Eastern Malaysia, stands a little belfry. It was built in 1921 by the local Japanese {{community}} to commemorate the restoration of peace after World War I. Sabah was then called British North Borneo and had been administered from 1882 by the British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBCC). Britain and Japan entered into an alliance in January 1902 and fought World War I together against Germany. This alliance, however, became defunct in December 1921, and {{relations between the two}} were at their worst during the Asia-Pacific War when Japan attacked and occupied Borneo. The Allied forces fought back and, through intensive bombing, turned British Borneo into 'a state of devastation unequaled throughout the British Empire'. Ninety-nine per cent of the public buildings in British North Borneo were destroyed, and in Tawau the belfry was the only public building that remained unscathed; it still stands, without a bell, symbolizing war, peace, and emptiness. However, {{there is no longer a}} Japanese immigrant community in Borneo; all the immigrants were forced to repatriate after Japan surrendered in 1945. The Japanese people who were in British Borneo at the time of the outbreak of the Asia-Pacific War were mostly agricultural immigrants who had been tenant farmers in Japan with no land to inherit. They immigrated to Borneo to become owners of small <b>abaca</b> (<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp)</b> estates, but most males enlisted in 1944 and became part of the occupation army in Borneo. Half of them died in 1945; all the survivors were shipped back to Japan in 1946. Their social position changed as the wheel of fortune turned, from being landless farmers in Japan to estate owners in the tropics, then occupier, occupied, and finally repatriates. This chapter examines what made the wheel turn and how this turning affected them...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of Okinawans emigrated abroad in order to escape from poverty before World War II. One of their {{favorite}} destinations was Davao {{on the island of}} Mindanao, the Philippines. Davao was a center of global <b>abaca</b> (<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp)</b> industry, and attracted many Okinawans since Kozo Ohshiro, an influential Okinawan pioneer, actively invited workers from his prefecture to Davao. Generally Okinawan migrants had less capital but stronger transnational human network based on blood relations such as Manchu (Okinawan patrilineal kin group), common ties to the same village and shared identity as Uchinanchu. Most of them worked as laborers in the abaca plantation managed by their Okinawan relatives or fellows, and belonged to 'the middle classes' positioned between plantation owners and Filipino laborers. Okinawan migrants, who constituted half of the 20, ODD-strong Japanese populace in prewar Davao, can be described as "labour diasporas" in Robin Cohen's classification of global diasporas. The Okinawans were distinguishable from mainland Japanese due to somewhat different appearance and culture. Thus, they were called "Otra Hapan" (the other Japanese) by Davao's natives. The Okinawans were more in-marriage oriented than the mainland Japanese, and thus had a tendency to avoid intermarriage with Filipinos. The latter also tended to have a biased view of the Okinawans. Unlike Okinawan migrants in Brazil, the South Sea Island and other settlements, Okinawan settlers of Davao were not so discriminated by mainland Japanese {{because of the presence of}} a substantial number of successful and influential Okinawans. Nevertheless, mainland Japanese settlers tended to regard Okinawan settlers as 'second-class Japanese' primarily for the reason of the latter's economic status that was presumed to be lower than the former. These two kinds of Japanese avoided inter-subethnic marriage because of their ethnic division and mutual prejudice although they struggled together against the Philippine government's attempt to reduce the scale of "Davaokuo", a term coined to resemble Manchukuo. The Japanese military occupation of the Philippines brought a series of misfortunes to Okinawans, especially abaca cultivators. They were ordered to change their farm products from abaca to rice and vegetables supplied for their forces. Most men were conscripted as Imperial Japan's soldiers or paramilitary personnel although no small number of them had emigrated from Okinawa to Davao in order to evade military service. As a consequence, they became enemies for the majority of the Filipinos whose lives were badly deteriorated under the Japanese military rule. Okinawan migrants had to undo many years of their hard work in the settlement of Davao that was once their 'paradise'. At the final stage of "Davaokuo", numerous Okinawan and mainland Japanese evacuees died of hunger, disease, and other reasons such as their 'fellow' soldiers' killings for their own survival. After the end of the war, all Japanese migrants were ordered to repatriate to Japan by the Allied Powers. Okinawan repatriates were classified as non-Japanese "Ryukyuan refugees". Their ethnic label was suddenly changed probably for the benefit of the US postwar military strategy. Davao's Okinawan diasporas were at the mercy of their fate between Japan and the US, and between 'Japanese' and 'non-Japanese'...|$|E

5000|$|From 2001 through 2010, the Philippines {{production}} of <b>abaca</b> fiber (<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp)</b> averaged 65,701 mt {{per year and}} was decreasing {{at a rate of}} at least 0.8% per annum. The decrease was caused by the devastating typhoons in 2006, abaca viral diseases that continued to affect the plantations, and the dampened foreign demand brought about by the global economic recession beginning {{in the latter part of}} 2008, the most severe downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Production reached its peak in 2008 at 77,387 mt as outputs of all producing regions, particularly Bicol, Davao Region and Caraga, substantially increased during the period. This was primarily the effect of the incremental production from the abaca plantations established in 2005 and 2006 under FIDA's program Goal I [...] "Development of New Agri-Business Lands" [...] and the continued strong demand and attractive prices offered for the fiber by local traders, processors/manufacturers, and exporters. The abaca industry, however, suffered a setback in 2009 when fiber yield slumped to its lowest level of 54,584 mt due to the weakened market demand and falling prices as a consequence of the worldwide financial crisis. Catanduanes Island is the native habitat of the endemic abaca plant (a banana relative) which is globally renowned for its strong fiber. In fact, the Philippines FIDA (Fiber Industry Development Authority) declared the island as the highest abaca-producing province in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Hemp is {{an annual}} crop grown for the {{production}} of fiber. It is sown in the spring like small grain and produces a thick stand of slender unbranched stalks, growing usually to a height of 6 to 10 feet. The fiber is found extending the length of the stalk, between the thin bark on the outside and the woody central pith on the inside. To obtain, the fiber the stalks are retted (partially decomposed) and then put through machines that separate the fiber {{from the rest of the}} stalk. Although hemp has been grown in the United States since early colonial days the acreage of this crop has not been very extensive. Due primarily to competition from cotton, jute, sisal and <b>abaca</b> (<b>Manila</b> fiber) domestic <b>hemp</b> production declined until a low of 1, 200 acres was reached in 1933. Since 1939, because of the stimulation of an increased demand due to war conditions, production has again increased.

In the 1800s, the Philippines made use of the services of Nicolas Loney, Great Britain's Vice Consul to Iloilo, to improve the sugarcane industry. Loney utilized two British Brigs, the SS Pet and the SS Camilla to dock at the Port of Iloilo to load sugar going to Melbourne, Australia where the Victoria Sugar Company was waiting. The Negros Islands also exported sugar to Australia. Perdon (2014) also cites that Australians utilize the purchased sugar from the Philippines for the distillation of rum. On the other hand, Australia returned the favor by marketing its fresh bottled milks in Manila. Another commodity that Australia values from the Philippines is the <b>manila</b> <b>hemp.</b> Perdon (2014) explains the <b>manila</b> <b>hemp's</b> [...] "fibre length, lightness and whiteness of colour" [...] are the reasons why it is an in-demand product in Australia.
