5|$|<b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and}} more alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

The following year, she settled {{in the city of}} Lebanon in Oregon's Willamette Valley with her son Jamie and boyfriend Ron Duncan, a local meat cutter and bookkeeper. While living in Oregon, Power taught cooking classes at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany and worked at restaurants in Corvallis and Eugene. She reached the shortlist for the post of food writer for the Corvallis Gazette-Times and became part-owner of Napoli Restaurant and Bakery in Eugene.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France {{would never}} accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich {{remained}} the favourite home of Richard Talbot's descendants for many years. During the early years, {{the security situation}} in Wales remained of concern. Owain Glyndŵr rebelled against English rule in 1402 and Welsh forces invaded the Goodrich area in 1404 and 1405. Gilbert Talbot was responsible for fighting back the Welsh advance and securing the castle. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, however, the threat began to diminish. During the 15th century the Talbots considerably expanded {{the size of the}} lord's quarters in the castle and provided additional accommodation for servants and retainers.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E

Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933. Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, Matilda {{directed}} more of {{her attention}} to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E

Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated {{to end in}} Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E

Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid.
