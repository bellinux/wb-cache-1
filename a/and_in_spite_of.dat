5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} Football League Cup {{in the third}} round, where they were drawn away to Sunderland. A 3–0 victory meant they progressed to the fourth round, where they beat First Division club Reading by an {{identical}} scoreline. Extra time and penalties was required in Arsenal's fifth round tie against Doncaster Rovers, after a 2–2 draw in 90 minutes. Two saves by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia helped Arsenal win 3–1 on penalties and reach the semi-finals of the competition {{for the first time}} since 1998. They faced Wigan Athletic, losing 1–0 in the first leg <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> winning the second leg 2–1 with a full strength team, Arsenal was eliminated on aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal played Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round on 9 March 2002. It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle held them to a 1–1 draw. A replay was {{scheduled}} two weeks later at noon. Arsenal won by three goals to nil, but during the match lost Robert Pirès to injury; he was ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick, was enough for Arsenal to win the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{succumbed to}} a 4–1 defeat in their opening match against Spartak Moscow, {{which was the}} biggest loss inflicted on the club in 18 years. The team let slip a two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals attainable. In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue fatigue {{and the absence of}} captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E

5|$|Nazi {{society had}} {{elements}} supportive of animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E
5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the Rite of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry. Banned in 1817, it was reformulated as the Rite of Memphis in 1838, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> fluctuating fortunes in its French home, began to spread internationally {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which actually worked.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{started his}} career as a sailor and officer on the slave ships Aurore, Courrier d'Afrique and Navigateur. Having risen to captain, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the {{prohibition}} of slave trading by the National Convention in 1793, he engaged in the business himself as a captain on Créole. He then captained the merchantman Émilie, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a letter of marque. He preyed on British shipping, capturing the East Indiaman Triton, before returning to Île de France in the Indian Ocean, where his prizes were confiscated. He then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government.|$|E

He beat Smith's time of 19.5 by finishing in 19.41seconds – including a first 100m of 9.88 and a first 150m of 14.41seconds. He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League. Running over 200m, he finished in 19.76seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix, who returned from a year-long hiatus. A week later he attended the British Grand Prix <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> poor conditions, he gained a victory over his rival Asafa Powell with a 9.93-second run. He set a meet record of 19.72seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month, but expressed disappointment with his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him at the finish.|$|E
5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck {{that they should}} be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E
