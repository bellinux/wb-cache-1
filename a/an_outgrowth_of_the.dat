5|$|Mandarin square: Mandarin squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was embroidered with detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating {{the rank of}} the official wearing it. Mandarin squares were first authorized for wear in 1391 by the Ming Dynasty. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the Yuan Dynasty.

5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to three}} {{thoracic}} segments may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part {{or all of the}} thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propodus.

5|$|Changing teams again, James {{joined the}} Toronto Aeros in 1989. The Aeros had formed in 1974 as <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Annunciation team she played with as a child. She {{led the team}} to two {{national}} championships, in 1991 and 1993. In the first, she scored the only goal, against future national team teammate Manon Rheaume, in a 1–0 victory over Team Quebec. The 1993–94 season was a season in which James scored 40 goals and 70 points in 28 games. She continued to switch teams, joining the Toronto Red Wings/Newtonbrook Panthers franchise for a couple seasons before rejoining the Aeros in 1997. She remained with the team when it was rebranded the Beatrice Aeros in 1998 and joined the newly formed National Women's Hockey League (NWHL). James scored 38 goals and 55 points in the inaugural NWHL season of 1998–99 and was named the league's most valuable player. The following season, she was named the Western Division's best forward and on its First All-Star team. The Aeros won their first NWHL title dominating the Sainte-Julie Pantheres in the finals. Also OWHA champions, the Aeros catptured the women's nationals against Team Quebec. Once the season over, James retired from competitive hockey in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gut, {{forming a}} gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder {{was open to}} the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, {{there is much more}} oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{background}} that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595. The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha {{was the daughter of}} Charibert I, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent. Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times—possibly the current St Martin's Church. Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian Ian N. Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen. Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved. The mission may have been <b>an</b> <b>outgrowth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missionary efforts against the Lombards who, as pagans and Arian Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.|$|E
