2500|$|A {{combination}} of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and {{it was found that}} pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6km²) of land of which [...] was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (tree tomatoes) and feijoas. In 1934 Jim MacLoughlin had bought a [...] lemon and passionfruit orchard in No 3 Road. His neighbour Vic Bayliss had two Chinese gooseberry plants and he had sold the fruit for £5! Spurred on by this Jim planted ½ acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name “Kiwifruit” was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular. In 1998 “Zespri Gold” kiwifruit was introduced to the market and experiments are being carried out on new varieties including <b>a</b> <b>peelable</b> kiwifruit and [...] "kiwiberry", a small bite-sized kiwifruit-like fruit.|$|E

40|$|An NPR report {{yesterday}} {{on the opening}} of a new session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing began with a disparaging comment to the effect that China {{is still a long way}} from democracy. As a statement of fact, this is no doubt both true and lamentable. As an attempt to convey useful knowledge to American listeners about China’s current situation, however, it seems to me nearly useless. Like many such statements, it is based on an implicit comparison between the Chinese political system and Western-style democracy. And like many such implicit comparisons, it falls victim to a particularly seductive and misleading form of comparative fallacy. Any time we set out to compare two things, we need to identify and describe the differences and similarities between their corresponding parts. There’s no problem if we are comparing two equally familiar and equally distant objects by applying a neutral, objective standard of comparison. If I assert that granny apples have a green skin and sour flavor, while fuji apples have a golden skin and sweet flavor, I am unlikely to raise many hackles. If I claim that the average American’s diet is relatively high in saturated fat and low in fiber, which the average Chinese diet is the reverse, I’m again on reasonably solid ground. As soon as we allow one of the two objects under study to represent, implicitly or explicitly, a normative standard of comparison, we’re much more likely to produce skewed results. Imagine how a Washington apple would appear to a provincial Floridean who had encountered only naval oranges: as an abnormally hard orange with a dark smooth surface, lacking in internal sections and <b>a</b> readily <b>peelable</b> skin...|$|R
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{spray nozzle}} {{technology}} {{has been used to}} create films of indium tin oxide (ITO) in the formation of transparent conductive films (TCF). ITO has excellent transparency and low sheet resistance, however it is a scarce material and prone to cracking, which does not make it a good candidate for the new flexible TCFs. Graphene on the other hand can be made into a flexible film, extremely conductive and has high transparency. Ag nanowires (AgNWs) when combined with Graphene has been reported to be a promising superior TCF alternative to ITO. [...] Prior studies focus on spin and bar coating methods which are not suitable for large area TCFs. A multi-step process utilizing ultrasonic spray of graphene oxide and conventional spray of AgNWs followed by a hydrazine vapor reduction, followed by the application of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) topcoat resulted in <b>a</b> <b>peelable</b> TCF that can be scaled to a large size.|$|E
5000|$|Vegimals, the company's initial product, were velour and fur-covered {{vegetables}} and fruits, some with Velcro fastenings, which had embroidered faces. They included peas in a zippered pod (the most popular product), a tomato, a stalk of broccoli, a cauliflower, a giant carrot, {{a slice of}} watermelon with removable stuffed seeds, an olive with removable pit, <b>a</b> <b>peelable</b> and segmentable orange, a shuckable ear of corn, two peanuts in a peanut shell, and a banana with Velcro-fastened peel. Non-vegetable, non-fruit characters included an egg that unzipped to release a stuffed fried egg, a zippered can containing four Velcro-attached sardines, animals such as a fish inside a fish inside another fish, a whale with a baby inside, a mother sheep with lamb, and [...] "Emile Bearhart" [...] with a pocket containing a red velour heart, and also an 11-inch velour pyramid containing a blue velour mummy. In 1978 the company was producing 43 different types of Vegimal.|$|E

40|$|The {{heat sealing}} {{behavior}} of novel polyethylene-based nanocomposite films was investigated, as they re-late to flexible packaging of fresh-cut vegetables, processed foods and biomedical devices. Appropriately designed sealant nanocomposites, which include dispersed montmorillonite nanofillers and ethyl vinyl ac-etate copolymer, produce <b>a</b> hermetic but <b>peelable</b> heat seal across a broad, 30 – 40 ◦C, range of heat sealing temperatures, outperforming optimized commercial polyethylene-based sealants that achieve <b>peelable</b> seals in <b>a</b> much narrower heat sealing temperature range, {{of less than}} 15 ◦C. Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to a general easy-open/peelable character of heat seals, which is: (a) independent of sealing conditions and apparatus — ranging from long dwell times at very high sealing pressures to very short heat impulses at very low sealing pressures; (b) markedly independent of {{the opposite side of}} the heat seal — for example, when sealed on itself, on unfilled sealant, or on high density polyethylene; and (c) rather insensitive to for-mulation variations of the sealant — for example, variations of the polyethylene of the ethyl vinyl acetate type and concentration, and of nanofiller loading. Insights from observations of the fracture seal surfaces by infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that the underlying mechanism of this behavior is related to a synergistic effect of the ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer and the montmorillonite clay nanofiller...|$|R
40|$|As society ages {{there is}} a growing need to {{understand}} issues surrounding declining user capabilities. One such area has been accessibility of packaging by older people. To date much of the current research in this area has focused on measuring strength of older people and analysing the force needed to open various pack formats and has largely concentrated on accessibility of jam or sauce jars. However, a survey by 'Yours' magazine indicated that problems with thin film pack forms and peelable packaging was also an issue for older people. Hence the authors undertook a small-scale study to understand the issues surrounding accessing a rigid plastic container with <b>a</b> <b>peelable</b> lid. To that end the authors built a bespoke measuring device to measure container peeling forces, measured finger friction between pack and finger and undertook an observational analysis on 60 users accessing packaging of this type. Results indicated that the force needed to open containers of this type is lower than measured user forces including older people and it is therefore likely that the issues surrounding accessibility of this type of pack format are related to dexterity not strength. However, the authors also showed that this can be affected by context of use in that oily fingers could reduce the friction coefficient between finger and pack such that older people may not have sufficient strength to open packs of this type...|$|E
