50|$|Complications {{may occur}} {{immediately}} following the myocardial infarction or may take time to develop. Disturbances of heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and heart block can arise <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> ischemia, cardiac scarring, and infarct location. Stroke is also <b>a</b> risk, either <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> clots transmitted from the heart during PCI, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> bleeding following anticoagulation, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the infarction. Regurgitation of blood through the mitral valve is possible, particularly if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle. Cardiogenic shock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop, dependent on infarct size, and {{is most likely to}} occur within the days following an acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is the largest cause of in-hospital mortality. Rupture of the ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within the initial weeks. Dressler's syndrome, a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of pericarditis is also possible.|$|R

First to go was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General Nathan Twining. Soon after it was announced that Bradley would be replaced by Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Command, Collins would be succeeded by Ridgway, and Admiral William Fechteler, who had become CNO on the death of Sherman in July 1951, by Admiral Robert B.

For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor.

5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> transition into the public school system.|$|E
