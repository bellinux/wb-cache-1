5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in <b>a</b> <b>charitable</b> trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce <b>a</b> <b>charitable</b> trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create <b>a</b> <b>charitable</b> trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, <b>a</b> <b>charitable</b> trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
