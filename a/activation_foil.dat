40|$|Abstract. For the {{measurement}} of induced activity in the <b>activation</b> <b>foils,</b> various methods and instruments are used. When the activity is measured by using a beta counter {{it is very important}} to know the beta attenuation in the <b>activation</b> <b>foils.</b> The beta attenuation in the foil depends on the beta spectrum of the activation product, the material and the thickness of the material. The beta attenuation has been evaluated theoretically as well as experimentally. The detailed investigations of beta attenuation in the foils are presented in this paper. The experimental study was conducted using an absolute system, the 4 πβ-γ coincidence system. For the various foils like Au, Mn, Co, Al and Mg used in this study, it is found that both theoretical and experimental values for the beta attenuation are matching. The attenuation of betas in the foils varies with beta energy spectrum and the materials and it varies from 7 % to 92 %. The <b>foil</b> <b>activation</b> method is very accurate for the neutron fluence rate measurement. In <b>foil</b> <b>activation</b> method the induced activity is correlated to the neutron fluence rate. This activity is measured using different counters. 4 πβ-ϒ coincidence system is the primary standard for the activity measurement. If the activity is very low this system cannot be used for {{the measurement}}. 4 πβ flow type proportional counters are used for {{the measurement of}} activity. For this the efficiency of the foil should be known accurately. Evaluation of the beta efficiency of different <b>activation</b> <b>foils</b> is discussed in this paper.

The irradiation was driven by an 800 MeV 1 mA proton beam with a circular Gaussian shape of approximately 2 {sigma} = 3. 5 cm.

Triggered by the attacks of 11 September 2001, measures were undertaken to enhance maritime security in extension to the Safety Of Life At Sea Convention and {{in line with the}} US Container Security Initiatives. Effective detection techniques are needed that allow the inspector to intercept illicit trafficking of nuclear weapons components or components of other nuclear explosive devices. Many security measures focus on active interrogation of the container content by X-ray scan, which might be extended with the newly developed tagged neutron inspection system. Both active interrogation techniques can, with the current huge volume of container traffic, only be applied to a limited number of selected containers. The question arises whether a passive detection technique can offer an alternative solution. This study investigates if containers equipped with a small passive detector will register during transport the neutron irradiation by fissionable material such as plutonium in a measurable way. In practice, 4 / 5 of the containers are about 1 / 8 filled with hydrogenous material and undergo a typical 2 months route. For this reference case, {{it was found that the}} most compatible passive detector would be an <b>activation</b> <b>foil</b> of iridium. Monte Carlo simulations showed that for the reference case the activity of a 250 µm thin foil with 6 cm² cross section would register 1. 2 Bq when it is irradiated by a significant quantity of Reactor-Grade PuO 2. However this activity drops with almost two orders of magnitude for other fillings and other isotopic compositions and forms of the Pu-source. The procedure of selecting the target material for Pu detection is detailed with the theoretical methods, in order to be useful for other applications.

This irradiation system includes an exposure cave made with a lead-bismuth alloy, a cave positioning system, a gamma and neutron monitoring system, a sample transfer system, and interchangeable filters. This system was installed in the irradiation cell of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (NSCR). By increasing the thickness of the lead-bismuth alloy, the neutron spectra were shifted into lower energies by the scattering interactions of fast neutrons with the alloy. It is possible, therefore, by changing the alloy thickness, to produce distinctly different dose weighted neutron spectra inside the exposure cave of the FNIS. The calculated neutron spectra showed close agreement with the results of <b>activation</b> <b>foil</b> measurements, unfolded by SAND-II close to the cell window. However, there was a considerable less agreement for locations far away from the cell window. Even though the magnitude of values such as neutron flux and tissue kerma rates in air differed, the weighted average neutron energies showed close agreement between the MCNP and SAND-II since the normalized neutron spectra were in a good agreement each other. A paired ion chamber system was constructed, one with a tissue equivalent plastic (A- 150) and propane gas for total dose monitoring, and another with graphite and argon for photon dose monitoring. Using the pair of detectors, the neutron to gamma ratio can be inferred. With the 20 cm-thick FNIS, the absorbed dose rates of neutrons measured with the paired ion chamber method and calculated with the SAND-II results were 13. 7 ?? 0. 02 Gy/min and 15. 5 Gy/min, respectively. The absorbed dose rate of photons and the gamma contribution to total dose were 6. 7 ?? 10 - 1 ?? 1. 3 ?? 10 - 1 Gy/min and 4. 7 %, respectively. However, the estimated gamma contribution to total dose varied between 3. 6 % to 6. 6 % as the assumed neutron sensitivity to the graphite detector was changed from 0. 01 to 0. 03...|$|E

This new method require an isotopically highly-sensitive, non-destructive in sense of compactness as well as isotopic content, precise and standardly used analytical method for trace concentration determination. The capability of Prompt Gamma-ray Activation Analysis (PGAA) for determination of trace concentrations of transmuted stable nuclides in the metallic foils of Ni, Au, Cu and Nb, which were irradiated for 21 days in the reactor core at the LVR- 15 research reactor in Řež, is reported. The PGAA measurements of these <b>activation</b> <b>foils</b> were performed at the PGAA facility at Forschungs-Neutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRMII) in Garching...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed for neutron energy spectrum adjustment using the deconvolution method. The BUNKI-based algorithm has been implemented to converge quickly yielding calculated neutron energy spectrum which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The <b>foil</b> <b>activation</b> data {{have been used as}} an input for each unfolding technique and various <b>activation</b> <b>foils</b> including Au- 197, Al- 27, Ni- 58, Co- 59, and Mg- 24 covering thermal to fast energy range have been utilized. The group cross-section values were derived from the data given in the pre-processed cross-section libraries in ENDF- 6 format of IRDF- 90 /NMF-G. Firstly, virtual approach was used for neutron energy spectrum adjustment. In this case, the activity of foils before and after the adjustment was almost the same but the flux had the maximum error of 14 %. Secondly, the experimental measured activity of the threshold foils was then used for a real system. The activity of the threshold foils before and after the neutron energy adjustment had the maximum error of 33 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe energy {{spectrum}} of the Neutron Radiation Effects Program (NREP) beam line, Target-Moderator-Reflector- 1 (TMR- 1), at Indiana University has not been previously characterized. The facility has a unique proton source with variable pulse length (15 - 600 ms) and energy (13 MeV). Thus, it can produce a unique and tailored neutron beam when incident on a beryllium target. Through a combination of MCNP-X particle simulations, neutron activation experiments, and application of a spectrum unfolding code (SAND-II), the neutron source is characterized. Eight <b>activation</b> <b>foils</b> and wires were irradiated in the target area and the gamma activity measured. This information was used in an unfolding code, SAND-II, to deconvolve the spectrum, using the MCNP simulations {{as a basis for}} the spectral fitting...|$|R
