5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> He complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments {{to limit the}} president to a single six-year term and make {{the president and the}} Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted {{to do the same}} for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Creditors, such as Henry Crown, {{advocated}} for the shutdown and liquidation of the property.

25|$|Rhodes opposed native liquor {{trafficking}} and suppressed it {{entirely on the}} diamond mines {{at the risk of}} offending some of his supporters among the brandy-farmers of the western provinces. He also restricted it <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> on native reserves and territories. Nevertheless, liquor trafficking continued on colonial farms and to some extent on in native territory and reserves. The Khoikhoi were particularly fond of the drink as they had been almost completely demoralised from their military losses.|$|E

In September of the following year Herman was back in Albany Academy, in the Latin course. He also joined debating societies, in an apparent effort to make up <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> for his missed years of schooling. In this period he also became acquainted with Shakespeare's Macbeth at least, and teased his sisters with a passage from the witch scenes.|$|E
25|$|The Nationality Room {{programs}} {{began in}} 1926 when Bowman {{decided that he}} wanted to involve the community <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in constructing the Cathedral, so he proposed that each nationality that had a significant number of people in Pittsburgh would be allowed to design their nationality's room for the Cathedral. Each group had to form a Room Committee, which would be responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided only the room and, upon completion, upkeep for perpetuity. All other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes aided by foreign governments and the rooms contain many authentic artifacts and materials from the country represented. A typical room on the 1st floor (those built between 1938 and the 1957) took between three and ten years to complete, and cost the equivalent of US$300,000 in 2006 dollars. More recent rooms have cost in the range of $750,000 and up.|$|E

Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the time to find out <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E
