5|$|In 1939, the United States had renounced {{its trade}} treaty with Japan; and, {{beginning}} with an <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure. During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives by both sides, {{the war between}} China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces {{in the event of}} a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina. Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan. Other sanctions soon followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} the early 1930s, the {{four members of the}} Zara class took part in training exercises with the Italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Gorizia and Pola were involved in the Spanish Civil War; in 1936 Pola conducted non-intervention patrols and Gorizia carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France that year. After departing France, Gorizia visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> tank that forced her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty's displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them to stop in Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, Zara, Pola, and Gorizia provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{data on the}} heats of {{combustion}} {{and hydrogen}} contents {{of a number of}} <b>aviation</b> <b>gasolines</b> have been used in deriving a formula for computing net heat of combustion from (measured) gross heat of combustion. This formula appears to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose and has the advantage of making hydrogen determinations unnecessary. The data on heats of combustion are presented in tabular form, and in graphs showing the relation between net heat of combustion and (1) hydrogen content, (2) aniline point, (3) APO gravity, and (4) the product of aniline point and APO gravity. Data are given on the change in aniline point with time, and also the change resulting from the addition of xylidine...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Aviation</b> <b>gasolines</b> used in piston {{aircraft}} engines common in general aviation {{have a slightly}} different method of measuring the octane of the fuel. Similar to an AKI, it has two different ratings, although it is referred to only by the lower of the two. One {{is referred to as}} the [...] "aviation lean" [...] rating and is the same as the MON of the fuel up to 100. [...] The second is the [...] "aviation rich" [...] rating and corresponds to the octane rating of a test engine under forced induction operation common in high-performance and military piston aircraft. This utilizes a supercharger, and uses a significantly richer fuel/air ratio for improved detonation resistance.|$|R

25|$|The FBO is Southern Maine Aviation, {{which has}} Jet Fuel, <b>Aviation</b> <b>Gasoline</b> (100LL) and MoGas (usually available). They also operate an {{aircraft}} maintenance facility, a flight school and have facilities for transient flight crew and passengers.|$|E
50|$|Products include crude oil, {{which can}} be further refined into <b>aviation</b> fuel, <b>gasoline,</b> or diesel fuel using one or many {{upgrading}} processes. The test process converted between 50 and 70 percent of the algae's carbon into fuel. Other outputs include clean water, fuel gas and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.|$|R
5000|$|The Imperial Oil - Strathcona Refinery is an oil {{refinery}} located adjacent to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, owned by Imperial Oil. The refinery provides oil products, primarily <b>gasoline,</b> <b>aviation</b> fuel, diesel, lubricating oils, petroleum waxes, {{heavy fuel oil}} and asphalts.|$|R
50|$|Van Dyke {{developed}} {{a business plan}} to expand Atlantic's domestic and foreign markets, but domestic sales {{came to a halt}} when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917. Prior to U.S. involvement in the war, gasoline exports increased to the Allied Forces. As air forces emerged, the demand for <b>aviation</b> grade <b>gasoline</b> grew, and {{during the time of the}} U.S. involvement in World War I, fifty percent of the aviation fuel sent abroad was produced at Atlantic's Point Breeze Refinery.|$|R
25|$|For {{technical}} reasons {{the use of}} leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> such as 100LL, because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach {{without the use of}} leaded additives.|$|E
25|$|Moving to the Ohio State University in Columbus, Eicher {{helped in}} the {{preparation}} of <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> components such as triptane, a reference compound, which was sent to the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. He joined the American Chemical Society in 1943, later serving as an assistant secretary and as a councilor.|$|E
25|$|Today, most general {{aviation}} piston engine powered aircraft are naturally aspirated. Modern aviation piston engines designed {{to run at}} high altitudes typically include a turbocharger (either high pressure or turbonormalized) rather than a supercharger. The change in thinking {{is largely due to}} economics. <b>Aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> was once plentiful and cheap, favoring the simple, but fuel-hungry supercharger. As the cost of fuel has increased, the supercharger has fallen out of favor.|$|E

5000|$|In July of 2015, American Legend Aircraft and Superior Air Parts (makers of the Gemini engine) {{announced}} that the 100-horsepower Gemini turbo-charged diesel engine would be available in 2016 as an option throughout the American Legend product line. The engine burns widely available Jet A and/or diesel fuel; an important consideration as normal <b>aviation</b> 100LL <b>gasoline</b> is expensive or unavailable in many remote areas.

25|$|The {{original}} Wasp Jr {{radial engine}} of the Beaver is long out of production, so repair parts are getting harder to find. Some aircraft conversion stations have addressed this problem by replacing the piston engine with a turboprop engine such as the PT6. The added power and lighter installed weight, together with greater availability of kerosene fuel instead of high-octane <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline,</b> make this a desirable modification, but at a high financial cost.|$|E
25|$|Casablanca {{operated}} in the Strait of Juan de Fuca as a training ship for escort carrier crews {{from the time}} of her commissioning until August 1944. On 24 August, she cleared San Francisco, carrying men, airplanes, and <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> to Manus Island, a major base for western Pacific operations. Returning to Seattle, on 8 October, she resumed her training operations in Puget Sound until 22 January 1945, when she began a repair period at San Diego.|$|E
25|$|LN-7 was {{composed}} of three merchant vessels. Canatco had sailed from Quebec with the escort Shawinigan with Ericus, Donald Stewart and the escort Trail joining from convoy LN 6 off Gaspé which had been cancelled after U-boat attacks in the Strait of Belle Isle. Donald Stewart was a Great Lakes freighter carrying cement and 55-gallon drums of <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> lashed to its deck. After the groups had merged, the three merchant ships sailed in a line abreast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 Roy Fedden {{pressed the}} Air Ministry to import {{supplies}} of [...] 100 octane <b>aviation</b> spirit (<b>gasoline)</b> from the USA. This new fuel would allow aero engines {{to run at}} higher compression ratios and supercharger boost pressure than the existing 87-octane fuel, thus increasing the power. The Mercury XV {{was one of the}} first British aero engines to be type-tested and cleared to use the 100-octane fuel in 1939. This engine was capable of running with a boost pressure of +9lbs/sq.in and was first used in the Blenheim Mk IV.|$|R

25|$|World War II {{followed}} {{this period of}} exploration; Indiana Standard participated in the war effort, discovering new means of refinement and even a way of producing TNT more quickly and easily. In addition, Indiana Standard significantly contributed to the <b>aviation</b> and land <b>gasoline</b> needed for the Allied armies. Also, during the war Indiana Standard created its chemical division, formed from the merger of the Pan American Chemicals Company and the Indoil Chemical Company.|$|R
25|$|This {{system was}} given this name {{following}} an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators {{found that the}} plane had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar turboprop model, filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of avgas (<b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline).</b> There was enough avgas in the fuel system to taxi to the runway and take off, but then the jet fuel was drawn into the engines, causing them to stop.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> accumulating in {{the forward}} {{elevator}} pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{government}} was nearing completion of a major refinery at Rose Bluff just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, that would become {{the foundation of the}} company's manufacturing operation. Using designs developed by Cities Service and the Kellogg Co., the plant was dedicated only 18 months after the first concrete was poured. A month before Allied troops landed in France, it was turning out enough critically needed 100-octane <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> to fuel 1,000 daily bomber sorties from England to Germany. Government funding through the Defense Plant Corporation (DPC) also prompted Cities Service to build plants to manufacture butadiene, used to make synthetic rubber, and toluene, a fuel octane booster and solvent.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
