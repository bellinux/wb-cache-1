40|$|Magnesium alloys are {{the lightest}} {{structural}} materials, {{which makes them}} particularly suitable {{for use in the}} aircraft and automotive industry. However, due to hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, resulting in insufficient number of independent slip systems, magnesium alloys exhibit poor formability at room temperature. Conventional methods of work hardening of magnesium alloys requires the temperature about 300 °C, which favours simultaneously processes of thermal recovery and grain growth, but decreases beneficial microstructure strengthening effect. Thus, it is a crucial to undertake development of a technology for semi-finished magnesium alloys elements, which will ensure better mechanical properties of the final products by forming desirable microstructure.

The influence of the constitutive behavior on the deformation path is analyzed using two different plasticity criteria : Von Mises (isotropic), and Hill 48 (anisotropic).

40|$|Nickel-chromium-iron alloys, such as Alloy 600 and Alloy 690, {{are used}} in steam {{generator}} applications. While Alloy 600 steam generator tubes are prone to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), Alloy 690, which has a higher Cr-content, shows a superior corrosion resistance. So far it has not failed due to SCC, but the experience with this alloy is still limited to about 15 years of service. The objectives of this thesis work are to describe the texture and microstructure of Alloy 690 and to analyze {{the connection between the}} propagation/arrest of SCC in corrosion tested samples from steam generator tubes. The method of investigation was the Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique. Microtextures of single and double pilgered material are compared, as well as samples from tubes with different tube diameters. EBSD is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) -based technique that measures crystallographic orientation (i. e. texture) of a small volume of material. The EBSD technique provides microtexture information, such as orientation distributions and grain boundary crystallography. The samples were investigated using a Leo 1550 Gemini SEM (with field emission gun) employing an EBSD-unit in combination with a Hjelen detector. For this study the tubes have been tested by reverse U-bending (RUB) in a caustic environment with traces of lead. Three different tubes were studied, <b>a</b> single <b>pilgered</b> tube with <b>a</b> tube diameter of 22 mm, <b>a</b> double <b>pilgered</b> tube with <b>a</b> tube diameter of 22 mm and <b>a</b> single <b>pilgered</b> tube with <b>a</b> tube diameter of 17. 5 mm.

40|$|Foulger (this volume) {{writes that}} the Easter melting anomaly is located close to a ridge triple {{junction}} and is associated with <b>a</b> microplate. <b>Pilger</b> & Handschumacher (1981) showed that the Easter “hotspot ” could have produced both the Tuamotu and Nazca ridges {{as well as the}} Sala y Gomez trace, especially if the Hawaiian-Emperor bend were older than 43 Ma, significantly predating the triple junction and the Easter plate. The oblique trends of the Tuamotu and Nazca ridges to magnetic chrons implies that the first stress mechanism proposed by Beutel & Anderson (this volume) is not applicable, but the second, melting anomaly mechanism (also part of the “Plate ” model of Foulger) could still apply. Foulger also states, “The direction of propagation [of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain] changed by ~ 60 ° at ~ 47 Ma, {{at the time of the}} “bend ” … No corresponding change in the direction of Pacific plate motion occurred at this time … ” There is indeed no evidence of a change in Pacific plate motion relative to adjacent plates at 43 Ma. However, there are ~ 47 Ma kinks in motion loci of all adjacent continental plates relative to Pacific plate (Norton, 2000, Fig. 10). North and South American-Pacific loci show comparable deflections to the Hawaiian-Emperor bend. Loci of Pacific and Farallon (-Juan de Fuca) plate motion and North American and Hawaiian “hotspot ” motion are shown in Figure 1, interpolated at 5 Ma intervals, using parameters from Pilger, 2007.

The tornado intensified as it approached town, and barns and outbuildings were leveled or swept away at EF2 intensity. The tornado further intensified to a violent EF4 as it struck Pilger directly, killing one person, injuring many others, and damaging or destroying most structures in town. <b>As</b> the main <b>Pilger</b> tornado was approaching town, a second nearly identical tornado developed east {{of town and}} paralleled {{the path of the}} main tornado, causing minor tree and outbuilding damage. Numerous homes and businesses in Pilger were completely destroyed, with several leveled or swept away. Numerous brick buildings in the downtown area were heavily damaged or destroyed, and trees throughout the town were denuded and debarked. A grainery was destroyed, multiple cars were thrown and mangled, and a school building had much of its top floor destroyed. A church was completely leveled and partially swept away as the tornado exited the town. Past Pilger, the twin tornadoes continued northeast, with the main tornado debarking several trees at EF3 strength and tearing the roofs off of two homes, while the other tornado damaged several farms at EF2 strength and snapped multiple trees. Both tornadoes grew in size as the damage paths shifted closer to each other. The main Pilger tornado destroyed outbuildings and snapped trees and power poles at EF2 strength, while the other tornado reached EF3 strength, snapping a metal transmission pole, destroying several barns, and inflicting EF1 damage to a house {{at the edge of the}} path. Both tornadoes then reached EF4 strength simultaneously as the paths crossed. Numerous trees were completely debarked in this area, and two farm homes were swept away with only the basements remaining. One of these two homes was hit by both tornadoes. Vehicles were lofted in this area, over 300 head of cattle were killed, and a fatality occurred as the second tornado tossed a car from a road. After the tornadoes crossed paths, the second tornado veered to the north and destroyed an outbuilding, and tore the roof and some walls from a house at EF2 strength before lifting.

40|$|ALL THIS holiness about {{terrorism}} in the Middle East. No argument can or should diminish by one whit the tragedy and the iniquity {{of the murder of}} both Israeli civilians and Palestinian civilians, men, women and children. But if the mass media which portray this as some unique evil want to contribute to a more-or-less just solution, they really ought to look further. That would require at least an awareness, not now evident, of what has led up to the present excesses. And a dropping of any pretence that terrorism is practised by one side only. The Israeli terrorism is practised by the state. What do I mean by an “awareness”? Well, consider pictures of the bus bombing in southern Jerusalem on June 18. Nineteen of those aboard were killed, including some school students, and 50 passengers were injured. One large newspaper picture showed Ariel Sharon with a throng of police, inspecting the scene. The Prime Minister looks sombre. He is said to be looking towards a row of body bags by the road, the sight of which we are spared. One would hope that, across the mind of any editor who looked at that picture before publication, there floated the incongruity that here is Ariel Sharon, the old terrorist, upset now by the sight of terrorism. As an Israeli army commander in 1953, he controlled Unit 101, most notorious for the atrocity of Qibya village (66 Arab men, women and children slaughtered, many blown up with their houses). As Defence Minister in the early 1980 s, he was found, despite his denial, to be “indirectly responsible” for the massacre of some 800 refugees in the camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut, and lost his job. Now, as Prime Minister, he bears responsibility for the state terrorism. The eminent war crimes jurist Richard Goldstone has said, in effect, that there is enough evidence related to the Beirut massacre for him to be indicted as a war criminal. These things are well enough known for editors, foreign editors, leader writers and lesser beings to be aware of them. One hopes they would also be aware of something more of the modern history of strife between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and some of their history back to and before the Arab conquest of 15 centuries ago. Why? Because it might reveal to them that the Palestinians are in all fairness entitled - let me emphasise, entitled - to a state of their own - not a state by grace and favour of Israel and the United States, not a ridiculous non-state of separated enclaves with Israel in charge of its borders, its air space and its water supply, and certainly not a state put on demeaning probation but a nation-state in the full meaning of the term. Israel’s security? Nuclear weapons, great conventional power, the might of America - not armaments are needed, but friends. With a genuine state, Palestinian leaders would soon put their irreconcilables out of business and avoid mischief to avoid destruction. The modern history of strife in Palestine is usually counted from the late nineteenth century, when Palestine was still ruled by Turkey. Arab leaders could see Jewish immigration as a danger to their native land and culture, and Arab bands sometimes attacked Jewish settlements. They recognised that the Zionists planned eventually to take over what they considered to be the land of their ancestors (though any ethnic link with 19 th century European Jewry is said to be mythical). From 1920, by when Britain ruled Palestine under a League of Nations mandate, there were serious outbreaks of Arab violence against the growing Jewish population and the British who permitted immigration. The Jewish policy was generally one of self-restraint, but before World War 2 Jewish extremists had begun meeting terrorism with terrorism and, with bombs in public places, outstripping Arab violence. Terrorism was the method that helped get rid of the British after World War 2. The pinnacle of Jewish achievement came in 1946, when Zionist genius succeeded in blowing up the British headquarters in Palestine, Jerusalem’s famous King David Hotel. Some 90 people died, at least 15 of them Jews. Whether they received any warning is a matter of dispute; the perpetrators told some workers in a cafe to run for their lives, but if - as the planner of this operation claimed - there was a general warning, there was none given in time. The planner was Menachem Begin, who as an old terrorist became prime minister, like Mr Sharon after him. The official Jewish leadership disowned the King David operation as a dissident outrage. In fact, they had approved of it beforehand, though they had not expected such carnage. According to David Hirst, in his work The Gun and the Olive Branch: The Roots of Violence in the Middle East (Faber & Faber), it had long been standard practice for the official leadership to dissociate themselves from operations which they had sponsored or approved. The official Zionist leader David Ben Gurion said his organisation, the Jewish Agency, was not capable of suppressing terrorism: “We cannot do it because, as I told you, it is futile, sir, it is futile. ” Richard Crossman, the influential British Zionist, said Mr Ben Gurion “seems to want to have it both ways, to remain within {{the letter of the law}} as chairman of the Agency, and to tolerate terror as a method of bringing pressure on the Administration [the British Administration in Palestine]”. There is a striking parallel here: David Ben Gurion, the Jewish hero, founding Prime Minister of Israel after he declared the nation 2 ̆ 7 s independence in 1948, and Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Authority, would-be president of an independent Palestine, now under unceasing attack from Israeli and American leaders for tolerating Palestinian terrorism; both men disclaiming any connection with terrorism and apparently unable to prevent it. The Jewish terror continued, now in its bloodiest form, after the United Nations resolved in November 1947 that Palestine should be partitioned, a decision rejected by the Arabs. The slaughter in April 1948 of some 250 men, women and children of the harmless Arab village of Deir Yassin is well known. Hardly known yet is the atrocity of Al-Tantura, a scarcely defended village where more than 200 inhabitants, mostly unarmed young men, were massacred in May 1948. Neither village now exists. Professor Ilan Pappe, an historian at Haifa University (if his threatened expulsion has not come about) says recent research into Al-Tantura is historically important for the further light it throws on Israel 2 ̆ 7 s expulsion, direct and indirect, of some 750, 000 Palestinians, the systematic destruction of more than 400 villages and scores of urban neighbourhoods, as well as the perpetration of some 40 massacres of unarmed Palestinians. It was, of course, ethnic cleansing. 		 WHY HAVE the mass media, with the odd honourable exception, failed to tell the real story of the Palestinians and be fair towards them? They will say it isn’t their business to teach history, but there is more to it than that. The very adjectives that the mass media use in their reporting reveal a mind-set that is bent towards Israel. Any or all of many reasons may play a part: say, ignorance, admiration for Israel 2 ̆ 7 s strength, sympathy in the outrage suffered by Jewry in World War 2, an inadequate sense of fairness, cowardice in the face of the pro-Israeli lobby, simple racism [...] . It is fair to say that there seem to have been some signs of improvement in recent times, but a real awakening, not yet. And then there is the case of Mr Sam Kiley, reported in the Age last September, which leaves one to ponder another possibility. Mr Kiley resigned as Middle East correspondent of the Murdoch-controlled London Times, saying his reports were regularly censored by editors who were aware of Mr Murdoch 2 ̆ 7 s friendship with Ariel Sharon and of his investments in Israel. They lived in “terror” of irritating Mr Murdoch and went to water “every time a pro-Israeli lobby group wrote in with a quibble or complaint”. Mr Kiley instanced his finding and interviewing the Israeli soldiers who had shot a 12 -year-old boy, who in death had become a powerful symbol of the intifada; he was instructed by the Times to send copy “without mentioning the dead kid”. The Times disputed his version of events. Conrad Black - Lord Black actually - who controls the London Daily Telegraph and its Sunday partner, was annoyed when three well known contributors to his papers wrote to another Black publication, the Spectator magazine, complaining that “under Black 2 ̆ 7 s proprietorship, serious, critical reporting of Israel is no longer tolerated in the Telegraph Group”. Lord Black controls the Jerusalem Post; his wife is a Zionist and a newspaper columnist. His response: the letter of complaint showed “the depths of the problem of anti-Semitism in the British media”. True or false, anti-Semitism can be a damaging charge. In March, the Australian Jewish News published prominently on page 3 a garbled report falsely suggesting that John <b>Pilger</b> was anti-Jewish, <b>a</b> racist. This related to <b>a</b> <b>Pilger</b> article in the New Stateman on Tony Blair 2 ̆ 7 s role as Ariel Sharon 2 ̆ 7 s closest ally in Europe. Later there appeared prominently on Page 3 of the Jewish News an apology, accompanied by a photo of Mr Pilger. The paper was “happy to fully retract [the offending statement] and apologise to John Pilger for publication of the error”. HISTORICAL truth is important. Israel, like Australia, has tried to whitewash the unsavoury bits of the past, and the denigration of the Palestinians has been part of that process. But the Palestinians are victims of an historic injustice, at the hands of the United Nations and America as well as of Israel. It is time to make what amends can be made. • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald. This article is published by arrangement with the Adelaide Review...|$|R
