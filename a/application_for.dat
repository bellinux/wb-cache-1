5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages.

An <b>application</b> <b>for</b> such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on.
