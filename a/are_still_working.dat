5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> brewery {{horses in}} other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E

25|$|Decades {{into the}} desktop {{publishing}} revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type experience <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working,</b> and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so {{the misuse of}} the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces. At the same time, with new printing techniques, typefaces have largely replaced hand-lettering for very large signs and notices that would once have been painted or carved by hand.|$|E
25|$|The carmine dye {{was used}} in Central America in the 15th century for {{coloring}} fabrics and became an important export good during the colonial period. After synthetic pigments and dyes such as alizarin were invented in the late 19th century, natural-dye production gradually diminished. Health fears over artificial food additives, however, have renewed the popularity of cochineal dyes, and the increased demand has made cultivation of the insect profitable again, with Peru being the largest exporter. Some towns in the Mexican state of Oaxaca <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> in handmade textiles using this cochineal.|$|E

25|$|Governments use {{different}} kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the business sector, or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically, taxes on the poor supported the nobility; modern social-security systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working.</b> In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (a government's strategy for doing this is called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.|$|E
25|$|Lois first {{appeared}} in season four as a recurring character but was made part of the regular cast after several episodes. Lois was introduced as the cousin of Chloe Sullivan. The series explored her progression from rebellious teenager to resolute investigative reporter. She began as an annoyance to Clark Kent during season four, but slowly their relationship evolved with Lois demonstrating an insight into Clark even in his more private moments. Eventually, she became his love interest in season eight and his fiancée in the final tenth season. Clark and Lois had a wedding ceremony in the series finale of the show, but the ceremony was interrupted by the coming of Darkseid and Apokolips. The series ends with Clark finally becoming Superman, and a flash forward seven years into the future, where Clark and Lois <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> at the Daily Planet and still {{trying to find the}} right time to get married.|$|E

Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working.</b> But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E
500|$|McCarthy's {{involvement}} with the ongoing cultural phenomenon that would bear his name began with a speech he made on Lincoln Day, February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia.

500|$|Running {{the episode}} out of {{sequence}} produced several notable continuity errors. For example, Bayliss and Pembleton <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> on the Adena Watson murder, which they had stopped investigating in the earlier episode [...] "Three Men and Adena". Additionally, Officer Thormann is seen onscreen working and healthy, although he was blinded in the earlier episode [...] "" [...] {{as a result of}} a gunshot wound to the head that forced him to leave the police department. These consistency errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order. The Watson case depicted in the episode was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series.|$|E
