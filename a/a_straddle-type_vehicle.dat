30|$|In this paper, ADAMS, one multi-body {{dynamics}} software, is used {{to calculate}} the wheel–rail coupling dynamics of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{lateral span}} of the walking wheels in <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} <b>vehicles</b> is very short. Hence, steady wheels must be set to improve the capsizing resistance of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicles.</b> The vehicle capsizing resistance is usually evaluated based on the buoyant center height and flexibility coefficient. In the UIC 505 - 5 regulation, the flexibility coefficient is defined as follows: When a vehicle stays on a line with a superelevation of δ, by assuming that the angle between the cross-section centerline of the vehicle and centerline and the line cross-section centerline perpendicular to the track top plane is ϕ, the ratio of ϕ to δ is the flexibility coefficient S.|$|R
50|$|The Hitachi small-type {{monorail}} is <b>a</b> <b>straddle-type</b> monorail {{built by}} Hitachi Ltd. {{for the use}} on the Sentosa Express. These trains are part of Hitachi line of ALWEG based monorail. The trains {{were part of a}} project to replace Sentosa's previous aging monorail system. The trains are fully air-conditioned.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{advantages}} including strong adaptability {{to complex}} terrain, low land occupancy, moderate freight volume and low construction cost, straddle-type monorail transportation systems have already {{become the first}} choice of urban railway systems in small–medium cities, mountainous cities and cities with topographic and geological complexity [1]. The <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle</b> is mainly supported, guided and stabilized by a single-track beam. The vehicle straddles and runs on the track beam, with the center of gravity of its body located above the track. Comparing to traditional railway vehicles, the running gears of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicles</b> use rubber tires, with guide wheels and steady wheels set {{on both sides of the}} track beam. The track beam has a simple structure, playing the roles of bearing structure and track structure. Thus, the performance of the structure can be fully maximized while the maintenance workload of the track beam is of little requirement [2].|$|R
30|$|The multi-body {{dynamics}} UM {{software is}} utilized {{to construct the}} single-vehicle dynamic model. Via simulation, its dynamic performance was analyzed. Dynamic analysis {{results indicated that the}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle</b> designed in this study has a favorable curve passing-through motion performance. When the A-level road spectrum coefficient is 0.5, the stability index of the monorail vehicle is excellent within the speed range of 90  km/h.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{monorail}} was put {{in operation}} in 1970 s, {{it has not been}} accepted much in the world for a long time; The maximum distance of the monorail operated in the whole world was less than 100  km until 2004, which is the cause that its research is not comprehensive, especially on straddle-type monorail track vertical coupling dynamics, so far, there were very few studies, and the works about the vertical dynamics of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle</b> were almost zero.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} <b>vehicle</b> single-axle bogie is developed. The vertical suspension system uses tumbler structure. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework bottom via rotational joints, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. The lateral suspension system uses suspenders. Lateral elasticity was provided by the lateral oscillation of the suspenders. The deflection between the carbody and bogie during the motion when passing through curves is adapted by the vertical oscillation of the suspenders. The guide wheels and steady wheels rotates around the horizontal axle {{at the end of the}} framework. Rubber springs are set between the spindles and framework, and make it easier to adjust the pre-compressive pressure between the steady wheels and guide wheels.|$|R
3000|$|According to {{parameters}} {{listed in}} Table  1, the flexibility coefficient {{of this new}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle</b> can be calculated based on Eq.  3. When all the guide wheels are {{in contact with the}} steady wheels at the same time, the flexibility coefficient is 0.284. When steady wheels on one side and guide wheels on the opposite side leave the track surface, the flexibility coefficient is 0.651. According to the definition of the flexibility coefficient, the greater the flexibility coefficient, the easier it is for the vehicle to capsize on the curves. Hence, to ensure a favorable anti-overturning capacity of the straddling monorail vehicles, a certain degree of preload pressure should be applied on the guiding or stabilizing wheels to guarantee a consistent contact between the wheels and track beam.

30|$|In view of {{the fact}} that {{exhibits}} monorail transportation in recent years, the good situation and the lack of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail <b>vehicle</b> vertical dynamics research, the key problems of vertical vibration were studied in this paper: The vertical coupling is between walking tires and finger-band. A dynamic model based on the vertical equivalent stiffness of tire is proposed, the force mode of the tire is determined through the comparison calculation and the dynamics model between walking tires and finger band was established on ADAMS Dynamics Software. By dynamic calculation, the vibration of four running wheels in time and frequency domains is obtained, and the vibration of the front axle of the front bogie is studied in detail; the correctness of the model is confirmed by comparing with the real vehicle test. Finally, the limitations of this paper and the direction of follow-up work are discussed.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of single-axle bogie of <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} <b>vehicle</b> is designed. The tumbler structures are adopted in the vertical suspension system. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. In addition, the lateral suspension utilizes the suspender way, with longitudinal force transmitted via single pull rods. Guide wheels and steady wheels are connected to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs, the pre-compressed magnitudes of which could be adjusted, are set between the spindles and support arms. The multi-body dynamics software UM is adopted to construct a dynamic model and simulate related dynamic performance. The results of the simulation indicate that this new kind of bogie has a favorable performance when passing through curves and has a greater riding stability. The flexibility factor equation of this new monorail vehicle is deduced, with its flexibility factor obtained.|$|R
