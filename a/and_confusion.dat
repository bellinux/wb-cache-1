5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is a {{condition}} in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of the muscle breakdown products, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.|$|E

5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E

A total of 74 of such errors/confusions were found with most being made about beliefs at “B” (n = 59), particularly about irrational beliefs (n = 38).

Simultaneously, the base experiences a power outage, <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> ensues, with neither Haddock nor Wolff capable of explaining clearly what happened.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> during the episode. Both she and McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in the tent with Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory {{received}} air threat {{warnings that}} it filtered to remove duplication, doubt <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields. No. 11 Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, <b>and</b> <b>confusion</b> occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord <b>and</b> <b>confusion.</b> One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E
