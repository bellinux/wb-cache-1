2500|$|Based upon a {{view that}} life begins at conception, Protestant author Randy Alcorn rejects all forms of {{hormonal}} contraceptives, while James Dobson and obstetrician and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view progesterone-only birth control pills as potentially problematic, since they may be potentially abortive contraceptives because of the theoretical possibility {{that they may have}} a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized embryo from implanting within the uterine wall, while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards. Dobson's Focus on the Family states,Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC {{has not been able to}} reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect.</b> A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> , however remote, to warrant informing women about it.|$|E
50|$|Neem {{seed oil}} {{has also been}} found to prevent {{implantation}} and may even have an <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> similar to pennyroyal, juniper berries, wild ginger, myrrh and angelica. The effects were seen as many as ten days after fertilization in rats though it was most effective at {{no more than three}} days. (Sinha, et al., 1984); (Lal et al., 1985). In a study on rats, neem oil was given orally eight to ten days after implantation of the fetus on the uterine wall. In all cases, by day 15, the embryos were all completely resorbed by the body. The animals regained fertility on the next cycle showing no physical problems. Detailed study of the rats revealed increased levels of gamma interferon in the uterus. The neem oil enhanced the local immune response in the uterus.(Mukherjee, 1996) Post coital use of neem oil as birth control does not appear to work by hormonal changes but produces changes in the organs that make pregnancy no longer viable (Tewari, 1989) (Bardham, 1991).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heracleumpersicum is an Iranian {{medicinal}} plant {{which is used}} for various diseases. However, {{there is no scientific}} evidence to prove its side effects in pregnancy. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the teratogenic and abortifacient effects of Heracleum persicum hydroalcholic extract in Balb/c mice. METHODS: In this experimental study, 30 Balb/c mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, after mating and vagina platelets observation. First group received nothing, and second group received distilled water (gavage) and the third roup received 12. 5 mg/kg/day Heracleum persicum hydroalcholic extract for 7 days. In 18 - 19 th day of the experiment, caesarean surgery was done and embryos were collected in normal saline. The embryos weight and heights were measured and any defects in skeleton or other observable defects in other parts were evaluated. Estrogen and progesterone levels were also measured to evaluate the mechanisms. FINDINGS: There was a significant difference in estrogen percentage (13. 82 ± 9. 09 ng/ml in case group vs. 2. 4 ± 0. 4 ng/ml in control group) and in progesterone percentage (24. 56 ± 18. 5 ng/ml in case group vs. 52. 46 ± 1. 35 ng/ml in control group) between two groups (p< 0. 05). The <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> of the plant was supported by the changes in blood estrogen and progesterone. The percentage of abortifacient was 0. 55 ± 0. 14 in plant group and zero in control group. There was no significant difference in studied groups regarding embryos heights. However, the embryos weights were less in case group (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Considering plant effect on weight and hormone changes in pregnancy and <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> of Heracleum persicum in experimental group, its consumption should be with cautious during pregnancy. © 2014, Babol University of Medical Sciences.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease often affects women {{during their}} {{reproductive}} years, causing management concerns for obstetricians caring for these patients during pregnancy. TREATMENT: Apart from methotrexate, most drugs used regularly to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can safely {{be used by}} pregnant women. No causal relationship has been established between exposure to sulfasalazine or other 5 -aminosalicylic acid drugs {{and the development of}} congenital malformations and these drugs may be used with relative safety during pregnancy and lactation. Current evidence indicates that maternal use of azathioprine and mercaptopurine is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, though impaired foetal immunity, intrauterine growth retardation and prematurity are occasionally observed. Cyclosporin is not teratogenic, but may be associated with growth retardation and prematurity. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy should be avoided in women treated with methotrexate because of its known <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effects</b> and risk of causing typical malformations. There is no actual evidence of adverse effect in pregnant women receiving Infliximab but the amount of clinical information is small. The treatment with metronidazole or ciprofloxacin for short durations appear to be safe, but there is no data about the effects of increased length of treatment as required in Crohn's disease remains unknown. Control of disease activity before conception and during pregnancy is critical to optimise both maternal and foetal health. A multidisciplined approach involving both obstetrician and gastroenterologist and education about pregnancy are essential components of the treatment of any young women with IBD...|$|R

In order to study teratogenic potential of Lapachol, pregnant Wistar rats were treated with 0. 5 ml of distilled water (control group); 0. 5 ml of hydroalcoholic solution (vehicle group) and 10 mg of Lapachol in 0. 5 ml of hydroalcoholic solution (treated group) by oral gavage from the 8 th to the 12 th day of pregnancy. The following variables were observed: maternal body weight on days 1, 6, l 5 and 21 and food intake on days 2, 6, 15 and 21 of pregnancy. The number of live and dead fetuses and the sites of resorptions were counted. The ovaries were weighed and the corpora lutea were counted.

40|$|Objectives: Stachys lavandulifolia is {{commonly}} used for many health problems including anxiety. A couple of reports indicate that this plant might have an <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> on pregnant women. Here we examined this effect on pregnant mice. Materials and methods: Incremental doses of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg of the extracts or normal saline (control group) were injected intraperitoneally to the pregnant mice between 7 th to 12 th days of pregnancy. On day 16, uterine tubes were resected and absorbed fetuses were counted. Results: Our study showed that the different average of absorbed fetuses between treated and control groups is significant (P < 0. 05). S. lavandulifolia changes the activity level of hypothalamus-pituitary gland-gonad axis due to flavonoid compounds. Also, S. lavandulifolia decreases progesterone concentration resulting in {{a significant difference between}} treated and control groups (P < 0. 05) and gives rise to failure in fetus survival and consequently, abortion. The length and weight of fetuses decreased in treated groups and {{there was a significant difference}} between treated and control groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Owing to the possible abortive effect of Stachys lavandulifolia, it is highly recommended to use it cautiously during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|If personhood {{begins at}} the moment of conception, the failure of an embryo to implant results in the death of a person. Therefore, many in the pro-life {{community}} worry about the ethics of using oral contraceptives, if such hormonal birth control actually interferes with implantation (a so-called “abortifacient ” effect). Obviously killing is wrong, and death should be avoided. However, even if contraceptives occasionally prevent implantation, a very good case can still be made in favor of their use. This paper seeks to show how contraceptives, even if they cause implantation failure, can be used with a clear conscience. Life is sacred, and almost all of us can agree with that. Yet even under optimal conditions, 40 % of all embryos fail to implant (Diedrich et al, 2007). That {{is a great deal of}} death that is often not taken into account. In keeping with the principle of saving life, we have the duty to avoid implantation failure if possible. There is no strong scientific evidence that contraceptives have an <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect.</b> However, even if they do interfere with implantation in a small percentage of cases, the actual number cannot be very large.

40|$|Brucella melitensis strain Rev. 1 is {{the most}} {{effective}} vaccine against brucellosis in sheep and goats. In Iran, mass vaccination is carried out all over the country in which adult animals are immunized by subcutaneous injection of reduced doses of the vaccine. However, due to antibody responses elicited by vaccination, concomitant implementation of test-andslaughter is impossible. To overcome the problem, vaccination through conjunctival route is recommended. In this study, serological responses of six pregnant Iranian fat-tailed ewes to conjunctival vaccination with standard doses of the vaccine were evaluated using modified Rose Bengal test, serum agglutination test and indirect ELISA. Besides, vaccine strain excretion in milk and vaginal discharges was also examined by microbiological culture of milk and vaginal swab samples taken one day post-parturition. Animals were vaccinated {{during the second half of}} gestation. As the results, antibody titers of five (83. 3 %) ewes decreased to the levels not detectable by the tests within three months after vaccination. No vaccine-induced abortions occurred and vaccinated ewes delivered healthy lambs 50. 33 ± 15. 56 (mean ± standard deviation) days post-vaccination. Vaccine strain was not isolated from milk and vaginal swab samples. Generally, our study shows full doses of B. melitensis strain Rev. 1 can be used conjunctively to vaccinate pregnant Iranian sheep during late pregnancy without <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effects,</b> prolonged antibody responses and vaccine strain excretion in milk and vaginal discharges. Nevertheless, further studies are required to determine safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{medicine}} {{is an ancient}} practice that has been gaining acceptance of the medical class through scientific studies that prove its effectiveness. However, its use should still be cautious. Medicinal plants have potential toxic effects not yet discovered, and may have unproven interactions with other medications. The use of drugs during pregnancy is still very dangerous and vigorously studied; however, there are few studies of herbal medicines in pregnant women. Existing studies prioritize on teratogenic or <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effects.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the toxic effects of Mikania glomerata Sprengel administration, popularly known as “guaco” during the gestational period of hypertensive rats. For this experimental groups consisting of pregnant Wistar rats received treatments with guaco extract (1 to 2 mL). In order to analyze the possible toxic effects of guaco during pregnancy, weight gain of rats was assessed during pregnancy; reproductive performance of rats, morphological parameters, and fetal placental histology were compared. Although some parameters presented significant differences, we can conclude that changes prioritized by literature, such as toxicity, vasodilation and hypotension, have not been caused by guaco. The only fetal changes observed were due to the maternal hypertension. Some studies have reported vasodilator and hypotensive effects of guaco. However, only a few studies exist, and its actual effects remain unknown. Specific studies should be developed with higher doses of guaco for a definitive conclusion of its toxic and non-toxic effects...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{fruit of}} Cucumis sativus {{a plant that}} has long been used in oriental {{medicine}} for its anti inflammatory, antidiabetic, and <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effects.</b> Cucumis sativus belonging to Cucurbitaceae family is commonly known as Cucumber. Based on its traditional use the fruit of the plant was selected for free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities. In this study we planned to study hepatoprotective effect of aqueous extract of Cucumis sativus fruit against cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, using accelerated cytotoxicity mechanisms screening (ACMS) techniques in isolated Sprague–Dawley rat hepatocytes as a cellular model. Method: Fresh fruits of Cucumis sativus were cleaned, and then dried in shade at room temperature and aqueous extract of the fruit was obtained. Hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion of the liver and viability was assessed by plasma membrane disruption determined by trypan blue (0. 2 w/ v) exclusion test. To determine the rate of hepatocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by cumene hydroperoxide, dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was added to the hepatocytes. The latter then reacts with ROS to form the highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which effluxes the cell. The fluorescence intensity of DCF was measured. Results: In the present study, the antioxidative potential of Cucumis sativus was evaluated in isolated rat hepatocytes and we tried to figure out whether Cucumis sativus could protect hepatocytes against cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) induced-cytotoxicity and ROS formation. Our results showed that when isolated hepatocytes were incubated with CHP, there was an initial rapid increase in ROS formation, which was prevented by aqueous extract of Cucumis sativus fruit. Conclusions: Our results showed that aqueous extract of Cucumis sativus acts as a hepatoprotective and antioxidant agent against CHP-induced hepatotoxicity suggesting that antioxidants and radical scavenging components of Cucumis sativus fruit extract can easily cross the cell membrane and cope with the intracellular ROS formation...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to its well-known <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect,</b> mifepristone (MIF) {{has been used as}} an anticancer drug for various cancers in many studies with an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action. However, application of MIF is limited by its poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability. In this work, we developed a drug delivery system based on chitosan nanoparticles (CNs) to improve its bioavailability and anticancer activity. The MIF-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (MCNs) were prepared by convenient ionic gelation techniques between chitosan (Cs) and tripolyphosphate (TPP). The preparation conditions, including Cs concentration, TPP concentration, Cs/MIF mass ratio, and pH value of the TPP solution, were optimized to gain better encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity (DL). MCNs prepared with the optimum conditions resulted in spherical particles with an average size of 200 nm. FTIR and XRD spectra verified that MIF was successfully encapsulated in CNs. The EE and DL of MCNs determined by HPLC were 86. 6 % and 43. 3 %, respectively. The in vitro release kinetics demonstrated that MIF was released from CNs in a sustained-release manner. Compared with free MIF, MCNs demonstrated increased anticancer activity in several cancer cell lines. Pharmacokinetic studies in male rats that were orally administered MCNs showed a 3. 2 -fold increase in the area under the curve from 0 to 24 h compared with free MIF. These results demonstrated that MCNs could be developed as a potential delivery system for MIF to improve its anticancer activity and bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Abortion {{is often}} a {{difficult}} and traumatic decision {{for a woman to}} make. Perhaps greater distress occurs when a woman commences a medical abortion but then changes her mind and wishes to keep the now-threatened pregnancy. One published case series detailed a potential method to counter/reverse the <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effect</b> of mifepristone by administering parenteral progesterone in such situations. Objectives: The present report details cases of women in similar circumstances who have been treated with progesterone. The aims were to document occurrences of where women have changed their mind after commencing medical abortion, as well as to explore some of the controversies and clinical issues surrounding their circumstances. Methods: Women who had commenced medical abortion by ingesting mifepristone but who had not taken misoprostol independently contacted a national pregnancy support service the same day. Those meeting criteria for treatment received progesterone 200 [*]mg pessaries per vaginum twice-daily for two weeks. Results: Cases: 28 -year-old woman, 6 weeks plus 1 [*]day gestation; 35 -year-old woman, 8 weeks plus 5 days gestation; and 27 -year-old woman, 7 weeks plus 3 days gestation. Outcomes respectively were: healthy male baby delivered at 39 weeks gestation; healthy male baby delivered at term; and completed medical abortion. Conclusions: Women have changed their mind after commencing medical abortion. Progesterone use in early pregnancy is low risk and its application to counter the effects of mifepristone in such circumstances may be clinically beneficial in preserving her threatened pregnancy.

40|$|Care of {{pregnant}} women with multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging because of the multiple physiological changes associated with pregnancy {{and the need to}} consider the impact of any intervention on the foetus. Pregnancy is associated with clinical MS stability or improvement, while the rate of relapse rises significantly during the first three months post-partum before coming back to its level prior to pregnancy. Gestational history has no influence on long-term disability and MS does not seem to influence pregnancy or the child's health. Apart from methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, most drugs used regularly to treat MS can safely be used by pregnant women. Intravenous steroids may be used with relative safety during pregnancy. Maternal use of azathioprine is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, though impaired foetal immunity, intrauterine growth retardation and prematurity are occasionally observed. Cyclosporin is not teratogenic, but may be associated with growth retardation and prematurity. Pregnancy should be avoided in women treated with methotrexate because of its known <b>abortifacient</b> <b>effects</b> and risk of causing typical malformations. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic in animals, but population studies have not conclusively demonstrated its teratogenicity in humans. Until information is available regarding safety, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, interferon-beta- 1 a and interferon-beta- 1 b should be discontinued before an anticipated pregnancy. Women with MS are no more likely to experience delivery complications than are women without MS and the mode of delivery should be decided strictly on obstetrical criteria. Spinal, epidural and general anaesthesia can all be used safely in MS patients. Young women with MS who desire children can be reassured that their infants are not at increased risk of malformations, preterm delivery, low birth weight, or infant death. The progressive nature of the disease may motivate affected women to start or complete their families as soon as possible...|$|R

Blood samples were collected for assay of progesterone (P- 4) {{and each of the}} antiprogestins (pre-treatment, daily GD 23 - 28, every other day GD 30 - 40), and animals were monitored sonographically through out gestation. Results of these studies indicated high rates of abortion with IM administration (3 / 5 mifepristone, 4 / 5 HRP 2000) and 5. 0 mg/kg oral route (4 / 5, 2 / 5, respectively), with less effects noted at oral doses of 0. 5 mg/kg (2 / 5, 0 / 5, respectively). No early abortions were observed in the control groups. Following daily IM treatment, peak levels of 8 - 16 ng/ml mifepristone were detected whereas 6 - 10 ngl mi of HRP 2000 were noted (GD 26 - 27). No serum levels of mifepristone were detected following either of the oral doses whereas serum levels of 2 - 6 ng/ml HRP 2000 were noted with high dose oral administration. Results of these studies suggest: (1) both antiprogestins are roughly comparable in terminating early pregnancy although HRP 2000 may be more efficacious when administered IM whereas mifepristone may be more effective when administered orally; (2) similar levels of biological activity are seen with the IM and high dose oral dosing regimens, with little or no activity with the oral low dose; and (3) infants resulting from surviving pregnancies were not affected by early gestation exposure...|$|R

J Mater Fetal Med 1999; 7 (3) : 115 – 9], and one oral misoprostol with gemeprost [Bartley J, Baird DT. A randomised study of misoprostol and gemeprost in combination with mifepristone for induction of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. Br J Obstetr Gynaecol 2002; 109 (11) : 1290 – 4]. Vaginal misoprostol compared with cervagem was associated with reduced narcotic analgesia (3 studies, 169 women, RR 0. 64 95 % CI 0. 49 – 0. 84), and surgical evacuation of the uterus (5 studies, 319 women, RR 0. 71 95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 95). No other statistically significant differences were observed for other outcomes with reported data. In the single trial comparing oral misoprostol with gemeprost, reported outcomes were similar. Conclusions Vaginal misoprostol for the termination of second and third trimester of pregnancy appears as effective as cervagem, but information about maternal safety is limited. Jodie M.
