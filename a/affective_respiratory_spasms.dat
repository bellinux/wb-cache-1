40|$|The {{alkaloid}} ricinine {{isolated from}} the plant Ricinus communis, when administered to mice at high doses, induces clonic seizures accompanied by electroencephalographic alterations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. the lethal nature of ricinine-induced seizures {{is considered to be}} a good model for the study of the events that cause death during clonic seizures, particularly those related to <b>respiratory</b> <b>spasms.</b> the initial signs (pre-seizure period) were marked by exophthalmus and decreased locomotor behavior. Animals killed during the preseizure period presented an increased utilization rate (HVA/DA) of dopamine (DA), an increased concentration of noradrenaline (NA), and a decreased concentration of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau), and serotonin (5 -HT) in the cerebral cortex. the seizure period is characterized by the occurrence of hind limb myoclonus and <b>respiratory</b> <b>spasms,</b> which are followed by death. Alterations in the cerebral cortex concentration of these neurotransmitters persisted during the seizure period. These alterations are only partially observed in the hippocampus, mainly during the seizure period. the present results suggest that an increased release of Glu in the cerebral cortex can be implicated in the genesis of the ricinine-induced seizure and that it triggers many anticonvulsive mechanisms, like the release of Tau, DA, 5 -HT, and NA.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} introduces ricinine-elicited seizures as a novel chemical model of convulsive seizure. Ricinine, a neutral alkaloid {{obtained from the}} plant Ricinus communis, induces seizures when administered to mice at doses higher than 20 mg/kg. Animals presenting sei zures showed a marked preconvulsive phase followed by short duration hind limb myoclonus: <b>respiratory</b> <b>spasms,</b> and death. the lethal nature of ricinine seizures is also pointed out as a good model to study the events causing death in clonic seizures, particularly those related to <b>respiratory</b> <b>spasms,</b> which are also observed in some types of human epilepsy. the behavioral signs of ricinine-elicited seizures are accompanied by electrographic alterations more evident during the preconvulsive phase in the cerebral cortex and more intense during the ictal phase both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. the ricinine-elicited seizures may be inhibited by diazepam but not by phenobarbital, phenytoin, or ethosuximide. Micromolar concentrations of ricinine cause a small decrease in the binding of [H- 3]-flunitrazepam to cerebral cortex membranes, but do not alter the binding of other radioligands to AMPA, 5 -HT 1 A, muscarinic, and alpha(1) -adrenergic receptors. Although ricinine presents a cyanide radical, only higher doses of ricinine (4 mM) caused a small impairment of mitochondrial respiration. These {{results suggest that the}} mechanism of action of ricinine probably involves the benzodiazepine site in the GABA, receptor. This may represent a new mechanism of drug-elicited seizures that may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} epilepsy and to new therapeutic approaches to this disease.

40|$|Infusion. Vernonia polyanthes Less. species, populary {{known as}} 'assa-peixe', have been {{described}} as a medicinal plant. The balsamics, expectorantings and hemostactics properties of this plant are well known, making it an <b>affective</b> medicine to <b>respiratory</b> system diseases. The diurectic and hypotensive properties are little investigated, so the aim of this work is to study it. The infusion of this plant's leaves was orally administered in anesthetized Wistar rats. The arterial pressure was evaluated by carotid artery canulation, conected to a manometer of mercury and the diuresis was registered by urinary bladder canulation. The rats of the control group received 1 ml of physiological solution, while the animals of the experimental group received 1 ml of infusion of 'assa-peixe', through an oral canula. The results showed a significant decrease in arterial pressure, as well a significant increase in urinary flux and sodium output. It is concluded that the 'assa-peixe' infusion presents hipotensive and natridiurectic properties when administered to anesthetized Wistar rats...|$|R
40|$|Sodium cyanide poison is {{potentially}} a more humane method to control wild dogs than sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison. This study quantified the clinical signs {{and duration of}} cyanide toxicosis delivered by the M- 44 ejector. The device delivered a nominal 0. 88 g of sodium cyanide, which caused the animal to loose the menace reflex in a mean of 43 s, and the animal was assumed to have undergone cerebral hypoxia after the last visible breath. The mean time to cerebral hypoxia was 156 s for a vertical pull and 434 s for a side pull. The difference was possibly because some cyanide may be lost in a side pull. There were three distinct phases of cyanide toxicosis: the initial phase was characterised by head shaking, panting and salivation; the immobilisation phase by incontinence, ataxia and loss of the righting reflex; and the cerebral hypoxia phase by a tetanic seizure. Clinical signs that were exhibited {{in more than one}} phase of cyanide toxicosis included retching, agonal breathing, vocalisation, vomiting, altered levels of ocular reflex, leg paddling, tonic muscular <b>spasms,</b> <b>respiratory</b> distress and muscle fasciculations of the muzzle...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{post-operative}} pain is a {{major problem}} which is not well addressed clinically; with patients regularly reporting significant pain following surgery (Clark, 2006). The possible harmful effects of untested surgical pain include: deep vein thrombosis, increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, <b>respiratory</b> infection, muscle <b>spasms,</b> increase post-operative stress, anxiety, fear, sleeplessness, and possible chronic pain (Clark, 2006). The {{purpose of this study is}} to: (a) obtain local data on surgical pain intensity and patient satisfaction, (b) degree of pain relief, (c) satisfaction with pain healthcare provider’s responsiveness to patients’ reports of pain. This is a replication of Chung and Lui’s (2003) study. The sample will include patients having out patient surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical procedure will vary from general surgical procedures, ENT procedures, and gynecology procedures. Patients will be asked to consent to the survey before having surgery, monitored in recovery, and will be asked to fill out a survey in ambulatory surgery before leaving for home. The American Pain Society questionnaire was used to measure patient satisfaction with pain management. (Chung, 2003) The findings will provide information about how to increase post-operative pain relief in surgical patients. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Hypertonus of {{masseter}} {{and chest}} wall muscle in one patient following intravenous suxamethonium is reported. Subsequent investigations including electromyography and muscle biopsy with in vitro pharmacological testing failed to reveal any abnormality {{to account for}} the response. The clinical problems presented to the anaesthetist when suxamethonium-induced hypertonus occurs are discussed. The relationship between a hypertonic reaction to suxamethonium and neuromuscular disease (including myotonic disorders and the malignant hyperpyrexia myopathy) is considered. Muscle hypertonus following i. v. suxamethonium is a rare and unexpected phenomenon. This abnormal reaction to suxamethonium presents the anaesthetist with the initial problems of securing an airway and maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation as tris-mus and <b>respiratory</b> muscle <b>spasm</b> may jeopardize the patient's life. Also, there is the possibility that the reaction is the first clinical manifestation of malignant hyperpyrexia, the mortality of which is greater than 60 % (Britt and Kalow, 1970). Failure of skeletal muscle to relax after suxamethonium is considered by many to justify terminating the anaesthetic (Cody, 1968; Arens and McKinnon, 1971; Ryan, 1973 a). Thus the development of an abnormal reac-tion to suxamethonium merits subsequent investiga-tion to elucidate a cause for the response. Hypertonus following suxamethonium may occur in patients with myotonic disorders (Kaufman, 1960; Paterson, 1962; Thiel, 1967; Cody, 1968), and it is known to occur in patients with other neuromuscular disorders including the malignant hyperpyrexia myopathy. CASE REPORT A 26 -year-old Negro woman was admitted to the Birmingham Maternity Hospital with a history of spontaneous rupture of the membranes at a gestational age of 29 weeks. Despite rest and sedation, she went into labour and proceeded rapidly to the normal vaginal delivery of a 1. 3 -kg baby girl. The placenta was retained and the duty anaesthetist was asked to provide anaesthesia for its removal.

40|$|Background: Transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) in {{the cardiac}} lab is usually performed in pediatric patients under general anesthesia with an endotracheal intubation (ET). This study {{was performed to}} investigate the safety and efficacy of using the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) {{as an alternative to}} ET to maintain pediatric airway during the general anesthesia for TEE. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 pediatric patients undergoing TEE in the cardiac lab were randomized to have their airway maintained during the procedure with either LMA (LMA group) or ET (ET group). Hemodynamic, respiratory parameters, time to extubation, recovery time, the incidence of complication and operator satisfaction were compared between the two groups. Results: There were no differences between both groups in hemodynamic and <b>respiratory</b> parameters. Laryngeal <b>spasm</b> was reported in one patient in the LMA group and two patients in the ET group. TEE operators were equally satisfied with the procedure in groups. The time to extubation was shorter in the LMA group (P < 0. 01). The mean recovery time was also significantly shorter in the LMA than in the ET group (44 ± 8 min and 59 ± 11 min, respectively; P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The LMA is safe and effective in securing the airway of children undergoing diagnostic TEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the correlation between dental caries and the black stain, both in deciduous and mixed dentition. 							A cross-sectional study was practiced to determine the prevalence of chromogenic bacteria in the mouth, and their relationship with teeth pigmentation and caries index. 							A total of 433 children aged between 3 and 10 years old were examined at the Servicio de Diagnóstico de la Facultad de Odontología de Rosario. The Study group comprised 18 children with black stain while the Control group comprised 18 stain-free children. Dental plaque and saliva samples were taken from both groups and black stain samples were taken from the Study group. All the samples were cultured in specific media for anaerobic pigment-forming bacteria. Variables were established and the data from clinical and dental history, and bacteriologic results was statistically analyzed. 							The examined population had no obvious evidence of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMF-T= 0); however, they suffered from some <b>respiratory</b> disease (bronchial <b>spasm,</b> retropharyngeal mucus and otitis, oral habits like fingersucking, onychophagia and mouth breathing).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEarly {{childhood}} {{is characterized by}} dramatic gains in emotion regulation skills that support social adjustment and mental health. Understanding the physiological substrates of healthy emotion regulation may offer new directions for altering trajectories toward initiation and escalation of substance abuse. Here, we describe the intersections between parasympathetic and sympathetic tone, emotion regulation and prosocial behavior in a high-risk sample of preschoolers. MethodFifty-two 3 – 6 year old children completed an assessment of attention regulation in response to <b>affective</b> stimuli. Cardiac <b>respiratory</b> sinus arrhythmia, an index of parasympathetic tone, and pre-ejection period, a marker of sympathetic activation, were recorded at rest and while children engaged in social interactions with their mothers and an unfamiliar research assistant. Mothers reported on children’s emotional reactivity and prosocial behavior. ResultsControlling for age and psychosocial risk, higher parasympathetic tone predicted better attention regulation in response to angry emotion {{and higher levels of}} prosocial behavior, whereas a reciprocal pattern of higher parasympathetic tone and lower sympathetic arousal predicted better attention in response to positive emotion and lower emotional reactivity. Children exposed to fewer risk factors and higher levels of maternal warmth were more able to sustain a high level of parasympathetic tone during interaction episodes. ConclusionsFindings suggest that autonomic measures represent biomarkers for socio-emotional competence in young children. They also point to the importance of early experiences in the establishment of physiological regulation and the promise of family-based intervention to promote healthy emotion regulation and prevent substance dependence in high-risk populations...|$|R
40|$|Background : Human body is very {{sensitive}} to electricity. Electrical exposure without any protector can cause injury, even death. Almost all of the death caused by electricity which happened in waters, neither electrical marks nor burns resulted in the macroscopic finding. The passage of a current across the chest may lead to <b>respiratory</b> paralysis from <b>spasm</b> of the intercostals muscles. Electrothermal injury of musculature may manifest as hyperaemia, rupture, and tissue necrosis. The primary determinant of damage caused by direct effects of electricity {{is the amount of}} current flowing through the body (amperage). This research had a purpose to know the correlation between the low tension alternating current electrical exposure with different amperage to intercostals muscles histopathology characteristic of Wistar rats. Method : An experimental study using control group with post test only control group design to Wistar rats which was given an alternating current electrical exposure. The samples which consist of 15 Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups. They were one control group, received standard diet and two treatment group, which was given an alternating current electrical exposure with 50 mA for the first treatment group (P 1), and 100 mA for the second treatment group (P 2). This electrical exposure was given for 10 seconds. After observating, intercostals muscles were immediately taken from the rats and made a preparat. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis method for between subject data. The statistical analysis was done with SPSS program for windows 15. 00. The difference is significant when p< 0, 05. Result : The results of the study shows that third group had the highest mean of hyperaemia as 0, 94 + 0, 38471; the first group had mean of hyperaemia as 0; the second group had mean of hyperaemia as 0, 34 + 0, 20736. The Mann-Whitney test showed that {{there was a significant difference}} (p< 0, 05) among all of groups and hyperaemia finding. The significant difference between first group and second group is p= 0, 018, first group and third group is p= 0, 005, and second group and third group is p= 0, 036. Conclusion : The alternating current electrical exposure with 50 mA dan 100 mA for 10 seconds caused significant intercostals muscles damage of Wistar rats, which manifest as hyperaemia. The higher the amperage was given would more increase the hyperaemia of muscle level. Keyword :Amperage, Intercostals muscles,Hiperaemi. ...|$|R
