25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, an English publisher, Gordon Landsborough, {{attempted}} {{to produce a}} film version {{of the book and}} wrote a film treatment for it. When he discovered that MGM still held the film rights he attempted to buy them but was unsuccessful as MGM announced their interest in filming it, using a script by Carl Foreman. Landsborough wrote in 1965 of rumours of political pressure holding up that new MGM production. <b>Another</b> <b>movie</b> version was mentioned in the 1967 sales film Lionpower from MGM, as being slated for production in 1968–1969 but nothing came of this version either.|$|E

25|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote:...you have {{to wonder}} who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and asks us to pity a death-camp guard. You {{could argue that the}} film isn’t really about the Holocaust, but about the {{generation}} that grew up in its shadow, which is what the book insists. But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it's about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.|$|E
25|$|Black Jack, 1973–83. The {{story of}} Black Jack, a talented surgeon who {{operates}} illegally, using radical and supernatural techniques to combat rare afflictions. Black Jack received the Japan Cartoonists' Association Special Award in 1975 and the Koudansha Manga Award in 1977. Three Black Jack TV movies were released between 2000-01. In fall 2004, an anime television series was aired in Japan with 61 episodes, releasing <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> afterward. A new series, titled Black Jack 21, started broadcasting on April 10, 2006. In September 2008, {{the first volume}} of the manga had been published in English by Vertical Publishing and more volumes are being published to this day.|$|E
25|$|Both {{films were}} box office failures, and Dreyer {{did not make}} <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> until 1943. Denmark was by now under Nazi occupation, and his Day of Wrath had as its theme the {{paranoia}} surrounding witch hunts {{in the seventeenth century}} in a strongly theocratic culture. With this work, Dreyer established the style that would mark his sound films: careful compositions, stark monochrome cinematography, and very long takes. In the more than a decade before his next full-length feature film, Dreyer made two documentaries. In 1955, he made Ordet (The Word) based on the play of the same name by Kaj Munk. The film combines a love story with a conflict of faith. Dreyer's last film was 1964's Gertrud. Although seen by some as a lesser film than its predecessors, it is a fitting close to Dreyer's career, as it deals with a woman who, through the tribulations of her life, never expresses regret for her choices.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Wu {{became a}} {{director}} {{in his own}} right. His directorial debut, Wrath of the Sword, was released the same year. In 1971, Wu released one of his seminial works, The Deaf And Mute Heroine. He concentrated on directing in the 1970s, directing several movies – such as Young Tiger (1973) and Wits To Wits (1974). Wits To Wits has been noted {{as one of the}} precursors of the knockabout comedy kung fu genre that was later made famous by Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan. <b>Another</b> <b>movie</b> Wu directed, Manchu Boxer (1974), featured Sammo Hung, then a young choreographer and later one of the trend-setters of Hong Kong cinema. This marked the beginning of a strong working relationship between the two, which would become prominent towards the 1980s. He co-directed with his former mentor Chang in several movies – The Water Margin (1972), The Pirate (1973), All Men Are Brothers (1975) and The Naval Commandos (1976).|$|E
25|$|Yorktown {{arrived back}} in Long Beach on 5 July {{and entered the}} Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She {{completed}} repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of <b>another</b> <b>movie,</b> Tora! Tora! Tora! which recreated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In December 1968, she served {{as one of the}} recovery ships for the Apollo 8 space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port—Norfolk, Virginia—on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the West Indies until late summer. On 2 September, Yorktown departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise Operation Peacekeeper. During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and Yorktown began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to Brest, France, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Yorktown put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises from 18 October – 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at Kiel, Germany. After that, she stopped at Copenhagen, Denmark, and at Portsmouth, England, before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.|$|E

500|$|Missouri {{was central}} to {{the plot of the}} film Under Siege, and the ship was {{prominently}} featured in <b>another</b> <b>movie,</b> Battleship. As Missouri has not moved under her own power since 1992, shots of the ship at sea were obtained with the help of three tugboats. The music video for Cher's If I Could Turn Back Time was also filmed aboard the Missouri. The U.S. Navy, which had granted permission to shoot the video there, was unhappy with the sexual nature of the performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic.

Some day, though, I'd like to make <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> that kids could go and see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E

Yaphet Kotto was cast while doing <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> for United Artists, Across 110th Street.

500|$|In 1968, Colonel Parker {{arranged}} {{a deal with}} NBC for a Christmas television special starring Presley {{in front of a}} live audience. Parker originally planned to have Presley sing Christmas carols only, but producer Steve Binder convinced the singer to perform songs from his original repertoire. The high ratings received by the special and the success of its attendant LP re-established Presley's popularity. During the making of the special, Presley said to Binder: [...] "I'll never sing another song that I don't believe in, I'm never going to make <b>another</b> <b>movie</b> that I don't believe in." [...] As part of his decision to refocus on music rather than film, Presley decided to record a new album.|$|E
