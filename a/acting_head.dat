5|$|Bernard Lee died in January 1981, after filming {{had started}} on For Your Eyes Only, {{but before he}} could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had done in the {{previous}} eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{recruits}} to Manhattan Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory, arriving in March 1943. He became <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of the Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) Division. There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy, as he was only 26 years old at the time. An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to co-ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he did not wish to move to New Mexico. Despite his youth, Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein Kamel took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him on an equal footing with the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish Estonian independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's highest authority and on 18 September 1944, <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over the radio in English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but {{did not have time}} to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The Estonian Government in Exile served to carry the continuity of the Estonian state forward until 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong first taught {{phonetics}} in 1917 in Daniel Jones's summer {{course for}} missionaries; even before then, Jones {{had planned to}} give Armstrong a full-time position at the University College Phonetics Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and reader in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review.

5|$|The red {{and gold}} striped ombrellino or {{pavilion}} was originally a processional canopy or sunshade {{and can be found}} so depicted as early as the 12th century. The earliest use of the ombrellino in heraldry is in the 1420s when it was placed above the shield of Pope Martin V. It is more commonly used together with the keys, a combination first found under Pope Alexander VI. This combined badge represents the temporal power of Vatican City between Papal reigns, when the <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of state is the cardinal Camerlengo. The badge first appeared with a cardinal's personal arms on coins minted by order of the Camerlengo, Cardinal Armellini, during the inter-regnum of 1521. During the 17th and 18th centuries, it appeared on coins minted sede vacante by papal legates, and on coins minted in 1746 and 1771 while a pope reigned. The ombrellino appears in the arms of basilicas since the 16th century, with ornamentation for major basilicas. If found in a family's coat of arms, it indicates that a relative had been pope.|$|E

As a result of negative publicity regarding its airplanes in Mexico, Mitchell and the Aviation Section came under severe criticism during this period. Mitchell defended the department, insisting that the U.S. firms did not produce better aircraft, but the outcry produced several long-term results, including instructing Mitchell in political tactics, participation in which ultimately resulted in his court-martial {{at the end of}} his career.|$|R
5|$|The Guatemalan {{authorities}} {{were unaware of}} ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In {{the second half of}} 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became <b>acting</b> <b>head</b> of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén.|$|E
