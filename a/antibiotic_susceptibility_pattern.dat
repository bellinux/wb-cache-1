40|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} one of the {{important}} agents in the creation of gallstones in the gallbladder. In recent years the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) is increasing and of concern in hospitalized patients worldwide. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns</b> of isolated bacteria from the bile specimens of patients with chronic and acute cholecystitis who had been operated by single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in Isfahan (Iran) using an antibiogram susceptibility test and molecular technique. The bile fluids of 91 patients were obtained from the Al-Zahra hospital and were cultured on specific media for the isolation of Gram-negative and positive bacteria and the disk diffusion test was done to determine the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns</b> of isolated bacteria. Finally, bacterial DNA was extracted from the bile samples and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to investigate extended-spectrum beta-lactamases genes. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in bile specimens cultured with high frequency, and the results showed that biliary infection increased with aging in patients with gallstone disease operated by SILC. The results showed a high frequency of ESBL genes including TEM, SHV, and CTX-M in isolated bacteria (especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.). Thus, evaluating the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns</b> and screening of ESBLs bacteria in patients with gallstones are essential.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of nosocomial infections. Resistance to various antibiotics, such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides {{is one of the}} major problems in treatment and prevention of infections caused by this bacterium. Therefore, accurate determination of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>pattern</b> of organisms isolated from patients can be beneficial in treatment and prevention of dangerous infections. The objective of this study was to isolate S. aureus bacterium and to determine the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>pattern</b> of the isolated strains in patients referred to some treatment centers of Qom city. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 340 clinical samples, were collected from September 2016 to July 2017. After isolation and primary identification of S. aureus isolates (using standard bacteriology methods), the isolated strains were confirmed by PCR technique and amplification of femA gene as a molecular diagnostic marker of S. aureus. Finally, <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>pattern</b> of the strains, was determined by disk diffusion method according to CLSI guideline. Results: Out of 340 clinical samples, 86 S. aureus strains were isolated and identified based on phenotypic characteristics. The femA gene was observed only in 45 strains (52. 32 %) based on molecular analysis. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility test showed that the highest resistance was to penicillin (86. 04 %) and the lowest resistance was to chloramphenicol (0 %). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that femA gene cannot by itself identify all the S. aureus strains. Also, with regard to the results of antibiogram test, it seems that antibiotic susceptibility test is necessary for S. aureus strains isolated from patients...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human pathogens. A major clinical concern is the high rate of antibiotic resistance among Staphylococcus aureus strains. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are a major cause of community- and hospital-acquired infections. Therefore, genetic investigation of S. aureus strains isolated from patients with staphylococcal infection is crucial not only for tracking of infections but also for nosocomial infection control. Materials and Methods In this study, 103 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected from Tehran University of Medical Sciences hospitals. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns</b> of the isolates were determined using a panel of 13 antibiotics by the disk-diffusion method. The isolates were investigated for hvr by the PCR method. Results: According to the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> testing, 21 antibiotype profiles were detected. Sixty-four out of the 103 isolates were resistant to methicillin. PCR results showed 10 different patterns of hvr. Conclusion: The results of this study showed high rates of antibiotic resistance and variations of hvr among the Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The high degree of hvr variation can be a good tool to use for molecular typing of this bacterial strain. Further investigation of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns</b> and genetic features of this bacterium is highly recommended for controlling community- and hospital- acquired infections...|$|R

The epidemic peaked during the winter, included the simultaneous transmission of the disease from person to person and from common food sources, and especially affected inhabitants of the poor, inner-city neighborhoods, young children of both sexes, and women. Resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, encoded in a 70 -MDa plasmid, was found in most of the examined isolates. Unexpectedly, isolates from patients involved in a food-borne outbreak exhibited three different <b>antibiotic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>patterns,</b> suggesting deletion of antibiotic resistance determinants in some strains. Antibiograms clearly separated food-borne outbreak-related and non-foodborne outbreak-related strains, distinguished more strains than did the plasmid profiles, and were useful in tracing the dissemination of individual isolates in the community.
