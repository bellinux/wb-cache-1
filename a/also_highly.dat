5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> {{correlated with the}} presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Captain Walter Lux, 53, {{had been}} flying the DC-10 since its {{introduction}} eight years earlier. He had logged around 22,000 flying hours, of which about 3,000 {{were in a}} DC-10. He was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft, including the DC-6, DC-7, and Boeing 727. First Officer James Dillard, 49, and Flight Engineer Alfred Udovich, 56, were <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours respectively, and between them they had 1,830 hours flying experience in the DC-10.|$|E

5|$|In the Giro di Lombardia, Astana's final {{race of the}} season, {{they were}} more {{successful}} {{than they had been}} most of the season, attaining a fourth podium finish in a one-day race on the year. While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event, Brajkovič won a sprint over 's Rigoberto Urán for second, and reacted as though he won the race. Chris Horner was <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> placed in the event, finishing seventh.|$|E
5|$|Japan's small {{agricultural}} sector, however, is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> subsidized and protected, {{with government}} regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There {{has been a}} growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.|$|E
5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E

5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{radioactive}} actinide metal whose isotope, plutonium-239, {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two); plutonium-241 is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Sport {{fishing is}} also popular on the Klamath River, with steelhead trout {{being the most}} popular, though Chinook salmon are <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> sought after when low salmon returns do not prevent fishing.

5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> gregarious when not nesting.|$|E
5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
5|$|The {{most highly}} ranked general {{journals}} which publish original {{research in the}} field of sociology are the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review.

5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|France in the 12th {{century was}} a loose {{collection}} of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal {{control of the}} king of France. The king's power was linked to his control of the rich province of Île-de-France, just {{to the east of}} Stephen's home county of Blois. In the west lay the three counties of Maine, Anjou and Touraine, and to the north of Blois was the Duchy of Normandy, from which William the Conqueror had conquered England in 1066. William's children were still fighting over the collective Anglo-Norman inheritance. The rulers across this region spoke a similar language, albeit with regional dialects, followed the same religion, and were closely interrelated; they were <b>also</b> <b>highly</b> competitive and frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory and the castles that controlled them.|$|E
