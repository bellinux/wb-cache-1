40|$|Background. Klebsiella oxytoca was {{recently}} {{shown to be}} the causative agent of <b>antibiotic-associated</b> hemor-rhagic <b>colitis.</b> Because {{it is unclear whether}} K. oxytoca also causes nonhemorrhagic antibiotic-associated diarrhea, our study investigated a possible association between K. oxytoca and that disorder. Methods. A total of 371 consecutive patients were recruited into 4 study groups: (1) group A+D+ (patients who received antibiotics and experienced diarrhea;), (2) group A+D (patients who received antibioticsnp 107 but did not experience diarrhea;), (3) group AD+ (patients who experienced acute-onset diarrhea butnp 93 did not receive antibiotics;), and (4) group AD (patients without diarrhea who did not receive antibiotics;np 60). Stool samples were plated on MacConkey agar and K. oxytoca was identified using a standard test kit. np 111 Clostridium difficile was detected by a toxin A/B antigen test. K. oxytoca strains were tested for cytotoxicity with use of cell-culture assays. Results. In 15 of 371 stool samples, K. oxytoca strains were isolated during the study period. There {{was no significant difference in}} the distribution of K. oxytoca among the 4 study groups. Six of the 15 strains were found to be toxin producing.

40|$|We {{examined}} the enterotoxicity of a Klebsiella oxytoca cytotoxin which {{is produced by}} K. oxytoca OK- 1, a strain from a patient with <b>antibiotic-associated</b> hemorrhagic <b>colitis.</b> Injection of the cytotoxin into ligated ileal and colonic loops in rabbits caused the accumulation of fluid in the loops. The fluid was bloody in the ileal loops {{but not in the}} colonic ones. Histological examination revealed intense mucosal hemorrhage with erosion in the ileum, whereas no microscopic change was noted in the colon. The fluid accumulation was shown to be a dose-dependent response in both ileal and colonic loops. The amounts of the cytotoxin required for maximal fluid accumulation in ileal and colonic loops were 60 and 10 micrograms, respectively. Fluid accumulation was first noticeable in ileal loops 12 h and in colonic ones 5 h after the injection of these doses of the cytotoxin and then proceeded with time. When K. oxytoca OK- 1, a cytotoxin-producing strain, was inoculated into the loops at doses of 1 x 10 (8) and 5 x 10 (9) CFU, similar fluid accumulation was observed. However, inoculation of K. oxytoca ATCC 13182, a non-cytotoxin-producing strain, at the same doses did not cause any change.

40|$|Background. Clostridium difficile is {{currently}} {{the leading cause of}} infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. In addition to the infection due to toxigenic C. difficile in the gastrointestinal tract of susceptible hosts, other predisposing factors for C. difficile infection (CDI) are identified, including advanced age, a prolonged hospital stay, and use of acid-suppressive drugs. Of note, exposure to gastric acid-reducing agents, such as H 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), remains a controversial risk factor, and has been associated with CDI in some studies but not in others. A mouse model of <b>antibiotic-associated</b> clostridial <b>colitis</b> was established to examine the role of PPIs for CDI. Materials andMethods. Amouse model of <b>antibiotic-associated</b> clostridial <b>colitis</b> was set up. NF-κB reporter mice were used to address the in vivo spatial and temporal inflammatory patterns of C. difficile–associated colitis. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide and dextran-FITC were measured to reflect the barrier permeability of affected intestines. Results. Mice with CDI that were exposed to PPI exhibited greater losses of stool consistency and body and cecal weights than those that were not exposed to PPI. Further, more neutrophilic infiltrations, epithelial damage, and in-flammatory cytokine expression were noted in colon specimens of the mice with PPI exposure. More-evident inflam-matory responses were detected by in vivo imaging of NF-κB reporter mice with CDI that were exposed to PPI.

40|$|Clostridium dtfficile is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of <b>antibiotic-associated</b> <b>colitis,</b> but its epidemiology remains unknown. Using a selective medium for the isolation of C. dif-ficile, cultures were obtained from the environment and contacts of hospitalized pa-tients carrying C. difficile in their stools. In areas where carriers had diarrhea, 85 (9. 30, 70) of 910 cultures of floors and other surfaces, especially those subject to fecal contamina-tion, were positive. In areas where there were no known carriers, only 13 (2. 60, 70) of 497 cultures of similar sites were positive (P < 0. 005). C. difficile was isolated from hands and stools of asymptomatic hospital personnel, from sewage and soil, and from the home of a patient. Environmental isolates were toxigenic.

30|$|Although it {{was already}} {{described}} in 1982 that K. oxytoca produces the pyrrolobenzodiazepine cytotoxin tilivalline (Mohr and Budzikiewicz 1982), only recently a direct link between tilivalline and <b>antibiotic-associated</b> haemorrhagic <b>colitis</b> has been described (Schneditz et al. 2014). In our study, tilivalline significantly inhibited the wound healing capacity of TR 146 epithelial cells. However, no differences in the effects on wound healing were observed between the K. oxytoca tilivalline mutant strain, the wild type and the complementation strain. This suggests that its concentration present in the co-culture medium is probably too low to exert any effect and thus excludes this molecule from being responsible for K. oxytoca’s inhibitory effect on wound healing in our model.|$|R
30|$|Clostridium difficile spp. {{are among}} the most {{difficult}} microorganisms to eradicate in the environment [31]. Its' spores cannot be destroyed by antiseptics, such as alcohol, so hand washing with water and soap is essential.

The incidence is rather low although rising, and several outbreaks have been described [31]. Due to a reduced susceptibility to metronidazole, antibiotic treatment also becomes more difficult [33]. Most important risk factors for Clostridium-associated diarrhoea antimicrobial therapy, older age (> 65 years), antineoplastic chemotherapy, and length of hospital stay [32]. Other interventions with high-risk associations are enemas, nasogastric tubes, gastrointestinal surgery, and antiperistaltic drugs [32].|$|R

40|$|AbstractToxins A and B {{from the}} {{anaerobic}} bacterium Clostridium difficile are the causative {{agents of the}} <b>antibiotic-associated</b> pseudomembraneous <b>colitis.</b> At the subcellular level, they inhibit the Rho family GTPases, thus causing alterations of the actin cytoskeleton.

Our results indicate that both toxins induce oxidative stress with a significant depletion of protein SH-groups. These responses and the cytoskeleton-dependent cell retraction and rounding are significantly counteracted by N-acetylcysteine but not by α-tocopherol.

Eighteen dogs with strangulation obstruction were studied. Closed midjejunal loops were constructed and bowel continuity was reestablished by end-to-end anastomosis. Venous blood supply to the closed loop was divided and ligated. Twelve dogs were sacrificed 18 hr later when specimens of blood, loop fluid, and bowel wall were obtained for cultures; the remaining animals were sacrificed at 3 hr and served as operative controls. Half of the dogs received 1 g of vancomycin 1 day before and 1 hr before operation. Clostridia were isolated from the loop fluids in all but four of nine dogs that had received vancomycin. Bacteria-free loop fluids injected intracecally into hamsters caused diarrhea and colitis as did bacteria-free filtrates of Clostridium sordellii broth cultures isolated from the dogs. The animals pretreated with vancomycin showed ischemic changes in their obstructed bowel loops but their loop fluid was not toxic to hamsters.
