50|$|Prior to {{introduction}} of the TAP card, a magnetic stripe card called the Metrocard (not {{to be confused with}} the New York Metropolitan Transportation <b>Authority's</b> <b>card)</b> was introduced in 1993 on Culver CityBus, with later expansion to Foothill Transit, Montebello Bus Lines, Norwalk Transit, and Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. The fare card only offered stored value, and was compatible with GFI Genfare fareboxes used by these systems. The program was dubbed the Universal Fare System, or UFS, for future implementation throughout Los Angeles County. Later innovations expanded the magnetic stripe technology for monthly and day passes.|$|R

50|$|Tipping (dricks) is {{commonly}} not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or {{as a kind}} gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill. This is mostly done at restaurants (less often if payment is made at the desk) and in taxis (some taxis are very expensive {{as there is no}} fixed tariff, so they might not be tipped). Less often hairdressers are tipped. Tips are taxed in Sweden, but cash tips are not much declared to the tax <b>authority.</b> <b>Cards</b> are heavily used in Sweden as of the 2010s, and tips paid by cards in restaurants are regularly checked by the tax authority. There are reports that restaurant owners keep card tips and that waitresses do not notice generous card tips.|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the efforts for incorporating non-Roman scripts, notably Arabic, in MARC bibliographic and authority records. Arabic name authority records have been handwritten using Arabic script and filed manually in book or card catalogs since {{the time that it}} was considered important to preserve this information. After the adoption of typewriters as tools in library cataloging departments, those who only had Latin script typewriters were forced into using transliteration schemes, a practice that has been criticized for compromising uniformity and accessibility. (Houissa) Later, typewriters fitted with Arabic character keys allowed <b>authority</b> <b>cards</b> to be typed in Arabic. There were also attempts to encode both Latin and Arabic scripts on cards—or in book catalogs, as the first dual-script name authorities; something that was encouraged by the catalog cards distributed between 1902 and 1997 by the Library of Congress...|$|R

50|$|The {{secondary}} migrants {{moved to}} Pakistan {{with the ultimate}} aim of emigrating to North America, Europe and Australia. As of mid-2012, most of the former were legally registered with the UNHCR in Islamabad. The agency offered skills-training programs in English, primary education courses, as well as provisions to cover basic amenities and living expenses. Members of the community sought {{to improve the quality}} and consistency of these services by raising their concerns with the relevant authorities. Additionally, the UNHCR issued Proof of Registration (POR) Cards to the secondary migrants in conjunction with NADRA. Others wielded a National Aliens Registration <b>Authority</b> (NARA) <b>Card.</b> A section of the younger generation among this group {{was born and raised in}} Pakistan.

50|$|CONWIP {{is a kind}} of {{single-stage}} kanban {{system and}} is also a hybrid push-pull system. While Kanban systems maintain tighter control of system WIP through the individual cards at each workstation, CONWIP systems are easier to implement and adjust, since only one set of system cards is used to manage system WIP. CONWIP uses cards to control the number of WIPs. For example, no part is allowed to enter the system without a <b>card</b> (<b>authority).</b> After a finished part is completed at the last workstation, a card is transferred to the first workstation and a new part is pushed into the sequential process route. In their paper, Spearman et al. (1990) used a simulation to make a comparison among the CONWIP, kanban and push systems, and found that CONWIP systems can achieve a lower WIP level than kanban systems.|$|R
40|$|Prepaid {{and other}} stored-value {{products}} have grown into major tools for making retail payments and payments of wages to employees. This article discusses two major developments in {{federal law that}} pertain to stored-value products - the November 2008 - revision of primary guidance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the scope of eligibility of payroll cards for deposit insurance, and Congress’ May, 2009 enactment of the CARD Act, which takes effect on February 22, 2010. The CARD Act is the first effort {{by the federal government}} to regulate gift cards. It established federal standards relating to subjects on which state laws varied widely, and preempts state laws. In addition, the CARD Act gave to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System rule making <b>authority</b> over gift <b>cards,</b> general-use prepaid cards, and electronic gift certificates. The Act also grants to the Department of the Treasury authority to adopt comprehensive regulations concerning the issuance, sale, redemption and international transport of stored-value <b>cards.</b> This <b>authority</b> reflects growing concerns that money launderers are increasingly able to move funds through stored-value products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Having no trusted user interface, {{smart cards}} {{are unable to}} {{communicate}} with the user directly. Communication is possible {{with the aid of a}} terminal only, which leads to several security problems. For example, if the terminal is untrusted (which is a very typical scenario), it may perform a man-in-the middle attack. Thus, a malicious terminal can make the user sign documents that she would not sign otherwise. A signature that a card computes at a malicious terminal does not prove anything about the content of the signed document. What it does prove, is that the user did insert her card into a malicious terminal and she did intend to sign – something. In this paper we propose a solution where a user has multiple smart cards, and each card represents a ’signal’, a certain piece of information. The user encodes her message by using a subset of her cards for signing at the untrusted terminal. The recipient decodes the message by checking which cards were used. We also make use of time stamps from a trusted time stamping <b>authority</b> to allow <b>cards</b> to be used more than once. ...|$|R

He reads in a library about the Othertimer's time-science. A theory is given of multiple timelines; these do not seem to split off from different outcomes, like quantum realities, but simply proceed separately. However, they can be controlled, and contact between them can be made. References are made to the changeling myth. The law is stated that [...] "Any two time-lines approximate to the exact degree to which their material contents are alike," [...] and it is revealed that an experiment with a replica railway shed in the right place had already been successful in allowing a controlled transfer of minds. The text ends with Scudamour still reading.|$|R
