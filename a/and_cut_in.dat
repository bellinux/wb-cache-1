5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
25|$|This ident was altered {{slightly}} on 1 September 1989 following the TVS management restructuring, {{so that the}} ident was against a gradient blue background <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> to {{the rotation of the}} logo into the lettering. The caption was changed to 'Television' to reflect the stations technical name of TVS Television, and the music was altered slightly to be bolder. Against the blue background, the metallic lettering now has the appearance of glass or perspex. This ident was used by TVS until they went off air on 31 December 1992, when a special ident with the caption 'Thanks for Watching' was used to close the final TVS programme.|$|E
25|$|T. H. Foley {{made the}} first medals from 1912 until they went out of {{business}} in 1915. The eagle pendant and scroll were of die struck bronze washed with silver. Early versions were made with a short double knot and later ones with a long double knot. Only 338 of these medals were issued, making them the rarest version. Some Foleys were issued with a drop ribbon– the ribbon was extended, folded through the bar mount on the scroll, then dropped behind the eagle pendant <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> a swallowtail. The first drop ribbon style medal was issued to the fourth Eagle Scout– Sidney Clapp, a 31-year-old Scoutmaster from West Shokan, NY.|$|E

500|$|The North American DVD {{release was}} on 8 August 2005. A Blu-ray {{version of the}} DVD was {{released}} on 12 December 2006 by Sony Pictures. A UMD version of the film was released for the PlayStation Portable. The United States DVD releases was censored <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> a number of scenes that featured {{a lot of blood}} or human excrement, a later release, called [...] "The Kick-Axe Edition" [...] saw these edits removed.|$|E
500|$|In the 1963 session, [...] "That's What My Heart Needs" [...] and [...] "Mary's Little Lamb" [...] were {{recorded}} <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> June 1963; the latter {{became one of}} the worst-selling singles by Redding. Rob Bowman, in his book Soulsville, U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records, wrote that in these two songs [...] "Otis sings with a harsh, impassioned gospel voice reminiscent of Archie Brownlee of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi" [...] and further reckoned the ending of the first would have made Redding [...] "a suberb gospel singer had he chosen to record in that idiom." [...] "That's What My Heart Needs" [...] became Redding's second single on Stax.|$|E
500|$|The visual for [...] "Neonlight Lipstick" [...] is {{loosely based}} on the 1812 fairy tale Snow White, and {{features}} Amuro wearing a red dress while being present in a forest. For several shots, she is presented in a black cloak accompanied by backup dancers; interspersed scenes show Amuro dancing {{on top of a}} book, with computer generated imagery and the background performers surrounding her. Prior to the clip's release, a preview was premiered on YouTube on November 25, 2013. [...] "Ballerina"'s clip acted as a collaboration with Gucci and Vogue Japan; it featured Amuro wearing clothing designed by Gucci, and being surrounded by several special effects inside a small mansion-esque structure. Throughout the video, there are lopped scenes of Amuro walking, with these being edited <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> several ways. Scenes of Amuro sitting on a vast field of digitised grass are also presented, with jellyfish floating and other effects. Like the previous visual, [...] "Ballerina" [...] was accompanied by a teaser which was released on the same day on social media.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that Jordi Mollà {{was included in the}} cast and the names of several supporting characters. However, Mollà subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a James Bond film, where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Mollà's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost [...] "like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn’t just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts , which as a standalone thing was really cool." [...] Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as film editors. In March 2015, Hayley Atwell confirmed that she would reprise her role as Peggy Carter in the film. In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing [...] "a little bit of additional" [...] filming.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disruption}} {{has been}} felt on a practical level: [...] "They were expecting {{to have the}} score tightened <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Beijing, with the Western-style orchestra, before resetting it for the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra," [...] said a source involved in the production, referring to the ensemble of native Chinese instruments that will accompany the Hong Kong premiere. [...] "Instead, we must adapt the score to the new timbre and make cuts at the same time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "mixed farming" [...] better {{applies to}} {{southern}} Alberta agricultural practices during 1881-1914 than does [...] "ranching." [...] "Pure ranching" [...] involves cowboys working predominantly from horseback; {{it was the}} norm when huge ranches were formed in 1881. Quickly practices were modified. Hay was planted <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> summer to provide winter cattle feed; fences were built and repaired to contain winter herds; and dairy cows and barnyard animals were maintained for personal consumption and secondarily for market. Mixed farming was clearly predominant in southern Alberta by 1900.|$|E

The mixture is so thick that a spoon inserted into the custard does not fall if the cup is inverted. [...] It is also widely noted among natives of St. Louis that a standard first question among adults of any age in the St. Louis metro area is [...] "where {{did you go to}} High School?" [...] due to the large number of private and prestigious high schools.|$|E
2500|$|Edward's forces met little resistance, sacking {{numerous}} settlements, {{until they}} reached the Loire River at Tours. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed King John II to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging Breteuil in Normandy, organised the bulk of his army at Chartres to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux. The French rode hard <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. [...] Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south. [...] Historians disagree over whether the outnumbered English commander was seeking battle or trying to avoid it. [...] In any case, after preliminary maneuvers and failed negotiations for a truce, the two armies faced off, both ready for battle, near Poitiers on Monday, 19 September 1356.|$|E
