5|$|Michael {{discovers that}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) has artificially inseminated herself from a sperm bank when Kevin runs into her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store.

5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{products}} are constantly {{in need of}} refrigeration, {{and it was only}} discovered {{in the past few decades}} that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.|$|E
25|$|On October 2, 2014, Groupon {{unveiled}} Snap, a new app {{specifically for}} giving customers cash {{back when they}} buy certain items <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store. Snap asks shoppers to upload photos of their receipts after they've gone to the supermarket to buy groceries. Certain items are then eligible for discounts, which shoppers receive {{in the form of}} a cash-back deal. The new app comes from Groupon's previous acquisition of SnapSaves, a Canadian start-up that works much like Snap.|$|E
