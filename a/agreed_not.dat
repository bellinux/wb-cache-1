As Trollope had <b>agreed</b> <b>not</b> to allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Gladstone {{returned}} to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old.

5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta <b>agreed</b> <b>not</b> to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the Taylor administration's {{definitive}} accomplishment {{in foreign}} policy was the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, {{and the construction of}} such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position. For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations <b>agreed</b> <b>not</b> to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E
