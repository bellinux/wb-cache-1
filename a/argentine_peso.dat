5|$|The ensuing {{economic}} and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country's independence. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998. Over {{the course of two}} years, output fell by more than 15%, the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.|$|E
5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected of corruption in 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this request was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks to pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso.</b> It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, after Mexico had {{announced}} {{its inability to}} service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for ﬁnancial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness, and the program failed. With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.|$|E

5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso,</b> which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} this may be {{compared}} to the neighboring Brazilian real, which was roughly {{on a par with the}} <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> until the beginning of 2003, when both currencies were about three per U.S. dollar. The real started gaining in value more than the peso due to Brazil's slower buildup of dollar reserves; by December 29, 2009 a real was worth almost 2.2 pesos.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{there was}} a period of hyperinflation, running at up to 12,000% per year in 1989. Foreign {{investment}} was mostly stagnant. Under the presidency of Carlos Menem, the country saw some economic stability. The favorable exchange rate on the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> during the convertibility period saw an influx of foreign investment. However this period also saw a dramatic drop in domestic consumption.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to the 2001 economic crisis, electricity tariffs were converted to the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> and frozen in January 2002 through the Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Law. Together with high inflation (see Economy of Argentina) and the devaluation of the peso, many companies in the sector had to deal with high levels of debt in foreign currency under a scenario in which their revenues remained stable while their costs increased. This situation has led to severe underinvestment and unavailability to keep up with an increasing demand, factors that contributed to the 2003-2004 energy crisis. Since 2003, the government has been in the process of introducing modifications that allow for tariff increases. Industrial and commercial consumers' tariffs have already been raised (near 100% in nominal terms and 50% in real terms), but residential tariffs still remain the same.|$|E

A substantial increase occurred in 2008, from 26.5 million to 63.5 million <b>Argentine</b> <b>pesos,</b> due to the sale of long-owned land, hotel rentals, and time deposits in <b>Argentine</b> <b>pesos</b> and U.S. dollars. They founded a business-consulting company, El Chapel and established the Hotesur SA and Los Sauces firms to manage their luxury hotels in El Calafate.

De la Rúa exploited {{that description}} in television advertisements, embracing it and setting a {{comparison with the}} glitzy style of Menem and the perceived political corruption of his administration. He also compared himself with the Peronist candidate Eduardo Duhalde. He promised to solve the economic crisis with fiscal austerity and higher tax controls, hoping it would lower interest rates, bring more foreign investments, and reduce unemployment. He also promised to keep the Convertibility plan established by Menem that pegged the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Peso</b> one-to-one with the United States dollar.|$|E
500|$|Belgrano {{appears on}} a number of {{currencies}} in the numismatic history of Argentina.

He was later included on the 10,000 pesos banknotes of the pesos argentinos, the highest banknote value in circulation. The Argentine austral had [...] a number of political and military figures that did not include Belgrano, but later the 10,000 pesos argentinos banknotes were allowed to be used as australes.

2500|$|One of Macri's first {{economic}} policies was {{the removal of}} currency controls, allowing Argentines to freely buy and sell foreign currencies. Argentina has had a floating exchange rate since then, with intervention from its central bank, and the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> was devalued by 30 percent. Economists described the move as [...] "perfectly orchestrated". Another early policy was the removal of export quotas and tariffs on corn and wheat. Tariffs on soybeans, the most lucrative Argentine export, were reduced from 35 to 30 percent.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Argentine winemakers were {{traditionally}} {{more interested}} in quantity than quality with the country consuming 90% of the wine it produces ( [...] per capita according to 2006 figures). Until the early 1990s, Argentina produced more wine {{than any other country}} outside Europe, though the majority of it was considered unexportable. However, the desire to increase exports fueled significant advances in quality. Argentine wines started being exported during the 1990s, and are currently growing in popularity, making it now the largest wine exporter in South America. The devaluation of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>peso</b> in 2002 further fueled the industry as production costs decreased and tourism significantly increased, giving way to a whole new concept of enotourism in Argentina.|$|E
