5|$|Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, {{argues that}} the play is a veiled warning against {{considering}} PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would {{have been aware of}} the Japanese occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message which had to be conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, and suggests that the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear of the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May and 17, {{the main}} Austrian army under Charles {{arrived in the}} Marchfeld, a plain {{northeast}} of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept {{the bulk of his}} forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles learned from his observers on the Bissam hill that the French were building a bridge at Kaiser-Ebersdorf, just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On the 21st, Charles concluded that the French were crossing at Kaiser-Ebersdorf in strength and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> 292 guns, which were organised into five columns. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern-Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been lighted on fire.|$|E

At 17:30, Königs crew spotted both the IScouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port.

5|$|Tech {{recovered}} from the loss by winning its next five games, including a last-second victory over 19th-ranked Nebraska and a 31-7 blowout victory over No. 9 Miami. The victories brought Tech to a 5-1 record and a No. 4 national ranking. On October 17, Virginia Tech traveled to Atlanta {{for the second time}} that season, this time to play 19th-ranked Georgia Tech. For the first time since 1962, Georgia Tech defeated a top-five team, beating Virginia Tech 28-23. Georgia Tech's win gave it a tiebreaker against Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference standings, but Virginia Tech made the tiebreaker moot by losing its next game, an ACC contest against North Carolina. Georgia Tech lost only one ACC game all season, a record that won it the ACC's Coastal Division <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> spot in the ACC Championship Game ahead of Virginia Tech, which was No. 2 in the division.|$|E
5|$|The Khmer Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E

The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E
5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The plains {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E

He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 {{he was one of the}} last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.|$|E
