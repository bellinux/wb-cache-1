5|$|By the 1890s, Svalbard {{had become}} a {{destination}} for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were {{being used as a}} base for Arctic exploration. The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. Production in Longyearbyen, by <b>American</b> <b>interests,</b> started in 1908; and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying <b>American</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bennington served In the Pacific for {{a little}} more than four years. For the most part, her duty {{consisted}} of cruising along the west coast protecting <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in Latin America during the numerous political upheavals that occurred at that time in Central and South America. In addition, she made two extended cruises to the Hawaiian Islands. The first came after a group of pro-royalists attempted in January 1895 to stage a countercoup against the provisional government of the islands. Bennington departed Mare Island on 28 May, arrived at Honolulu on 5 June, and spent the next nine months protecting <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the islands. On 5 March 1896, she departed Honolulu, bound for San Francisco where she arrived on 16 March. The following day, the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for five months of repairs.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1927, Shoup {{and nine}} other {{officers}} were pulled from training to accompany a detachment of Marines sent to China to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> during {{the instability of}} the Chinese Civil War. Embarking from San Diego with the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, Shoup's contingent was to play a primarily defensive role, and not engage in military action. Still, he was personally opposed to the mission, feeling that Americans in China were exploiting its people. The contingent landed in Shanghai on 10 June aboard USS Chaumont. Initially, they conducted shore patrol around American sections of the city. On 5 July the battalion was moved to Tientsin to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> there should Chinese Nationalist troops threaten them. Shoup became seriously ill there, and remained hospitalized until it was announced U.S. troops would leave. He briefly returned to Shanghai to oversee foreign troop departures with the 4th Marines, before he departed from China on 7 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{then began}} a peacetime {{training}} routine off {{the east coast}} of the United States and the Caribbean, including gunnery training off the Virginia Capes, training cruises in the Atlantic, and winter exercises in Cuban waters. In late 1909, Virginia, Georgia, and Rhode Island visited French and British ports. Throughout their careers, political unrest in several Central American countries prompted the United States to send the ships to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the region. New Jersey was sent to Cuba to assist the Cuban Pacification in support of the government of President Tomás Estrada Palma. All five ships became involved in the Mexican Revolution as the United States intervened to protect its nationals living in the country, culminating in the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. New Jersey was also sent to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in Haiti and the Dominican unrest in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1907, she {{took part in the}} Jamestown Exposition and suffered an explosion in her aft 8-inch gun turret that killed or wounded 21men. At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training followed for the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|In late 1910, she {{sailed to}} Europe {{as part of}} Atlantic Fleet maneuvers, {{following}} which she spent about 14 months off the Atlantic coast, based alternately in Philadelphia and Norfolk, serving as a training ship and conducting operational exercises.

5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she {{attempted}} to draft a new constitution which would restore {{the power of the}} monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests,</b> which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the air campaign over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other <b>American</b> <b>interests,</b> including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of De Mauro remained a mystery and {{a matter for}} many speculations. In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta declared that the Sicilian Mafia {{had been involved in}} the murder of Mattei. He also claimed that De Mauro was killed because of his investigations into the death of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed {{at the request of the}} American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stop in}} Charleston, South Carolina, she {{continued}} south through the Caribbean Sea, arriving at Colón, Panama on 29 January. There, she joined the Special Service Squadron. This duty was interrupted twice; the first came in February, {{when she returned to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she {{and the rest of the}} Atlantic Fleet greeted the Great White Fleet at the conclusion of its circumnavigation of the globe. The second came in April, owing to instability in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution that threatened <b>American</b> <b>interests.</b> Montana departed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 2 April, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to protect Americans in the region. She remained there until 23 July, when she left Gibraltar, arriving in Boston on 3 August. She thereafter returned to her normal operations patrolling the eastern coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|After her June 1891 commissioning, Bennington was {{attached}} to the Squadron of Evolution and for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to the duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> there. On her way to support United States Army operations of the Philippine–American War, Bennington claimed Wake Island for the United States. After two years in the Philippines, she returned to the United States and was decommissioned for 18months of repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 re-commissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the ceremonies, Nebraska remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet. In late 1909 she took part in the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York. The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River. In 1912, Nebraska took part in a ceremony for the centennial anniversary of Louisiana's entrance into the United States. The ship was deployed to Mexico twice to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> during the Mexican Revolution, the first from 1 May to 21 June 1914, and the second from 1 June to 13 October 1916. For these actions, the ship was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. The ship was briefly decommissioned in 1916, but returned to service on 3 April 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve <b>American</b> <b>interests,</b> and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ceremonies, Ohio proceeded to New York, where she was based for the following four years. This time was spent conducting normal peacetime training with the fleet and assisting in the training of the New York Naval Militia. By 1914, the worsening conditions during the Mexican Civil War prompted the United States to begin intervening in the conflict. Ohio was sent to Mexican waters early that year to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the country. In mid-1914, she returned to the east coast of the United States to conduct a training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. After completing the cruise, Ohio was transferred to the Reserve Fleet based at Philadelphia. She returned to service only to conduct additional midshipmen cruises in the summers of 1915 and 1916.|$|E

5|$|Louisiana {{primarily}} operated {{along the}} east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career. In 190809, she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. A pair of trips to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911. From 1913, she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution, as the US Navy began to send ships to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the country. This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. During World War I, Louisiana was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918. After the war ended that year, she was used to ferry American soldiers back from France. With this work completed, she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Ohio {{initially}} {{served in}} the Asiatic Fleet, from 1905 to 1907, {{when she returned to}} the United States. In December that year, she joined the Great White Fleet for its world cruise, which lasted until early 1909. She served with the Atlantic Fleet {{for the next four years}} conducting a peacetime training routine. In 1914, she was sent to Mexico to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> in the country during the Mexican Revolution. She served as a training ship during America's involvement in World War I from 1917 to 1918. Thoroughly obsolete by that time, Ohio was decommissioned in July 1919, and was ultimately sold for scrap in March 1923 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina {{was back}} in Norfolk by 20 December, where she {{remained}} until 6 January 1913. She then departed for another trip south, this time to Colón, Panama, {{at the entrance to}} the recently completed Panama Canal. The ship then took part in maneuvers off Guantanamo Bay before returning to Norfolk on 22 March. Another cruise off the east coast of the United States followed, and included a stop in New York from 28 to 31 May, where the USS Maine National Monument was dedicated. The ship briefly trained midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in June before departing at the end of the month for Mexico. There, she cruised off Tampico and Veracruz to protect <b>American</b> <b>interests</b> during the Mexican Civil War. She returned to Norfolk for an overhaul in September that lasted until January 1914.|$|E
