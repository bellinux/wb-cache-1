5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

40|$|This {{resource}} sheet examines expenditure {{related to}} child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect {{that is made}} by departments responsible for child protection services in Australia. It finds that the direct economic costs of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are substantial. The additional costs associated with long-term effects of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect make the prevention of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect a priority. More importantly, the prevention of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect is a critical priority because of the social costs of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect and the imperative to prevent children from experiencing its devastating effects.

The purpose of this resource is to indicate the potential long-term effects of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect that may extend into adulthood. Child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect refers to any behaviour by parents, caregivers, other adults or older adolescents that is outside the norms of conduct and entails a substantial risk of causing physical or emotional harm to a child or young person. Such behaviours may be intentional or unintentional and can include acts of omission (i. e., neglect) and commission (i. e., abuse). The five main subtypes of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, neglect, sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> witnessing family violence...|$|R

40|$|Objective: There {{were two}} aims to this study: first {{to examine whether}} {{emotional}} <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the strength of these relationships after controlling {{for the effects of}} other types of childhood <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trauma. Method: Two-hundred and five women completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein et al., 1994), Trauma History Questionnaire (Green, 1996), the Symptom Checklist-revised (Derogatis, 1997), and the Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (Norris & Perilla, 1996) when presenting to their primary care physician for a visit. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect variables on symptom measures while controlling for childhood sexual <b>and</b> physical <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma exposure. Results: A history of emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect was associated with increased anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress and physical symptoms, as well as lifetime trauma exposure. Physical <b>and</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma were also significant predictors of physical and psychological symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect predicted symptomatology in these women even when controlling for other types of <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma exposure. Conclusions: Long-standing behavioral consequences may arise as a result of childhood emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect, specifically, poorer emotional and physical functioning, and vulnerability to further trauma exposure.

The three main psychological and medical databases (PsychInfo 1887 -March 2011; Medline, 1966 -March 2011; Web of Knowledge 1981 -March 2011) were searched. Thirty-seven papers on the topic of intimate partner <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> suicidality were found. With only one exception, all of the studies found a strong and consistent association between intimate partner <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> suicidality. Significantly, this relationship held irrespective of study design, sample <b>and</b> measurement of <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> suicidality, thus demonstrating a consistently strong relationship between intimate partner <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> suicidality. This review highlights that intimate partner abuse is a significant risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviours, which has important clinical implications...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has noted that}} a unidimensional latent construct underlies criteria for cannabis <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence. However, no study to date has explored whether gender contributes to heterogeneity in the latent <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence construct and furthermore, whether after accounting for differences in the mean scores of <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence across genders, there is any evidence for heterogeneity in the individual <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence criteria. The present study utilizes data on criteria for cannabis <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence from a large, nationally representative sample (National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions) of 8, 172 lifetime cannabis users to investigate whether gender contributes to heterogeneity in the underlying construct of cannabis <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence, and in each individual criterion as well. Analyses, {{all of which were}} conducted in MPlus, included factor analysis, as well as MIMIC and multiple-group models for an examination of dimensionality and gender heterogeneity, respectively. Results favor a uni-dimensional construct for cannabis abuse/dependence, as seen in prior research. We also identify 2 <b>abuse</b> (Legal <b>and</b> Hazard) and 2 dependence (Quit and Problems) criteria, which show significant gender heterogeneity with the abuse criteria exhibiting higher thresholds in women and the dependence criteria in men.
