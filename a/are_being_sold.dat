5|$|Susan {{is asked}} {{to act as a}} {{marriage}} celebrant for Coco Lee (Sophie Cheeseman), but she soon learns from Nate that Coco's fiancé, Alistair Hall (Nick Cain), kissed him. Susan refuses to perform the ceremony and Alistair makes a complaint against her, as he believes Susan told Coco about the kiss. He later drops the complaint. Karl and Susan take in Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns), while Ben comes to stay when Libby goes overseas for work. Susan supports Terese when she and Brad separate due to his affair with Lauren. They briefly fall out when Terese asks Susan to pick a side. Paul informs Susan that Erinsborough High and its grounds <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold</b> to Eden Hills Grammar. She later learns that she will not be kept on as principal and contemplates retirement. She and Brad then team up to save the school, organising a sleep-out in protest to the council's plans. A fire breaks out, trapping Susan with a heavily pregnant Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), who goes into labour. They are eventually rescued by the fire fighters. After seeing how upset Susan is about the school, Ben confesses to starting the fire. Susan later learns that the school has been saved.|$|E

500|$|In November 2015 the Union of Concerned Scientists {{published}} {{a new report}} comparing two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, cradle-to-grave analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, {{are based on the}} two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite taken into account the higher emissions associated with BEV manufacturing. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold,</b> excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets [...] in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold</b> in the United States in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a [...] fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reason for the fact that EV-related emissions have become even lower {{in many parts of the}} country since the first study was conducted in 2012. Electricity generation has been getting cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, have undergone improvements to increase their efficiencies compared to the original models launched in 2010, and other even more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient BMW i3, have entered the market.|$|E

2500|$|The recent {{growth of}} MREs listed on eBay (2005) has {{resulted}} in a government investigation of whether they were intended for Hurricane Katrina victims, and the news media nickname [...] "Meals Ready for eBay." [...] Some cases <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold</b> from Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and other Gulf states affected by Katrina. The internal cost of a 12 pack case of MREs is $86.98 (approx. $7.25 a meal) to the government, much higher than what is actually paid to vendors. That said, MREs can be purchased by civilians directly from the contractors who supply MREs to the United States Government. These MREs are very similar to genuine US Government MREs, differing only in minor details (i.e. design of case and bag or type of spoon).|$|E

2500|$|Georgescu was {{especially}} prolific {{in the final}} part of his career, when he reputedly identified with the slogan anul şi romanul ("a new novel every year"). According to Iulia Arsintescu, their quality declined as their author became [...] "plagued by an illness that was {{harder and harder to}} bear." [...] Beginning with Mai mult ca perfectul, Georgescu was creating a new cycle, with a focus on Huzurei. The narrator Miron Perieţeanu, himself a fictional version of Georgescu, tells the successive stories of Ioan, Luca, Matei and Marcu (names based on the Romanian versions for the Four Evangelists). The events in these novels also take place during the early 20th century, covering the 1907 peasants' revolt as well as the World War I occupation of the country. According to literary chronicler Ioan Holban, the Huzurei setting is [...] "a desolate place, stupefied by the torpor, with squeamish people always sweaty from the heat, moving idly from one tavern to another [...] and devoting themselves to that almighty goddess that is the siesta [...] This is only a first impression, for Huzurei is 'the living citadel' of its time , grouping, in between its ridiculous houses and streets, a diverse world, caught {{in the midst of a}} struggle over power and money: [...] crimes are being committed, intrigues, drug traffic networks and 'wholesale' exchanges are being set up, politics are hotly debated, predictions are being made, investigations, chases take place, dramas are being consumed, people eat vigorously, and nubile girls <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold</b> (bought) [...]" [...] The Huzurei narratives as a whole are thought by Cosaşu equal in value to some of their acclaimed predecessors: George Călinescu's Bietul Ioanide and Marin Preda's Moromeţii.|$|E
2500|$|... "Rock Band" [...] {{includes}} {{support for}} using pre-made and custom avatars to represent band members on stage during performances, as in previous Rock Band games. These avatars can include {{a variety of}} clothing styles, hair styles, accessories, makeup, and instruments to allow users to customize their performance. While custom characters {{have been a part}} of the Rock Band series from the start, Harmonix wants players to feel more connected with their characters and band within Rock Band 3. Harmonix' Chris Foster stated that they realized the game is wish-fulfillment for most players in taking one's band through the rise of success, and structured a weak, non-presuming narrative to help guide this without forcing any particular aspect of the band's story. One aspect to connecting the player to their band was to constantly show the characters throughout all parts of the game screens, such as on the main menus, during song selection and loading screens, and during practice mode. Another approach was to allow more detailed customization tools to encourage the player to create themselves or other characters as they wanted in the game. They wanted to advance the looks of the avatar characters, making them like living dolls with near-realistic features but highly idealized visual elements, such as smooth skin and hair. This was achieved through the use of improved shaders that gave the appearance of realistic surfaces but with the Rock Band stylized art aesthetic. [...] The team aimed to provide something that was in between the complex creation tool for Mass Effect and the simple set of tools for Miis. Rock Band 3 custom character creator allows for more direct customization of the character's facial looks, using a combination of pre-made face styles (including those already from Rock Band 2), facial components such as noses or chins, and adjustment sliders to change size, position, and other details. Numerous additional hair styles are available in addition to the existing elaborate and showy styles from the previous game. Additional controls can be used to further adjust the tone of the character's body, and players are able to apply tattoos across most anywhere on the character's body. Players can then get clothing and instruments in the various in-game shops, with items becoming unlocked as the player progresses through the game. In addition, premium T-shirts with real-life bands <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>sold</b> as downloadable content for the players' created characters.|$|E
