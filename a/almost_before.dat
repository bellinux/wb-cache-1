5|$|The Battle of Marengo was {{the victory}} that sealed {{the success of}} Bonaparte's Italian {{campaign}} of 1800 and is best understood {{in the context of}} that campaign. By a daring crossing of the Alps with his Army of the Reserve (officially commanded by Louis Alexandre Berthier) in mid-May 1800 <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> the passes were open, Bonaparte (who crossed on a mule) had threatened Melas's lines of communications in northern Italy. The French army then seized Milan on 2 June, followed by Pavia, Piacenza and Stradella, Lombardy, cutting the main Austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the Po river. Bonaparte hoped that Melas's preoccupation with the Siege of Genoa, held by General André Masséna, would prevent the Austrians from responding to his offensive. However, Genoa surrendered on 4 June, freeing a large number of Austrians for operations against the French.|$|E

That began to change in April 1953 when the wing acquired its first five North American T-28 Trojans.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the coins}} have a smooth edge, rather than reeded {{as with other}} silver coins, the new piece {{was close to the}} size of, and {{immediately}} confused with, the quarter. [...] Adding to the bewilderment, the obverse, or [...] "heads", sides of both coins were almost identical. [...] After the first year, in which over a million were minted, there was little demand, and the denomination was abolished in 1878. [...] At least a third of the total mintage was later melted by the government. Numismatist Mark Benvenuto called the twenty-cent piece [...] "a chapter of U.S. coinage history that closed <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> it began".|$|E

[...] By {{the end of the first}} minute, the Dark Blues were a few feet ahead but with the bend in the river favouring Cambridge, the crews were level by Craven Steps.

The Hamersley Development Scheme, however, was doomed <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> it started. Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding {{of power and the}} time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme's approval. In July 1970, the Shire Planner reported that [...] "there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme, especially in view of the large areas already subdivided", and recommended the council agree [...] "that for all practical purposes, Town Planning Scheme No. 26. is defunct". By the February 1971 state election, over 1,000 eligible voters lived in the district.|$|E

For the 1985 Levi's 501 commercial, [...] "Launderette", featuring male model Nick Kamen, agency BBH and director Roger Lyons, owing to budgetary constraints, brought in Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge to recreate the sound of the Marvin Gaye original with Tony Jackson, a Barbadian background singer for Paul Young, handling vocals and P. P. Arnold on backing vocals. The commercial's success prompted Tamla-Motown to re-release Gaye's single with the Levi's 501 logo on the sleeve — [...] "an example of integrated marketing <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> the term was invented". The record went to number eight on the UK Singles chart, marking its second chart performance. A year later, in 1986, Buddy Miles was the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins which sang it as part a TV advertising campaign.|$|E
500|$|When Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died on 13 August 1447, {{the city}} was thrown into {{confusion}} by his [...] unexpected demise and {{the speed with which}} claimants to his title acted. Filippo Maria had no heir through male bloodlines, but the day before his death he had written a will bequeathing the Duchy to Alfonso V of Aragon. [...] Among the other claimants were Charles, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Filippo Maria through his mother Valentina Visconti; Filippo's cousins Albert and Sigismund of the House of Habsburg, great-grandsons of Bernabò Visconti; and Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared that the Duchy reverted to the Holy Roman Empire on the extinction of its male heirs. [...] The two most prominent candidates supported by the Milanese population were however Alfonso of Aragon and Francesco Sforza, the Duke's son-in-law by marriage to his illegitimate daughter, Bianca Maria Visconti. [...] The Bracceschi family, supporters of the King of Aragon, seized the Castello {{on the night of the}} 13th, <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> Filippo Maria died, forcing the captains to swear allegiance to Alfonso.|$|E

On 1 April, while the 1st Air Fleet was starting its raid in the Indian Ocean, Malay Force, consisting of Ryūjō, six cruisers, and four destroyers, left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal. B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups. Ryūjōs aircraft bombed the small ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam on the southeastern coast of India the next day, doing little damage, in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day. The carrier and her escorts, the light cruiser [...] and the destroyer Yugiri claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire. All together, Malay Force sank 19 ships totaling <b>almost</b> , <b>before</b> reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April.

Arthur, Jr. {{was the son}} of Scottish-born jurist and politician Arthur MacArthur, Sr., Arthur would later receive the Medal of Honor for his actions with the Union Army in the Battle of Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War, and be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Pinkney came from a prominent Norfolk, Virginia, family. Two of her brothers had fought for the South in the Civil War, and refused to attend her wedding. Arthur and Pinky had three sons, of whom Douglas was the youngest, following Arthur III, born on 1 August 1876, and Malcolm, born on 17 October 1878. The family lived on a succession of Army posts in the American Old West. Conditions were primitive, and Malcolm died of measles in 1883. In his memoir, Reminiscences, MacArthur wrote [...] "I learned to ride and shoot even before I could read or write—indeed, <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> I could walk and talk." ...|$|E

2500|$|This civilization {{seems to}} have fallen into decline by the late Bronze Age, when, {{according}} to Herodotus, Macedonian tribes from the north (called Dorians by those they conquered) marched into Peloponnese and, subjugating the local tribes, settled there. [...] The Dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of Spartan territory <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> they had established their own state. [...] They fought against the Argive Dorians {{to the east and}} southeast, and also the Arcadian Achaeans to the northwest. [...] The evidence suggests that Sparta, relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the Taygetan plain, was secure from early on: it was never fortified.|$|E

Among the condemnations is one by Jerome which refers to an apparent oral form of contraception: [...] "Some {{go so far as to}} take potions, that they may insure barrenness, and thus murder human beings <b>almost</b> <b>before</b> their conception." [...] Augustine, in On Marriage and Concupiscence, states that whoever merely involving lust in intercourse without intending procreation, [...] "although they be called husband and wife, are not; nor do they retain any reality of marriage, but use the respectable name [...] to cover a shame. ... Sometimes this lustful cruelty, or cruel lust, comes to this, that they even use sterilizing drugs." [...] The phrase [...] "sterilizing drugs" [...] (sterilitatis venena) was widely used in theological and ecclesiastical literatures to condemn any contraceptive acts and birth control. Augustine utilized the biblical story of Onan as a supporting text to denounce contraception.|$|E
