5|$|From 1959 through 1967 (with the {{exception}} of 1963), the show was regularly pre-empted by CBS's annual two-hour fall telecast of The Wizard of Oz, which was <b>always</b> shown on a Sunday from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. E.S.T. Because the 1939 film <b>always</b> drew such a huge TV audience, CBS's Nielsen ratings in the 7:00 P.M. time slot remained high.|$|E
5|$|Great kivas are <b>always</b> {{much larger}} and deeper than Chaco-style kivas. Whereas {{the walls of}} great kivas <b>always</b> extend above the {{surrounding}} landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas are flush with the surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are <b>always</b> separate from core structures. Great kivas almost <b>always</b> have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults, which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} thought that models {{must be more}} {{abundant}} than mimics, {{but this is not}} <b>always</b> so.|$|E
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was <b>always</b> about the lyrics and <b>always</b> about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|J. Jonah Jameson is {{depicted}} as {{the publisher of the}} Daily Bugle and is Peter Parker's boss and as a harsh critic of Spider-Man, <b>always</b> saying negative things about the superhero in the newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is <b>always</b> depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, {{the popular}} actress who marries Bobby. Although they {{divorced}} in 1967, Sandra {{said she has}} <b>always</b> truly and deeply loved him, and that she <b>always</b> will, and thus never remarried.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that <b>always</b> faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that <b>always</b> faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that <b>always</b> faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that <b>always</b> faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Parthia had <b>always</b> posed {{a threat}} to Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were {{the first step in}} {{expanding}} Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not <b>always</b> a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.|$|E

5|$|Several duties are {{performed}} by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who is <b>always</b> a Cardinal Bishop. If the Dean is not entitled {{to participate in the}} conclave owing to age, his place is taken by the Sub-Dean, who is also <b>always</b> a Cardinal Bishop. If the Sub-Dean also cannot participate, the senior Cardinal Bishop participating performs the functions.|$|E
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I <b>always</b> {{tell her}} this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world. I used to <b>always</b> say, 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up for me {{to work with her}} again this time.|$|E

5|$|The Judge was <b>always</b> {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, {{with his}} sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people <b>always</b> crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|The neck: {{the narrowest}} {{part of the}} chase, <b>always</b> located near the {{foremost}} end of the piece.|$|E
5|$|We were <b>always</b> {{trying to}} pry assets {{out of the}} Air Force at times and places they didn't want to go. You had to push'em, cajole'em, at times {{threaten}} them... My people were <b>always</b> trying to corrupt the process because the process itself simply was not structured for our kind of war... It was a continual frustration.|$|E
5|$|When {{the islanders}} were reproached with their ignorance or {{insensibility}} of {{the wonders of}} Staffa, they had not much to reply. They had indeed considered it little, because they had <b>always</b> seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they <b>always,</b> are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty.|$|E

25|$|Applicative order: The rightmost, {{innermost}} redex is <b>always</b> reduced first. Intuitively {{this means}} a function's arguments are <b>always</b> reduced before the function itself. Applicative order <b>always</b> attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.|$|E
25|$|This {{information}} {{brings a}} lot of emotional turmoil for Hikari even more when she goes to Mao Natsukawa for support and he turns his back on her, tired of <b>always</b> coming to sloppy seconds to Ooishi. Natsukawa is frustrated with her, since Hikari is <b>always</b> focusing herself on Ooishi even though she <b>always</b> knew deep inside that Ooishi (while he was developing feelings for her at first) <b>always</b> thought {{of her as a}} friend or a little sister.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{notes that}} the option of {{rewriting}} is <b>always</b> available but questions whether it is <b>always</b> worth the trouble.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of this metre {{is different from the}} iambic senarius or trochaic septenarius. In Plautus there almost <b>always</b> a break (diaeresis) {{in the middle of the}} line. Unless the diaeresis (central break) is omitted, then by Meyer's law there is <b>always</b> a short syllable in the penultimate place before the break. At the end of the line there is <b>always</b> a stress on the penultimate element.|$|E
