25|$|Still later, wind-tunnel {{testing was}} applied to automobiles, {{not so much to}} {{determine}} aerodynamic forces per se but more to determine ways to reduce the power required to move the vehicle on roadways at a given speed. In these studies, the interaction between the road and the vehicle plays a significant role, and this interaction must be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. In an actual situation the roadway is moving relative to the vehicle but the air is stationary relative to the roadway, but in the wind tunnel the air is moving relative to the roadway, while the roadway is stationary relative to the test vehicle. Some automotive-test wind tunnels have incorporated moving belts under the test vehicle in an effort to approximate the <b>actual</b> <b>condition,</b> and very similar devices are used in wind tunnel testing of aircraft take-off and landing configurations.|$|E

After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an <b>actual</b> <b>condition</b> and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like we made a mistake this time. We felt bad about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E

In his book Los Comanches, {{historian}} Stanley Noyes notes that a [...] "violation of a council represented an almost unthinkable degree of perfidy. The council was sacred not only to the [...] People but to all Native Americans". In response, the captives the Texians sought were killed and Buffalo Hump launched the Great Raid of 1840, leading hundreds of Comanche warriors on raids against many Texian villages. The Texians were even more shocked and disgusted by the actions of the barbaric Comanches in torturing to death the innocent captives. The Texians had endured several years of murder and capture of their children and were disgusted at the condition of Matilda Lockhart upon her release, though Lockhart's <b>actual</b> <b>condition</b> is disputed and may have been exaggerated (see above discussion). At least 25 settlers were killed in the Great Raid, with others taken prisoner, including a Mrs. Crosby, a granddaughter of Daniel Boone, who was later murdered by her captors. Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of goods were taken; one city was burned to the ground and another damaged. The Texian militia responded, leading to the Battle of Plum Creek in August 1840, and ultimately stopped the raids.|$|E

There are a great number of applicants for teaching posts in our college and about 70 % of students have been taking this course every year since its establishment in 2003. Only few of them, however, can become teachers. There also have been discussions about teacher education among faculties in our college and we have not established a consensus yet. Many problems have been emerging from such a situation. The purpose of the paper is to examine <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> and problems and propose the point of view toward improvement of the teacher-training course. At first, we described the <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> of this course in terms of learning process（participants, curriculum, and classes）, learning results（teacher adoption）, and management. Secondly, we compared the <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> of our course with those of other sport colleges and universities based on data obtained from a mail survey and characterized the <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> of our course. Finally, we clarified problems from these findings and discussed their solutions. Further we proposed a future policy for teacher education in our college...|$|R

This little change had the appearance of something like success, and it greatly encouraged the corporal.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> on the work-life balance of {{childhood}} education and care workers in Japan by using some governmental statistics. Data from various secondary studies {{are used to}} examine their <b>actual</b> <b>conditions.</b> The author mainly used statistics made by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Concretely, it includes various statistics of the kinds and amounts of workplaces, founders of institutions and schools, their forms of employment, average data on age, wage, retirement etc. of workers. We found that the <b>actual</b> <b>conditions</b> on the work-life balance of childhood education and care workers is very oppressive. Namely, they still work {{for a very long}} time and their average wages are cheaper than other industrial workers. In their workplaces they experience early retirement on the average of about ten years, apart from some exceptions. In conclusion, there are few discussions on the work-life balance of childhood education and care workers in Japan...|$|R
