5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> Japanese {{invasion}} caused {{people to}} move west; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly.

5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} for {{a breakthrough in}} film, Chastain had six releases in 2011, getting wide recognition for her roles in several of them. The first of these roles was as the wife of Michael Shannon's character in Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter. The drama {{tells the story of}} a troubled father who tries to protect his family from <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> storm. It was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and the critic Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative. She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for the film.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|E

A re-allocation of resources towards more on-demand content, based on a review of customer viewing habits was provided as the reason for the reduction in linear channels; however, pricing for the service's entry level packages was to remain unchanged. On 6 June 2017, Foxtel announced a company wide rebrand, which was to include the renaming of Foxtel Play to Foxtel Now from 7 June 2017. Other changes included the addition of high-definition (HD) availability and Chromecast support on the service.|$|R

5|$|The midget {{submarine}} attacks and subsequent bombardments {{are among the}} best-known examples of Axis naval activity in Australian waters during World War II, and are the only occasion in history when either city has come under attack. The physical effects were slight: the Japanese had intended to destroy several major warships, but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during the bombardments. The main impact was psychological; creating popular fear of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> Japanese invasion and forcing the Australian military to upgrade defences, including the commencement of convoy operations to protect merchant shipping.|$|E

Indeed, in an {{interview}} with Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that he wants it to be the final fight of his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|Amid renewed rumours of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> Rhodesian UDI, Smith {{travelled}} to meet Wilson in London at {{the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and hardware complexity of superscalar architectures is hindered by conditional branch instructions. When conditional branches are encountered in a program, the instruction fetch unit must rapidly predict the branch predicate and begin speculatively fetching instructions with {{no loss of}} instruction throughput. Speculative execution increases hardware cost, since speculative instructions must be cleanly aborted if the branch is mis-predicted. Speculative execution also does not scale well for increasingly superscalar architectures, since mis-prediction probabilities and penalties grow as more branches are encountered. The future branch is an additional instruction that helps overcome the performance bottleneck of conditional branches. A future branch separates the specification of <b>a</b> <b>impending</b> branch (and the conditional predicate) from the actual branch location. The future branch instruction includes a branch source address (the location of the impending conditional b [...] ...|$|R

5|$|As news of <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> raid {{spread across}} the state, Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state's militia force, the Indiana Legion, to defend against the threat. Unaware {{of the size of}} the invading army, four {{companies}} of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion, totaling about one hundred men, attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, but were overcome by superior artillery fire, killing two of the defenders. The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan. Along with the townspeople, they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon. Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany, only about 450 men (consisting almost entirely of locals) were defending the town.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E

They try to stop <b>an</b> <b>impending</b> war between two neighboring kingdoms. Among his most expensive enterprises, the film project was difficult to finance. Ray abandoned his desire to shoot it in color, as he turned down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain Hindi film actor as the lead.|$|E
