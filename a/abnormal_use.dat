50|$|Emile Garcke, and John Manger Fells (1912/1922) {{explained}} the most regular system {{of dealing with}} machine rates in those days.It {{has been suggested that}} the time rate for each machine should be {{based on the assumption that}} it is being worked continuously to its full capacity. Thereby the advantage, or the disadvantage, of the use of the particular machine relatively to manual labour or other machines, the effect of insufficiency of orders to keep the plant fully employed, will be more manifest, and the extent to which economies in production could be carried under other circumstances more clearly shown. As machinery is often not continuously employed to its maximum extent the adoption of this procedure would generally entail less than the actual lessened value of the machinery being written off to the various Stock or other orders during any given period. The further suggestion has therefore been made that the balance remaining on each plant account, being the difference between the amounts charged off on the before mentioned assumption, and the actual lessened value should be charged off by means of a supplementary rate to an Idle Capacity account, as representing a loss, or more correctly, a non-realised gain, consequent upon the non-utilisation of the plant to its full capacity. The information thus obtained would be of great value to the manufacturer in considering how he can, having regard to market and other conditions, realise from his plant the maximum economic advantage. The importance of this consideration cannot be too strongly emphasised, for whilst in the case of labour the number of employees directly engaged in production can be regulated from time to time by the volume of trade, such readjustment is not possible in the case of machines whose maintenance, standing charges, and depreciation have to be provided for, whether idle or employed. Sequentially they {{explained the}} system proposed by Whitmore and perfected by Church:Another mode of dealing with machine rates is to fix a normal rate per hour for the use of any particular machine, and charge the stock or other order accordingly, and to adjust these results from time to time by means of an additional rate which would be based on the fluctuations of trade, and the <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> or otherwise of the machine. If the results of the additional rates are charged off to the Stock or other orders, without being specially noted, it would seem that so good a measure of the idle capacity of the plant would not be obtained as by the procedure before described.* It is desirable that separate rates should be fixed for the Productive Hour and the Idle Hour.|$|E

40|$|Background: Treacher-Collins {{syndrome}} is a congenital craniofacial disorder with multiple anomalies. This syndrome affects the maxilla, mandible, eyes, middle and outer ears, and soft palate. Conductive hearing loss {{due to the}} deformities of the middle and external ears is prevalent. The characteristics of this syndrome include multiple and serious threats to normal communication development in children. In this study, speech and language features of a Persian speaking child with this syndrome are presented. Case: The case was an 8 -year old girl with Treacher-Collins syndrome and bilateral moderate conductive hearing loss due to atretic canal. In language and speech assessments, moderate hypernasality, numerous compensatory errors and morphosyntactic deficits were observed. There were 13 phonemes that were incorrectly produced at least in one position. Besides, she used 22 types of phonological processes that were abnormal and disappear {{before the age of}} three in normal Persian speaking children. Conclusion: Moderate hearing loss, velopharyngeal incompetency, malocclusion and dental anomalies, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and environmental factors resulted in severe speech and language disorders in this case.

First, in SLI one sees isolated language impairments {{in the context of}} otherwise normal development, whereas in autism a triad of impairments is seen, affecting communication, social interaction and behavioural repertoire.

First, children with autism have structural language impairments similar to those in SLI. Second, some children have symptoms intermediate between autism and SLT. Third, there is a high rate of language impairments in relatives of people with autism, suggesting aetiological continuities between SLI and autism. One interpretation of these findings is to regard autism as 'SLI plus', i. e. to assume that the only factor differentiating the disorders is the presence of additional impairments in autism. It is suggested that a more plausible interpretation is to regard structural and pragmatic language impairments as correlated but separable consequences of common underlying risk factors...|$|E

40|$|According to the Dual Mechanisms of Control framework, {{cognitive}} control {{consists of}} two complementary components: proactive control refers to anticipatory maintenance of goal-relevant information, whereas reactive control acts as a correction mechanism that is activated when a conflict occurs. Possibly, the well-known diminished inhibitory control in response to negative stimuli in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients stems from a breakdown in proactive control, and/or anomalies in reactive cognitive control. In our study, MDD patients specifically showed increased response latencies when actively inhibiting a dominant response to a sad compared with a happy face. This condition {{was associated with a}} longer duration of a dominant ERP topography (800 - 900 ms poststimulus onset) and a stronger activity in the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting abnormal reactive control when inhibiting attention to a negative stimulus. Moreover, MDD patients showed abnormalities in proactive cognitive control when preparing for the upcoming imperative stimulus (abnormal modulation of the contingent negative variation component), accompanied by more activity in brain regions belonging to the default mode network. All together, deficits to inhibit attention to negative information in MDD might originate from an <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of both proactive resources and reactive control processes.

40|$|A core {{feature of}} autism is the <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of gaze to {{attribute}} mental states to others, {{and thus to}} predict others' behaviour. An untested idea is whether this dysfunction is confined to mental states having a propositional content, such as beliefs and desire or extends to motor intentional states which allow one to make inferences about the actions of others. This study used kinematics to examine {{the ability to use}} gaze to inform one about the motor states of another in normal and autistic children. In each trial two participants, a model and an observer, were seated facing each other at a table. In three experimental blocks the model was requested to grasp a stimulus, to gaze towards the same stimulus, and to gaze away from the stimulus without performing any action. The task for the observer was to grasp the stimulus after having watched the model perform her task. We observed that normal children showed facilitation effects in terms of movement speed following the observation of the model grasping or simply gazing at the object. In contrast, autistic children did not show any evidence of facilitation in these conditions. Neither normal nor autistic children showed evidence of facilitation when the model's gaze was not directed towards the stimulus. These findings demonstrate that, in contrast to normal children, children with autism fail to use information from the model's action or gaze to plan their subsequent action, and that in autism the inability to use of another person's gaze produces a lack of understanding of the motor intention of others...|$|E

In particular, the Internet {{has become part of}} the critical infrastructure and has a strategic importance in our society and in the digital economy. These developments have led to a highly dynamic network utilization, where traffic fluctuations and seemingly random and anomalous traffic patterns are commonly manifested and hard to diagnose. In order to ensure the protection and resilience of such networks, it is necessary to better analyze and observe network traffic. Thus, anomaly diagnosis aims to discover and characterize critical anomalies affecting the network infrastructure, where the source of these anomalies may be deliberately malicious (e. g. attacks) or unintentional (e. g. failures, misconfigurations or legitimate but <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of the network such as in flash crowds).

Many important eye diseases {{as well as}} systemic diseases manifest themselves in the retina of the eye and retinal image analysis is very intricate task.

Hence, early detection of diabetic retinopathy condition is very crucial to prevent blindness.

Total AAs increased in arterial blood much more in patients with CRF after AA ingestion than in control subjects, {{as a consequence of}} an exaggerated increase in nonessential AAs (NEAAs) (+ 127 %). Moreover, total AAs were taken up by the leg in larger amounts than in control subjects (+ 71 %, P < 0. 0025) because of increased uptake of NEAAs (+ 156 %, P < 0. 005). Branched-chain AA uptake by the leg was, in absolute values, similar to that of control subjects; however, because of the increased uptake of total AAs, branched-chain AA uptake was only 30 % of total AA extraction, compared with 46 % in control subjects. Abnormalities in AA uptake by muscle paralleled those in arterial AAs. In fact the same AAs that increased abnormally in blood were taken up by the leg at higher rates than in control subjects. Variations in arterial concentrations and muscle uptake of AAs were inversely related to arterial bicarbonate concentration, suggesting a role for acid-base status in modifying both the arterial supply and muscle metabolism of AAs. Results indicate that in CRF patients the normal pattern of postprandial AA repletion is disrupted. Muscle tissue faces the increased and unbalanced postprandial supply of AAs with an augmented and unbalanced uptake. Data are consistent with an <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of exogenous AAs in CRF patients, possibly induced by metabolic acidosi...|$|E

Previously they {{were based on}} Lead, Nickel-Cadmium and Nickel metal hydride technologies, but at the present Li-ion are considered more efficient in energy density. Unfortunately, these batteries use carbonated solvents as electrolytes which lead to safety issues because of their high tlammability and low flash points.

Several trends were subsequently obtained, depending on the anion, the alkyl chain length, the functionalities and the c 2 -H substitution. But TGA does not give information on the nature of volatile emissions, so the comparison between c 1 c 4 ImNTf 2 and PYR 14 NTf 2 with in situ and ex situ techniques has been carried out.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} use of terrorism in domestic Portugal throughout {{a significant part of}} the twentieth century, from the establishment of the Estado Novo to the formation and consolidation of democracy. Albeit with varying levels of impact in terms of the stigma inflicted upon the populace, and varying degrees of relevance in terms of capacity to mobilise for change or to achieve compliance, the argument to be discussed is that the phenomenon of terrorism has prevailed throughout this period of Portuguese history and has been present at the enfolding of crucial political transitions. Following a conceptual discussion on terrorism, an attempt is made to produce a definition based upon its behavioural essentials, pandemic to any social linkage in whatever political context. Since different stages of Portuguese history involve different actors engaged in terrorist practices, a review of theories on terrorism from which to profit from throughout the analysis is presented. The Estado Novo is analysed as a regime of intimidation, partially sustained by its terrorist practices and to some extent accountable for the on going disguised anaemia of the strong Portuguese spirit. The illegitimate and <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of force by the Estado Novo raises problems regarding the classification of the organisations that chose the path of violent opposition to the regime, difficulties that are overcome by the definition of terrorism developed in this work. An attempt is made to describe these organizations, to clarify their origins, ideology, internal backup and external support, as well as understand their modus operandi, evaluate their relevance and explain their disappearance. The practice of terrorism is also observed in the aftermath of the 25 April during the period of establishment and consolidation of democracy in Portugal. Emerging both at the left and the right of the political spectrum, this activity is firstly analysed as a reflection of the clash between revolutionary change and counter-revolution, and then is studied in the light of a democratic norm. An attempt is made to describe the major terrorist organizations of both the radical right and the extreme left.   The processes of controlling and pacifying Portuguese society are henceforth presented, clarifying the path that transformed Portugal into a society devoid of the terrorist phenomena.

40|$|Is there {{a double}} {{standard}} {{when it comes to}} the moral acceptability of fiction that encourages the imagination of acts that violate moral norms of harm and moral norms of purity? Observations of ethics, legal proceedings, and public reactions to different types of media seems to suggest so. Over six experiments this phenomenon, coined the fictive pass asymmetry, will be tested. The fictive pass asymmetry hypothesis proposes that fictional contexts including imagination, film, and virtual environments, will mitigate the condemnation of harm code violations more so than purity code violations. In other words, fictional representations of harm are given a "fictive pass" in moral condemnation, but the fictional representation of purity code violations that involve an <b>abnormal</b> <b>use</b> of one's body are denied a pass, and thus evaluated more similarly across real and fictional contexts. Chapters 1 through 3 introduce the fictive pass asymmetry and review the literature that provide its theoretical framework. Chapter 4 presents three experiments that establish initial evidence in support of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. Experiment 1 presented participants (N = 431) with vignettes that described agents committing either sexual acts or violent acts that were described as occurring in real life, being performed in a video game, or watched in a film. Experiments 2 and 3 (N = 360 and N = 321, respectively) systematically improved methodology by expanding upon the fictive contexts and creating manipulations based more strictly on the moral psychology literature. Chapter 5 presents experiment 4 (N = 312) and experiment 5 (N = 352) which deepened the understanding of the fictive pass asymmetry effects by using mediation analyses to demonstrate how the perceived wrongness of fictional purity code violations can be explained by the extent to which they signal poor moral character. Lastly, chapter 6 contains a final experiment (N = 484) and a series of meta-analyses. The final experiment considers fictive pass asymmetry effects in relation to an opposing theoretical framework, validates a number of manipulations, and tests the presumption of desire as an alternate explanation of fictive pass asymmetry effects. Finally, the meta-analyses aggregate the data of these experiments to highlight the robustness of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. Chapter 7, the concluding chapter, reviews the experiments and discusses the results in regards to theories of anger and disgust, moral theories of act and character, as well as the fictive pass asymmetry's implications in media use and regulation...|$|E

Im Rahmen dieser Diplomarbeit findet eine Auseinandersetzung mit Computerspielsucht im Zusammenhang mit der dialektisch-behavioralen Therapie statt. So wird der Frage nachgegangen, welche Konzepte und Potentiale die dialektisch-behaviorale Therapie im Zusammenhang mit Computerspielsucht hat. Ziel soll sein, aus der dialektisch-behavioralen Therapie, welche ursprünglich für Personen mit einer Borderline-Persönlichkeitsstörung auf Basis der Verhaltenstherapie entwickelt wurde, Konzepte herauszuarbeiten, die Potentiale für die Therapie von Betroffenen von Computerspielsucht haben. Nachdem eine genaue Auseinandersetzung mit den beiden Themengebieten „Computerspielsucht“ und „dialektisch behaviorale Therapie“ die ersten beiden Abschnitte der Diplomarbeit abdeckt, können im dritten Abschnitt der Arbeit die Potentiale ersichtlich werden. So stellen Verhaltens- und Kettenanalysen aus dem Konzept der Verhaltenstherapie ein wesentliches Potential dar. Ebenso können psychoedukative Elemente und eine dialektische Sichtweise als Potential für die therapeutische Arbeit gesehen werden. Wichtigstes Potential obliegt dem Fertigkeitentraining, von dem ausgehend eine Kombination zwischen Einzeltherapie und Fertigkeitentraining in der Therapie von computerspielsüchtigen Personen zum Einsatz kommen kann.

Furthermore concepts and potentials of the dialectical-behavior therapy in combination with addiction to computer games are analyzed. The author defined the aim of this research to analyze the possibility of an application of the concept and the potential of dialectical-behavior therapy - which was originally designed as a appraoch for patients with borderline-personality-disorder – to therapy addicts to computer games. Therefore the author defined addiction to computer games and the dialectical-behavior therapy in the first two sections of the present diploma thesis. However the third section of the paper reviews the potentials of the dialectical-behavior therapy in connection with possible treatment methods of addiction to computer games. As a result the author recognized a high potential of performance analysis and chain analysis based on the concept of the behavioral therapy. Furthermore the clients knowledge regarding the symptoms the consequences of his addiction and the dialectical point of view could also be seen as highly relevant to develop new therapy methods. In addition a combination of a single-therapy and a skillstrainig in therapy of addicts to computer games could be the key to a new approach.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{pulmonary}} diffusing capacity in healthy children primarily focused upon Caucasian (C) subjects. Since lung volumes in African-Americans (AA) {{are smaller than}} lung volumes in C subjects of the same height, diffusing capacity values in AA children might be interpreted as low or <b>abnormal</b> <b>using</b> currently available equations without adjusting for race. Healthy AA (N[*]=[*] 151) and C (N[*]=[*] 301) children between 5 and 18 years of age performed acceptable measurements of single breath pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and alveolar volume (VA) according to current ATS/ERS guidelines. The natural log of DLCO and VA were associated with height, gender, age, and race; AA children had lower DLCO and VA compared to C children. Adjustment of DLCO for Hemoglobin (Hgb) resulted in {{no significant difference in}} DLCO among these healthy subjects with normal Hgb. In summary, we report prediction equations for DLCO and VA that include adjustment for race (C; AA) demonstrating that AA have lower DLCO and VA compared to C children for the same height, gender, and age...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} parameter assessed {{during the}} semen analysis is the overall morphology, or {{shape of the}} sperm. Currently, the morphological analysis of sperm is done manually {{and is based on}} visual observation of at least 200 spermatozoa in a microscope followed by a classification stage based on strict criteria. But this method has led to incorrect results due to various factors such as different staining procedures, experience of technicians and human errors. So this paper focuses on morphological classification of spermatozoon either as normal or <b>abnormal</b> <b>using</b> Matlab. The first stage is the image preprocessing stage which involves the conversion of RGB image to a gray scale image and then image noises are removed using median filter. The second stage is the detection and extraction of individual spermatozoon which involves the extraction of sperm objects from images using sobel edge detection algorithm. The third stage segments the spermatozoon into various region of interest such as sperm head, midpiece and tail. The fourth stage involves the statistical measurement of spermatozoon which classifies Spermatozoa as normal or abnormal. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|Although 2 D speckle {{tracking}} echocardiography (STE) {{has been shown}} useful {{for the assessment of}} regional left ventricular (LV) function, it is limited by its 2 D nature. Our goal was to evaluate new 3 D-STE software by comparing regional wall motion (RWM) measurements against 2 D-STE, and testing its ability to identify RWM abnormalities. 2 D and real-time 3 D datasets obtained in 32 subjects were analyzed to measure radial, longitudinal and rotational indices of displacement and strain. Segments were classified as normal or <b>abnormal</b> <b>using</b> cardiac MRI. 3 D-STE and 2 D-STE indices did not correlate well and showed wide limits of inter-technique agreement despite the minimal biases. In normal segments, 3 D-STE showed: (1) higher displacements, due the out-of-plane motion component; (2) smaller SDs, indicating tighter normal ranges; (3) gradual decrease in displacement and reversal in rotation from base to apex. In abnormal segments, all 3 D-STE indices were reduced. In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the new 3 D-STE technique for measurements of RWM indices and demonstrate its superiority over 2 D-STE. 1...|$|R
