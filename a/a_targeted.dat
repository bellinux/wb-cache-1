5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in <b>a</b> <b>targeted</b> population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
50|$|Defining the {{difference}} between <b>a</b> <b>target</b> market and <b>a</b> <b>target</b> audience comes down to {{the difference}} between marketing and advertising.

5|$|Night {{sharks are}} quick, nocturnally active, {{schooling}} predators that feed mainly on small bony fishes and squid. Reproduction is viviparous {{as with the}} other members of its family; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 1218 pups after a gestation period of a year. This deepwater species is not known to pose a danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial tuna and swordfish longline fisheries in the western Atlantic, and also by <b>a</b> <b>targeted</b> longline fishery operating off northeastern Brazil. The night shark is highly valued for its fins, and additionally as a source of meat, liver oil, and fishmeal. However, most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury.|$|E

The stack was turned over to be used on the STS-119 mission instead. On 23 March, Atlantis was mated to its new stack in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA managers issued a request to move the STS-125 launch up one day to 11 May at 2:01pm EDT. The change was made official at the flight readiness review on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. <b>A</b> <b>targeted</b> gillnet fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E

30|$|The {{first phase}} of the system is {{candidate}} extraction. By projecting 3 D information acquired from a disparity image into a 3 D space, the candidate regions of <b>a</b> <b>target</b> are extracted. Second, <b>a</b> <b>target</b> region is distinguished from the others. In order to achieve the distinction, <b>a</b> <b>target</b> model is produced. The model is composed of <b>a</b> <b>target’s</b> color and location features. Finally, in the process of occlusion detection, the positional relationship between <b>a</b> <b>target</b> and the others is analyzed. Using the results of both the analysis and target identification, the occlusion state is estimated. Depending on the state, the appropriate procedure is followed.|$|R

30|$|Because of the {{inclusion}} of target-absent trials, five different categories of responses are possible in the task.
