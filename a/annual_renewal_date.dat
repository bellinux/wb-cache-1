40|$|Due to {{technological}} progress, recent {{performance is}} often more informative about future performance prospects than is older performance. We incorporate information decay in a career concern model in which performance depends on type and effort and contract renewal {{is based on the}} performance record. In contrast with the career concern literature (e. g. Lewis, 1986; RJE), contractors work harder when the project approaches <b>renewal</b> <b>date</b> and when their reputation is better. Productive investment are crowded out by window-dressing effort in late contract periods, but it is boosted in early periods. More frequent contract renewals strengthen reputational effects and result in improved performance if the relative cost of investment is low, but otherwise long-term contracts induce more effort. Our results are corroborated by some empirical studies showing that performance improves as the contract approaches <b>renewal</b> <b>date.</b> Career concerns, contract renewal and dynamic incentives. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough nitrate export in {{agricultural}} catchments has been simulated using {{various types of}} models, the role of groundwater in nitrate dynamics has rarely been fully taken into account. We used groundwater dating methods (CFC analyses) to reconstruct the original nitrate concentrations in the groundwater recharge in Brittany (Western France) from 1950 to 2009. This revealed {{a sharp increase in}} nitrate concentrations from 1977 to 1990 followed by a slight decrease. The recharge concentration curve was then compared with past chronicles of groundwater concentration. Groundwater can be interpreted as resulting from the annual dilution of recharge water in an uncontaminated aquifer. Two aquifers were considered: the weathered aquifer and the deeper fractured aquifer. The nitrate concentrations observed in {{the upper part of the}} weathered aquifer implied an <b>annual</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of 27 to 33 % of the reservoir volumewhile those in the lower part indicated an <b>annual</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of 2 - 3 %. The concentrations in the deep fractured aquifer showed an <b>annual</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of 0. 1 %. The river concentration can be simulated by combining these various groundwater reservoirswith the recharge. Winter and summer waters contain i) recharge water, or water from the variably saturated zone with rapid transfer and high nitrate concentrations, and ii) a large contribution (from 35 to 80 % in winter and summer, respectively) from the lower part of the aquifer (lower weathered aquifer and deep fractured aquifer). This induces not only a relatively rapid response of the catchment to variations {{in agricultural}} pressure, but also a potential inertia which has to be taken into account...|$|R
