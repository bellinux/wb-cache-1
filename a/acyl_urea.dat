40|$|Acyl ureas were {{discovered}} as a novel class of inhibitors for glycogen phosphorylase, a molecular target to control hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetics. This series is exemplified by 6 -{ 2, 6 -Dichloro- 4 -[3 -(2 -chloro-benzoyl) -ureido]-phenoxy}-hexanoic acid, which inhibits human liver glycogen phosphorylase a with an IC 50 of 2. 0 μM. Here we analyze four crystal structures of <b>acyl</b> <b>urea</b> derivatives in complex with rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b to elucidate {{the mechanism of}} inhibition of these inhibitors. The structures were determined and refined to 2. 26 Å resolution and demonstrate that the inhibitors bind at the allosteric activator site, where the physiological activator AMP binds. Acyl ureas induce conformational changes {{in the vicinity of}} the allosteric site. Our findings suggest that acyl ureas inhibit glycogen phosphorylase by direct inhibition of AMP binding and by indirect inhibition of substrate binding through stabilization of the T′ state...|$|E
40|$|FR 258900 {{has been}} {{discovered}} as a novel inhibitor of human liver glycogen phosphorylase a and proved to suppress hepatic glycogen breakdown and reduce plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic mice models. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we have determined the crystal structure of the cocrystallized rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b–FR 258900 complex and refined it to 2. 2 Å resolution. The structure demonstrates that the inhibitor binds at the allosteric activator site, where the physiological activator AMP binds. The contacts from FR 258900 to glycogen phosphorylase are dominated by nonpolar van der Waals interactions with Gln 71, Gln 72, Phe 196, and Val 45 ′ (from the symmetry-related subunit), and also by ionic interactions from the carboxylate groups to the three arginine residues (Arg 242, Arg 309, and Arg 310) that form the allosteric phosphate-recognition subsite. The binding of FR 258900 to the protein promotes conformational changes that stabilize an inactive T-state quaternary conformation of the enzyme. The ligand-binding mode is {{different from those of}} the potent phenoxy-phthalate and <b>acyl</b> <b>urea</b> inhibitors, previously described, illustrating the broad specificity of the allosteric site...|$|E
40|$|Journal URL: [URL] towards {{improving}} glycaemic {{control in}} {{type 2 diabetes}} have been directed towards developing inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) in collaboration with industry (Bayer, Novo Nordisk, Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, and Sanofi-Aventis Pharma). Inhibitors of hepatic GPa {{have the potential to}} be effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, as evidenced by studies showing glucose-lowering effects of these compounds. <b>Acyl</b> <b>ureas</b> were recently discovered as novel inhibitors of the enzyme. The X-ray structure of the screening hit 1 (IC 50 Ό 2 mM) revealed that 1 binds at the allosteric site, and induces conformational changes characteristic of a T-state conformation. Two cycles of chemical optimization supported by X-ray structural data of 21 (IC 50 of 23 _ 1 nM) in complex with human liver GPa (hlGPa) and by a 3 D pharmacophore model derived from a training set of 24 compounds led to 42 with improved cellular activity (hlGPa IC 50 Ό 53 _ 1 nM; hepatocyte IC 50 Ό 380 nM) and a significant reduction of the glucagon-induced hyperglycemic peak when administered to anaesthetized Wistar rats. Clinical studies to evaluate the use of <b>acyl</b> <b>ureas</b> for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are currently under way. Exposure of hepatocytes to <b>acyl</b> <b>ureas</b> promotes conversion of GPa to inactive GPb because the T-conformation is a better substrate for dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase- 1. Since GPa is an allosteric inhibitor of glycogen synthase phosphatase, depletion ofGPa by these compounds leads to sequential activation of glycogen synthase and stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Iminosugars (5, 8, 9), in contrast to <b>acyl</b> <b>ureas</b> inhibitors, promote conversion of GPb to GPa in hepatocytes, with consequent inactivation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of glycogen synthesis. The X-ray structures of 5, 8 and 9 in complex with muscle GPb show that iminosugars bind tightly at the catalytic site {{in the presence of the}} substrate phosphate, and induce conformational changes that characterise the R state conformation of the enzyme. Our results suggest that these compounds (IC 50 Ό 0. 4 – 1. 2 mM) function as oxocarbenium ion transitionstate analogues: the charged nitrogen N 1 is within hydrogen-bonding distance with the carbonyl oxygen of His 377 (5) and in ionic contact with the substrate phosphate oxygen (8 and 9). The present evidence from X-ray crystallography that <b>acyl</b> <b>ureas</b> and iminosugars cause the R to T transition and vice versa, respectively, provides the explanation for the metabolic studies in hepatocyte...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the searching for novel antimycobacterial active agents is continually increasing with growing mycobacterial resistance to currently used drugs. However, the resistance-related problems are also associated with other bacteria and fungi. The systematic modification of compounds with a known antimicrobial activity {{represents one of the}} possible approaches to overcome this problem. Sulphonamide derivatives may be considered to be such a kind of compounds. That is why we synthesized various sulphathiazole derivatives. Amides were obtained by the reaction of sulphathiazole with appropriate <b>acyl</b> chlorides, substituted <b>ureas</b> from corresponding isocyanates. These ureas were cyclized via oxalyl chloride to form substituted 2, 4, 5 -trioxoimidazolidines. Among derivatives evaluated for their antimycobacterial action, 4 -(3 - phenethylureido) -N-(thiazol- 2 -yl) benzenesulphonamide showed the highest activity. Its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis My 331 / 88 (4 µmol/l) were superior to those obtained for sulphathiazole. In the case of nontuberculous mycobacteria (M. avium My 330 / 88, M. kansasii My 235 / 88 and M. kansasii My 6509 / 96), their activities were comparable (≥ 2 µmol/l). Amides showed also a significant antimycobacterial activity, especially against M [...] . ...|$|R
