Words from then President Theodore Roosevelt goes: [...] "If we are to exert the slightest influence in Western Asia, it is of the highest importance {{that we have a}} naval station in Subic Bay." [...] Subic Bay is now on the rise of being one of the best training areas in the Corps.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2001, Congress has provided the Department of Defense (DOD) with {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars in supplemental and annual <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> military <b>operations</b> in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). DOD's reported annual costs for GWOT have shown a steady increase from about $ 0. 2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to about $ 98. 4 billion in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, Congress provided DOD with about $ 161. 8 billion in annual and supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> GWOT. To continue its GWOT operations, DOD has requested $ 141. 7 billion in <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> fiscal year 2008. The United States' commitments to GWOT will likely involve the continued investment of significant resources, requiring decision makers to consider difficult trade-offs as the nation faces an increasing long-range fiscal challenge. The magnitude of future costs will depend on several direct and indirect cost variables and, in some cases, decisions that have not yet been made. DOD's future costs will likely be affected by the pace and duration of operations, the types of facilities needed to support troops overseas, redeployment plans, and the amount of equipment to be repaired or replaced. Future cost variables for other U. S. government agencies include the efforts to help form national and provincial governments and build management capacity as well as capable and loyal security forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Reconstruction activities to restore, sustain, and protect critical infrastructure will also impose costs. Also, healthcare costs will likely increase as more servicemembers require treatment from injuries and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. DOD compiles and reports monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to support GWOT in a monthly Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Report. DOD leadership uses this report, along with other information, to advise Congress on the costs of the war and to formulate future GWOT budget requests. DOD reports these obligations by appropriation, contingency operation, and military service or defense agency. The monthly cost reports are typically compiled in the 45 days after the end of the reporting month in which the obligations are incurred. DOD has prepared monthly reports on the obligations incurred for its involvement in GWOT since fiscal year 2001. Section 1221 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires us to submit quarterly updates to Congress on the costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom based on DOD's monthly Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Reports. This report, which responds to this requirement, contains our analysis of DOD's reported obligations <b>for</b> military <b>operations</b> in support of GWOT through April 2007. Specifically, we assessed (1) DOD's appropriations and reported obligations <b>for</b> military <b>operations</b> in support of GWOT to date and (2) DOD's fiscal year 2007 reported obligations for GWOT by military service and appropriation account. ...|$|R
