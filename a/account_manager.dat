40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the growing stream of organization research that explores the relationship between professional identities and gender. Our central question pertains to how <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> ‘do gender’ in constructing their professional identities. While account management has been considered a sales occupation with a strong masculine connotation, some indications towards ‘feminization’ have also been observed. Our analysis of 39 interviews with white women and men working as <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> in the Netherlands suggests that these <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> construct a ‘tough salesman’ identity and a ‘co-operative communicator’ identity. These identities have different gender connotations. The ‘co-operative communicator’ identity facilitates a critical dialogue with the – often implicit – masculinity in the ‘tough salesman’ identity norm. We reflect {{on the effects of}} these gender connotations both for <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> and for our practice as organization researchers who intend to deconstruct rather than reproduce gender stereotypes in our study of professional identities...|$|R
