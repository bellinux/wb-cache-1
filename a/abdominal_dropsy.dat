5000|$|Private John H. Duke {{was born}} ca. 1837. He was mustered into Confederate service on May 14, 1862, {{when he was}} enlisted as a private in Captain Smiths Company (Key West Avengers), 7th Regiment Florida Infantry by Major R. B. Thomas at Tampa, Florida, {{for a period of}} 3 years or the war. He was present on all rolls until his {{transfer}} to the C.S. Navy on August 5, 1862, to serve in CSS Chattahoochee as a seaman. He is documented as requesting pay on December 11, 1862, at Leon County, Florida, for the period June 30 to October 31, 1862. He attests that he was on sick furlough. He was recommended for discharge from military service by Acting Assistant Surgeon W. A. Lively at Fort Brooke, Tampa, Florida, on January 13, 1863. He was diagnosed with rheumatism and general debility, due to torpid liver, enlarged spleen, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy.</b> [...] There is no further record of service after this date.|$|E
30|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{has become}} a worldwide epidemic. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported {{that the number of}} adult diabetic patients worldwide is 366 million in November 2011, and it is predicted to increase to 552 million by 2030 [1]. DM is broadly classified into two categories, namely, type 1 and type 2 [2] in which about 90 – 95  % of diabetic patients suffer from type 2 DM [3]. Type 1 DM is due to inability of pancreas to produce insulin; therefore, patients with type 1 DM need regular insulin injection. Type 2 DM is caused by degradation of secreted insulin. This type of DM can be managed by diet control and consumption of various synthetic antidiabetic drugs [4]. Despite their efficacy, commercial antidiabetic drugs are often associated with some undesirable adverse side effects such as flatulence, diarrhea, <b>abdominal</b> pain, <b>dropsy,</b> drug-resistance, weight gain, and heart failure [5 – 8]. Besides, the synthetic drugs are expensive and have poor availability to many rural populations, particularly in developing countries [9]. As a result, the scientific investigation is increasing for the antidiabetic drugs from natural resources with minimal side effects and cheap.|$|R
40|$|Taxonomy of the motile {{species of}} the genus Aeromonas is briefly discussed. It is {{suggested}} that Aeromonas organisms, isolated from outbreaks of red mouth of trout, red sore of pike, infectious <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy</b> and hemorrhagic septicemia of warm water fish, and which show acid and gas in glucose broth, production of 2, 3 -butanediol hydrogen sulfide from motility sulfide medium, presence of cytochrome oxidase, and hydrolysis of starch, be designated as Aeromonas liquefaciens. These tests also serve to differentiate A. liquefaciens from fish-pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens and from enteric bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The recurrence, metastasis and multidrug resistance (MDR) in lung cancer are the tough problems worldwide. This {{study was to}} establish a novel chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell line with high metastasis potential for exploring the mechanism of reccurrence, development and MDR in lung cancer. Methods The cell came from the <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy</b> of a fifty-six years old female patient with lung adenocarcinoma and the tumor markers CA 125, CYFRA 21 - 1, CEA, NSE were detected to be higher secretion by radioimmunoassay in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy.</b> Tumorigenicity of immunodeficient mice was confirmed in 8 th passage. The cell growth curve was mapped. Analysis of chromosome karyotype was tested. The gene expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Results The tumorigenesis rate started at 8 th passage in 3 / 10 immunodeficient mice via subcutaneously and the fully tumorigenicity was at 11 th passage as well as later passages. Under the microscope, the cell showed oval-shap and adherence. The chromosome karyotype analysis of the cells was sub-triploid. Approximately 1 × 106 and 1. 5 × 106 cancerous cells were injected into left cardiac ventricle and tail vein of immunodeficient mice respectively. The results showed multiorgan metastasis in the mice after three-four weeks, including mandible, scapula, humerus, vertebral column, femur, rib and brain, liver, adrenal gland, pulmonary in the mice after inoculation. The bone metastasis rate was 100 % in the tumor bearing mice by bone scintigraphy and pathology. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to examined and compared with SPC-A- 1 lung adenocarcinoma, ESM 1, VEGF-C, IL- 6, IL- 8, AR genes were overexpressed. The novel cell was named CPA-Yang 2. Conclusion The characteristics of novel strain CPA-Yang 2 is a highly metastasis cell line of Chinese lung adenocarcinoma. It has stable traits, highly metastasis ability and maybe is a MDR lung cancerous cell line. Of course, it’s a good experimental model for lung cancer research...|$|E
40|$|Aeromonas spp. are {{ubiquitous}} {{inhabitants of}} aquatic ecosystems, and {{are increasingly being}} reported as important pathogens for aquatic and terrestrial animals, as well as humans. A common bacterial disease caused by A. veronii has appeared in cultured channel catfish producing symptoms of erythema, hemorrhages, skin ulcers and high mortality (˃ 30 %) in China, causing great economic loss. From 2007 to 2013, diseased channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, displaying symptoms of septicemia, ulceration, or <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy</b> were collected from Southwestern China. The goals {{of this study were}} to identify the bacterial strains isolated from diseased fish and to determine the susceptibility of the pathogenic strains to many currently available antimicrobial agents. 18 bacterial isolates were obtained from diseased fish. Based on phenotypic characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, all isolates were identified as A. veronii. These results indicate that the microbiological risk posed by A. veronii is considerable for channel catfish cultured in Southwestern China. Susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. All 18 A. veronii isolates were sensitive to florfenicol, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol, and were resistant to cefradine, clindamycin, midecamycin, penbritin, and amoxicillin. There were sensitivity diversities of the 18 A. veronii isolates to other test antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole, deoxycycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, and more. This in vitro study provides enough data to recommend the use of these antibiotics for treating infectious diseases caused by A. veronii...|$|E
40|$|The {{main subject}} of this article, Nicolaus Witte von Lilienau (1618 – 1688), a native of Riga was the city’s {{municipal}} physician in 1652 – 1688. His studies at university proceeded during the 1640 s in Netherlands, particularly at Leiden but also at Utrecht and Franeker. The universities of Leiden and Utrecht, in particular, developed at that time into strongholds for the supporters of Harvey’s theory of blood circulation and the philosophy of Descartes, from where those supporters spread the ideas that gradually found acceptance elsewhere as well. Witte was fortunate to have a closeup view of the fierce opposition between supporters and opponents of the philosophy of Descartes. Witte defended three disputations, two of which exercitii causa. The first was at Leiden on <b>abdominal</b> <b>dropsy</b> in 1645, the second was at Franeker on arthritis in 1647. He defended his doctoral dissertation on the plague at Leiden in 1648. Witte’s views on physiology were pioneering {{in all of his}} disputations. Under the apparent influence of his teacher Johannes Walaeus, Witte considered the teaching of blood circulation to be self-evident. Blood circulation was not the specific object of his research but used in interpreting the internal causes of illnesses. Witte’s choice of sides was his dedication of his disputation of 1645 to Descartes and his closest friends and public supporters. This was a very bold move, considering the conditions of those times. Yet this probably did not derive so much from Witte’s passion for Cartesian philosophy but rather from the fact that all those individuals were at the same time also supporters of the theory of blood circulation. Witte had negative attitude towards authorities considered to be infallible, whether they be authors from antiquity or more recent authors. Thus he distanced himself from the supporters of both Galen and Paracelsus, considering them rival sects. Witte distanced himself in his disputations from both Galen’s teaching of four bodily fluids, which was still widely accepted at that time, and the teaching of the movement of blood and of the liver as the centre for producing blood. Witte also denied the concepts of iatroastrology, iatromagic and iatrotheology associated primarily with the teachings of Paracelsus. Yet he did espouse the principle of three elements. And the learning of chemiatry...|$|E
