500|$|Dark Horse Comics {{approached}} {{creative director}} Neil Druckmann, {{who was working}} on The Last of Us, to produce a tie-in comic book series for the game. Druckmann was initially wary of the idea, but eventually agreed when he realized Dark Horse [...] "didn't {{want to do something}} tangential" [...] with the opportunity of expanding their characters and universe beyond the game. Work on the comic began during the game's development, which allowed the stories of the two projects to integrate, and influence each other. Druckmann requested webcomic artist Faith Erin Hicks as a collaborator on the project, after reading her comic Friends with Boys (2012) and appreciating [...] "how personal it felt". He also felt that Hicks could capture the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the game. Hicks then sent some concept art to Dark Horse as a pitch for the job; they accepted, and she became officially involved with the project. Hicks was drawn to the project after reading about the character of Ellie in the game's script; she considered Ellie an unusual character to include in a survival horror game, calling her a [...] "tough teenage girl who wasn't sexualized, and who seemed very much the equal of her male counterpart". Hicks was given access to various gameplay sequences and the game's script during development, to allow her to better understand the story. She was also given videos of the actors performing on set, which was helpful when illustrating the characters. [...] "I get <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> characters and I see them interacting as human beings, not just as concept art," [...] said Hicks.|$|E

I have not much stomach for war, but the poetry of the fact I have stated made a very potent appeal to me on my literary side, and I did not hold out against it longer than to let the St. Louis get away with Cervera to Annapolis, when only her less dignified captives remained {{with those of the}} Harvard to feed either the vainglory or the pensive curiosity of the spectator.

Foucault takes <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> general practices through looking at the economic practices involved from the 18th century (where Mercantilism was at its peak) where a coherence strategy established an intelligible mechanism which provided a coherent link, together these different practices and their effects, and consequently allows one to judge all these practices as good or bad, not in terms of a law or moral principle, but in terms of propositions subject to the false dichotomy between true and false. Governments, Foucault noticed, were compelled to enter this competitive environment, by doing so entering into new regimes of truth with the fundamental effect of reconfiguring all the questions formally beset by the art of government.|$|E

It was first {{excavated}} in 1969 with different ancient items including architectural and decorative findings, ranging from a mosque, caravanserai, and residential houses to glazed pottery jars and plate ware, bronze coins, glass and stone artifacts.This affluent suburb to the south of Dubai city is the location of an important archaeological site dating to the early Islamic period. Large houses built of beach rock (farush) covered with lime plaster have been excavated at Jumeirah by a team from the Dubai Museum. Based on a study of the pottery found at the site, Jumeirah seems to date to the first two or three centuries of the Islamic era. Thus, it is in part contemporary with the sequence at Kush in northern Ras al-Khaimah, and with Jazirat al-Hulaylah. Jumeirah is, however, the only complete settlement with well-preserved architecture yet excavated from this important period. A selection of the finds from Jumeirah {{can be seen in the}} Dubai Museum.This is one of the most significant archaeological sites in the UAE, but there’s so little left to see that it’s really only of interest to folks with more than a passing interest in the remote past. With origins in the 6th century AD, the settlement was once a caravan stop on a route linking Iraq and Oman and is interesting in that it spans the pre-Islamic and Islamic eras. Pottery, tools, coins and other items unearthed here are displayed at Dubai Museum and the Heritage Village [...]The ancient trade route between Iraq and Northern Oman, Jumeirah was a station for camels and horses along with these routes. Rich population are found at the suburban region south of Dubai. Old archaeological remains from 7th to 15th century A.D. where found during the mining in 1968. These remains where found out to be the existence of houses, stores and souks. Among these houses one was found to be the Palace of one ruler of that period in this region. The modern Islamic civilizations during this period are Kush in northern Ras Al-Khaimah, and Jazirat al-Hulaylah.Metal armoury, domestic equipment in stone, remains of dwellings, beach rock farush and lime plaster all these materials are used to build the houses, other things are hunting tools, coins, pottery and other household remains. All these were sent to Dubai Museum and Heritage and Diving Village, Shindagha so that tourists can have <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> ancient and historic things.Jumeirah Archaeological site reflects a picture of existence of Islamic era. Apart from gaining information about the culture and civilization of Dubai this site also amuses many of the researchers, archaeologists and international tourists which make this site a point of entertainment.This Jumeirah Archaeological site is generally not opened for public due to protect these important reserves of archaeological knowledge. Dubai museum will grant on special request to visit the site if you are a tourists or even if you are an archaeology student.|$|E
