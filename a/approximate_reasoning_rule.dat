40|$|LinguisticBelief is a Java {{computer}} code that evaluates combinations of linguistic variables using an <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>rule</b> base. Each variable {{is comprised of}} fuzzy sets, and a rule base describes the reasoning on combinations of variables fuzzy sets. Uncertainty is considered and propagated through the rule base using the belief/plausibility measure. The mathematics of fuzzy sets, approximate reasoning, and belief/ plausibility are complex. Without an automated tool, this complexity precludes their application to all but the simplest of problems. LinguisticBelief automates {{the use of these}} techniques, allowing complex problems to be evaluated easily. LinguisticBelief can be used free of charge on any Windows XP machine.

40|$|Risk from {{an act of}} {{terrorism}} is a combination of the likelihood of an attack, the likelihood of success of the attack, and the consequences of the attack. The considerable epistemic uncertainty in each of these three factors can be addressed using the belief/plausibility measure of uncertainty from the Dempster/Shafer theory of evidence. The adversary determines the likelihood of the attack. The success of the attack and the consequences of the attack are determined by the security system and mitigation measures put in place by the defender. This report documents a process for evaluating risk of terrorist acts using an adversary/defender model with belief/plausibility as the measure of uncertainty. Also, the adversary model is a linguistic model that applies belief/plausibility to fuzzy sets used in an <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>rule</b> base...|$|E
40|$|In 2005, a {{group of}} {{international}} decision makers developed a manual process for evaluating terrorist scenarios. That process has been implemented in the approximate reasoning Java software tool, LinguisticBelief, released in FY 2007. One purpose of this report is to show {{the flexibility of the}} LinguisticBelief tool to automate a custom model developed by others. LinguisticBelief evaluates combinations of linguistic variables using an <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>rule</b> base. Each variable is comprised of fuzzy sets, and a rule base describes the reasoning on combinations of variables fuzzy sets. Uncertainty is considered and propagated through the rule base using the belief/plausibility measure. This report documents the evaluation and rank-ordering of several example terrorist scenarios for the existing process implemented in our software. LinguisticBelief captures and propagates uncertainty and allows easy development of an expanded, more detailed evaluation, neither of which is feasible using a manual evaluation process. In conclusion, the Linguistic-Belief tool is able to (1) automate an expert-generated reasoning process for the evaluation of the risk of terrorist scenarios, including uncertainty, and (2) quickly evaluate and rank-order scenarios of concern using that process...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{techniques that}} use possibility theory {{to estimate the}} risk of terrorist acts. These techniques were developed under the sponsorship of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{as part of the}} National Infrastructure Simulation Analysis Center (NISAC) project. The techniques have been used to estimate the risk of various terrorist scenarios to support NISAC analyses during 2004. The techniques are based on the Logic Evolved Decision (LED) methodology developed {{over the past few years}} by Terry Bott and Steve Eisenhawer at LANL. [LED] The LED methodology involves the use of fuzzy sets, possibility theory, and <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning.</b> LED captures the uncertainty due to vagueness and imprecision that is inherent in the fidelity of the information available for terrorist acts; probability theory cannot capture these uncertainties. This report does not address the philosophy supporting the development of nonprobabilistic approaches, and it does not discuss possibility theory in detail. The references provide a detailed discussion of these subjects. [Shafer] [Klir and Yuan] [Dubois and Prade] Suffice to say that these approaches were developed to address types of uncertainty that cannot be addressed by a probability measure. An earlier report discussed in detail the problems with using a probability measure to evaluate terrorist risk. [Darby Methodology]. Two related techniques are discussed in this report: (1) a numerical technique, and (2) a linguistic technique. The numerical technique uses traditional possibility theory applied to crisp sets, while the linguistic technique applies possibility theory to fuzzy sets. Both of these techniques as applied to terrorist risk for NISAC applications are implemented in software called PossibleRisk. The techniques implemented in PossibleRisk were developed specifically for use in estimating terrorist risk for the NISAC program. The LEDTools code can be used to perform the same linguistic evaluation as performed in PossibleRisk. [LEDTools] LEDTools is a general purpose linguistic evaluation tool and allows user defined universes of discourse and <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>rules,</b> whereas PossibleRisk uses predefined universes of discourse (risk, attack, success, loss, and consequence) and rules. Also LEDTools has the capability to model a large number of threat scenarios with a graph and to integrate the scenarios (paths from the graph) into the linguistic evaluation. Example uses of PossibleRisk and LEDTools for the possibilistic evaluation of terrorist risk are provided in this report...|$|R

The navigation aid tool builds on the competence graph and the student model, which includes the elements of uncertainty in the assessment of students. An individualized navigation graph is constructed for each student, suggesting the competences the student is more prepared to study. We use fuzzy set theory for dealing with uncertainty. The marks of the assessment tests are transformed into linguistic terms and used for assigning values to linguistic variables. For each competence, the level of difficulty and the level of knowing its prerequisites are calculated based on the assessment marks. Using these linguistic variables and <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> (fuzzy IF-THEN <b>rules),</b> a crisp category is assigned to each competence regarding its level of recommendation...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of papers have been devoted to point out which {{combinations}} of the several fuzzy implication, composition and aggregation operators are necessary to satisfy a natural requirement for meaningful reasoning, that is, given a system observation which matches the antecedent of a rule, {{the conclusion of the}} inference process matches the consequent of that rule. Nevertheless, only few of these papers have analysed, once fixed a combination, which constraints on the reciprocal position of input and output fuzzy sets should be satisfied. In this paper, we consider fuzzy implication operators which are extensions of the two-valued logic implication operator and are non-decreasing with respect to their second argument, generic Sup-T composition operators, and minimum as aggregation operator. First, we analyse some features (namely, uniform level of indetermination, perfect matching with the consequent of a rule, and complete indetermination) of the conclusions inferred by those fuzzy implication operators with regard to fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> with one <b>rule.</b> Then, as regards <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> with multiple <b>rules,</b> we demonstrate that, if the fundamental requirement for fuzzy reasoning is satisfied, then the fuzzy sets which partition the input and output universes have to meet appropriate constraints.

However, the next generation of expert systems should have an environment which contain a choice of several mathematical algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning.</b> To meet the need for validatable and verifiable coding, the expert system environment must no longer depend upon ad hoc reasoning techniques but instead must include mathematically rigorous techniques for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Popular <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> techniques are reviewed, including: certainty factors, belief measures, Bayesian probabilities, fuzzy logic, and Shafer-Dempster techniques for reasoning. A group of mathematically rigorous algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> are focused on that could form the basis of a next generation expert system environment. These algorithms are based upon the axioms of set theory and probability theory. To separate these algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> various conditions of mutual exclusivity and independence are imposed upon the assertions. <b>Approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> algorithms presented include: reasoning with statistically independent assertions, reasoning with mutually exclusive assertions, reasoning with assertions that exhibit minimum overlay within the state space, reasoning with assertions that exhibit maximum overlay within the state space (i. e. fuzzy logic), pessimistic reasoning (i. e. worst case analysis), optimistic reasoning (i. e. best case analysis), and reasoning with assertions with absolutely no knowledge of the possible dependency among the assertions. A robust environment for expert system construction should include the two modes of inference: modus ponens and modus tollens. Modus ponens inference is based upon reasoning towards the conclusion in a statement of logical implication, whereas modus tollens inference is based upon reasoning away from the conclusion.
