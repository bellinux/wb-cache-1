5|$|From the 1860s through 1871, early {{forms of}} the {{periodic}} table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> molybdenum (element42) and ruthenium (element44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name ekamanganese (from eka-, the Sanskrit word for one) because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E

The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32.

Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut.

The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to be made by the French to the south.|$|E
5|$|Mahanoy Creek enters Northumberland County in East Cameron Township. It flows westward for {{a number}} of miles through a valley with Line Mountain to the south and Mahanoy Mountain to the north. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 125 in this valley. The creek passes into West Cameron Township, flowing west and goes through the {{township}} for several miles. It then flows into Little Mahanoy Township. After a short distance, it leaves behind the Line Mountain/Mahanoy Mountain valley and picks up Zerbe Run. Mahanoy Creek then turns southwest and passes by Dornsife before cutting through <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> Little Mountain and Line Mountain and exiting Little Mahanoy Township. At this point, the creek enters Jackson Township and picks up Schwaben Creek, its last tributary, after some distance.

5|$|Originally {{named the}} Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, {{and later the}} Newaygo and Northport State Road, today's modern highway {{can be traced back}} to the 19th century and earlier. The southernmost section between Grand Rapids and Battle Creek {{parallels}} an early Indian trail. The modern highway was formed by July 1, 1919 along this segment. By the 1940s, a second section of highway was designated M-37, creating <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> it and the original section. This gap was eliminated in the 1950s, completing the M-37 corridor in the state. Additional changes to the routing were made through the Grand Rapids area into the 1970s.|$|E
