Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to the <b>balance</b> wheel around 1657 by Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens greatly increased the accuracy of portable timepieces, transforming early pocketwatches from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers. Improvements to the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time. Modern <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> are made of special low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the mainspring runs down. Before the 1980s, balance wheels and <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic quartz timekeeping technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> is in mechanical watches.|$|R
5000|$|Early watchmakers empirically found {{approaches}} {{to make their}} <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> isochronous. For example, John Arnold in 1776 patented a helical (cylindrical) form of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> in which {{the ends of the}} spring were coiled inwards. In 1861 M. Phillips published a theoretical treatment of the problem. [...] He demonstrated that a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> whose center of gravity coincides with the axis of the balance wheel is isochronous.|$|R

25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{is a fine}} spiral or helical {{torsion spring}} used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the balance wheel. The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> is an essential adjunct to the balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>balance</b> wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> was added, a major {{remaining}} {{source of}} inaccuracy was {{the effect of}} temperature changes.

50|$|An {{increase}} in temperature increases {{the dimensions of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance</b> due to thermal expansion. The strength of a spring, the restoring force it produces in response to a deflection, is proportional to its breadth and the cube of its thickness, and inversely proportional to its length. An {{increase in}} temperature would actually make a spring stronger if it affected only its physical dimensions. However, a much larger effect in a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made of plain steel is that the elasticity of the spring's metal decreases significantly as the temperature increases, the net effect being that a plain steel spring becomes weaker with increasing temperature. An increase in temperature also increases diameter of a steel or brass balance wheel, increasing its rotational inertia, its moment of inertia, making it harder for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to accelerate. The two effects of increasing temperature on physical dimensions of the <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance,</b> the strengthening of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the increase in rotational inertia of the balance, have opposing effects and to an extent cancel each other. The major effect of temperature which affects the rate of a watch is the weakening of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> with increasing temperature.|$|R

500|$|The {{invention}} of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made the <b>balance</b> wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|R
5000|$|There is some dispute as {{to whether}} it was invented around 1660 by British {{physicist}} Robert Hooke or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, with the likelihood being that Hooke first had the idea, but Huygens built the first functioning watch that used a <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> [...] Before that time, balance wheels or foliots without springs were used in clocks and watches, but they were very sensitive to fluctuations in the driving force, causing the timepiece to slow down as the mainspring unwound. The introduction of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> effected an enormous increase in the accuracy of pocketwatches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10 minutes per day, making them useful timekeepers for the first time. The first <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> had only a few turns.|$|R
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve.

5000|$|Due to his {{relationship}} with the scientist Robert Hooke he made some of the first watches with <b>balance</b> <b>springs,</b> these had the potential to be much more accurate than earlier watches. Several different kinds were experimented with, including an early type with double balances geared together in order to eliminate errors of motion. One of these was made for King Charles II and was signed [...] "Robert Hooke invent. 1658. T. Tompion fecit, 1675". William Derham mentions this in his book The Artificial Clockmaker. This watch, it seems, has not survived. The final form of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> arrangement used by Tompion was a plain spiral with a single balance, indeed the same arrangement employed by Christiaan Huygens in watches made for him by Thuret. A few of Tompion's early spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> movements were also of a similar specification to the Huygens/Thuret pattern as they had a standing barrel and no fusee. Huygens imagined that the latter would not be necessary as the spiral spring would render the balance isochronous. Tompion must have soon found this rather optimistic surmise was however incorrect, as all Tompion's subsequent spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> movements have fusees, and this design became the standard pattern in English watches throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
25|$|Hooke {{developed}} the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> independently of {{and at least}} 5 years before Christiaan Huygens, who published his own work in Journal de Scavans in February 1675.|$|R
50|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> or {{hairspring}} {{in mechanical}} watches is a fine, spiral-shaped torsion spring that pushes the balance wheel back toward its center position as it rotates back and forth.

50|$|It {{is often}} stated that Tompion invented the {{particular}} type of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> regulation in pocket watches widely used until the late 19th century. This has the curb pins mounted on a sector rack, and moved by a pinion on which is mounted a graduated and numbered disc. While this system was used by Tompion, many refer to it incorrectly as the 'Tompion regulator'. However, he certainly did not invent this system, as such regulating devices were already in use by the 1670s on French <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> watches of the Thuret pattern.|$|R

25|$|During {{the same}} period, between 1779 and 1782, Arnold {{finalized}} {{the form of}} his chronometer watches. Through continuous experimentation, he worked {{out a way to}} make an effective but simple form of compensation balance. At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> that let develop concentrically and, also, confer the property of isochronism on the oscillating balance. Not only this, but adjustments to the compensation balance and the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> could be carried out in a simple, calculated way. These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.|$|R
50|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> obeys Hooke's Law: the {{restoring}} torque {{is proportional to}} the angular displacement. When this property is exactly satisfied, the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> is said to be isochronous, and the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude of oscillation. This is an essential property for accurate timekeeping, because no mechanical drive train can provide absolutely constant driving force. This is particularly true in watches and portable clocks which are powered by a mainspring, which provides a diminishing drive force as it unwinds. Another cause of varying driving force is friction, which varies as the lubricating oil ages.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bimetallic}} compensated {{balance wheel}} was made obsolete {{in the early}} 20th century by advances in metallurgy.
