5|$|Although the sawmills and {{the flour}} mills <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> Minneapolis remains a {{regional}} center in banking and industry. The two largest milling companies, General Mills and the Pillsbury Company, now merged under the General Mills name, still remain {{prominent in the}} Twin Cities area. The city has rediscovered the riverfront, which now hosts parkland, the Mill City Museum, and the Guthrie Theater.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the street}} was mainly {{inhabited}} by merchants and craftspeople. Although they <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent {{is one of the}} favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May.|$|E
5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E

25|$|Mechanisation around 1900 greatly {{diminished the}} number of workers {{required}} to operate the county's relatively large farms, and the proportion of workers in the agricultural sector dropped substantially during this period. Several major engineering companies developed in Lincoln, Gainsborough and Grantham to support those changes, perhaps most famously Fosters of Lincoln, who built the first tank, and Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham. Most such companies <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> and Lincolnshire is no longer an engineering centre.|$|E
25|$|Since end of {{the twentieth}} century, many artists and local historians have mourned the fact that the bohemian days of Greenwich Village <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> because of the {{extraordinarily}} high housing costs in the neighborhood. The artists fled to other New York City neighborhoods including SoHo, Tribeca, Dumbo Williamsburg, and Long Island City.

500|$|Though the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway's streetcars <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> from Charlottesville, {{public transit}} is still of {{interest}} to the city. [...] Since the rise of the personal automobile, Charlottesville has struggled to provide an effective public transportation system. [...] Although bus service has been implemented under Charlottesville Area Transit, the city is challenged by expanding development and the lack of consumer willingness to use public transportation. [...] In the early 2000s, the city began planning and analyzing various methods of public transportation for implementation within Charlottesville, one of which includes the development of a streetcar system. [...] A 2005 study entitled Shaping Community with Transit laid out plans {{for the development of a}} streetcar system that would operate along West Main Street from the University of Virginia to downtown Charlottesville, following much of the same path as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway. [...] A Streetcar Task Force was created in December 2006 by the City Council to examine the feasibility of a streetcar system, though no concrete plans have been developed or implemented as of 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} {{one of the}} grandest rooms in the house, the Library. The room was {{formerly known as the}} Great Chamber; in a 16th-century mansion, such as Montacute, this room was the epicentre of all ceremony and state: hence, its position {{at the head of the}} principal staircase, making it the finale of a processional route. Here, the most important guests would have been received, and where the Phelips dined formally with their guests and where musical entertainments and dancing would take place. The Great Chamber at Montacute contains the finest chimney-piece in the house; however, its classical statuary depicting nudes <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> victims of Victorian prudery. During the 18th century the room was shut up and used a store and permitted to decay; this explains why in the 19th century it was completely restored in [...] "Elizabethan style." [...] The strapwork ceiling, panelling and bookcases all date from this period. The only original features remaining are the heraldic stained glass in the windows and the Portland stone chimney-piece. The room contains an ornate carved wooden porch; installed in the library in the 1830s, it was originally in the parlour below.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Culbertson {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{settlers}} to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson's Path. He built a sawmill on the mouth of the creek so after moving to the area and there he lived for several years. Culbertson was forced to flee the area during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the [...] "Big Runaway" [...] occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the [...] "Little Runaway". Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a press that extracted nut and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible by canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertonson's Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain to be ground into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson's Mill and tavern <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods.|$|E
