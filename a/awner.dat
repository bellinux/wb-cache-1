30|$|Both an 1 and an 2 {{genes in}} all 15 accessions tested are loss-of-function. Yet, <b>awn</b> length in these accessions varies {{from zero to}} about 5  cm. This {{indicates}} that more genes are controlling the presence/absence of an <b>awn</b> {{as well as its}} length. Wild rice, including Oryza rufipogon, usually has an extra-long <b>awn,</b> much longer than 10  cm; the <b>awn</b> moreover is barbed in wild rice. In contrast, the <b>awns</b> of all aboriginal landraces are barbless. It was noted earlier that loss-of-function an 2 gene leads to a short and barbless <b>awn</b> or to no <b>awn</b> at all (Gu et al. 2015; Hua et al., 2015). Cai and Morishima (2002) showed that <b>awn</b> length in rice is a QTL-controlled trait with more than 10 loci. In addition to An 1 and An 2 used in the current study, Regulator of <b>Awn</b> Elongation 1 (RAE 1), RAE 2, and RAE 3 were shown to contribute to <b>awn</b> length control (Furuta et al. 2015; Bessho-Uehara et al. 2016). Thus, other awn-controlling genes should be responsible for the differences in <b>awn</b> length among Formosan landraces.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} and species rich grass genera Aristida Linnaeus (1753 : 82; Aristidoideae) and Stipa Linnaeus (1753 : 78; Stipeae) are ordinarily simple to distinguish by the characteristic three <b>awns</b> in Aristida {{and a single}} <b>awn</b> in Stipa. A study of Aristida in Madagascar shows that the Madagascar endemic Stipa perrieri A. Camus (1934 : 593) {{is in fact a}} 1 -awned variant of Aristida tenuissima Camus (1933 : 844) described and illustrated by Bosser (1969). There are no collections of Stipa or other members of Stipeae recorded from Madagascar. Aristida tenuissima is a morphologically variable species in both habit and <b>awn</b> structure. The full range of variability within A. tenuissima is described and presented graphically in Figure 1, with the distribution presented in Figure 2, expanding Bosser’s (1969) description and distribution statement. Most collections have single geniculate <b>awns,</b> while the larger plants {{are more likely to have}} three <b>awns.</b> The combination of a twisted <b>awn</b> column and the lack of articulation in the <b>awn</b> distinguish this species from all other Aristida in Madagascar. Both Aristida and Stipa are plants of open arid areas with a single fusiform hardened and <b>awned</b> fertile floret and a pointed callus in every spikelet and were historically placed together in the tribe Stipeae (de Winter 1965). This similarity is superficial and does not reflect common origin. Aristida is a member of the Aristidoideae within the PACMAD clade (Barker et al. 1995, Grass Phylogeny Working Group 2001) and differs from Stipa by its C 4 photosynthetic system, two sheaths around each vascular bundle, the presence of epidermal microhairs and embryo characters, as well as the presence of three <b>awns.</b> The three <b>awns</b> of Aristida are remarkably morphologically plastic in their lengths, relative lengths, orientation, fusion, twisting an...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{interfacial}} area (<b>awn)</b> between air and subsurface liquids during air-sparging can limit {{the rate of}} site remediation. Lateral movement within porous media could be encountered during air-sparging operations when air moves {{along the bottom of}} a low-permeability lens. This study was conducted to directly measure the amount of <b>awn</b> between air and water flowing within a bench-scale porous flow cell during the lateral movement of air along the upper edge of the cell during air injections into an initially water-saturated flow cell. Four different cell orientations were used to evaluate the effect of air injection rates and porous media geometries on the amount of <b>awn</b> between fluids. Air was injected at flow rates that varied by three orders of magnitude, and for each flow cellover this range of injection rates little change in <b>awn</b> was noted. A wider variation in <b>awn</b> was observed when air moved through different regions for the different flow cell orientations. These results are in good agreement with the experimental findings of Waduge et al. (2007), who performed experiments in a larger sand-pack flow cell, and determined that air-sparging efficiency is nearly independent of flow rate but highly dependent on the porous structure. By directly measuring the <b>awn,</b> and showing that <b>awn</b> does not vary greatly with changes in injection rate, we show that the lack of improvement to remediation rates is because there is a weak dependence of the <b>awn</b> on the air injection rate...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis We {{present the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of the mechanics of self-burial of some plant seeds whose morphologies respond to environmental changes in humidity. The seeds of Erodium and Pelargonium have hygroscopically responsive <b>awns</b> that {{play a critical role in}} their self-burial into soil. The <b>awn,</b> coiled in a dry state, uncoils to stretch linearly under highly humid condition because of a tilted arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in one of the layers of the awn’s bilayered structure. By measuring the mechanical characteristics of the <b>awns</b> of Pelargonium carnosum, we find that the extensional force of the <b>awn</b> can be aptly modeled by the theory of elasticity for a coiled spring. We further show that although the resistance to the seed-head penetrating relatively coarse soils without spinning is large enough to block the digging seed, the rotation of the seed greatly reduces the soil’s resistance down to a level the <b>awn</b> can easily overcome. Our mechanical analysis reveals that the self-burial of the seed is a sophisticated outcome of the helically coiled configuration of the <b>awn...</b>|$|R

40|$|Trachypogon spicatus, {{formerly}} known as Trachypogon plumosus, is a dominant grass in some savannas of Northern South America. Its dispersal unit, like many other species of the Andropogoneae tribe, bears a hygroscopic <b>awn</b> which facilitates its establishment in favorable microsites. Some authors have previously proposed {{that there is a}} positive correlation between <b>awn</b> length and dispersal unit burial, and that this relationship increases the probability of seed survival {{in the event of a}} fire, since soil acts as insulator. In this study we experimentally tested this relationship for T. spicatus. A total of 192 diaspores were placed in randomized blocks, in aluminum trays filled with soil under greenhouse conditions. Diaspores were sprayed with water daily for a month to guarantee <b>awn</b> movement; on the last day of the experiment, they were sprayed with red aerosol paint to determine burial depth. The effects of <b>awn</b> length, presence of caryopses, and presence of a pivot for the passive segment of the <b>awn</b> on diaspore burial were evaluated. Germination viability was tested using a tetrazolium salt test for 35 caryopses. No significant differences in diaspore burial were observed between diaspores with and without caryopses (F(2, 126) = 0. 034, p= 0. 853). A positive correlation between <b>awn</b> length and diaspore burial was observed only if the passive <b>awn</b> lacked a pivot (r(66) = 0. 394, p< 0. 05). Diaspores whose <b>awns</b> had a pivot point achieved significantly deeper burial distances than their counterparts (F(2, 126) = 7. 063, p= 0. 005). Viability test found that 0 % of caryopses tested were able to germinate; this is possibly due to the time difference between sampling and testing. We considered the presence or absence of caryopsis as an important factor, since previous studies have not yet considered it and the high production of sterile diaspores in grasses. These results suggest that the physical mechanism behind T. spicatus diaspore burial is <b>awn</b> torque. This would explain why our results partially support the hypothesis previously proposed by other authors regarding the effect of <b>awn</b> length upon dispersal unit burial, but would also account for the differences observed in burial depth between diaspores with an available pivot point for the passive <b>awn</b> and diaspores lacking thereof.
