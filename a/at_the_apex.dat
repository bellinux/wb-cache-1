5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex),</b> and contain red pigment granules.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a light microscope, they are elliptical, with smooth walls and {{dimensions}} of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5µm. The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes the pigment to form globules. Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|First {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 along a different routing, M-47 was extended {{several times in}} both directions through the 1920s and 1930s. Two of these extensions replaced sections of M-111 in the Bay City area. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of its length in the 1950s, M-47 stretched from Webberville {{in the south to}} Bay City State Park in the north. Since Interstate 75 (I-75) opened in the Tri-Cities area, the northern section of M-47 was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways. The southern end was moved after I-96 opened in the Lansing area. Further changes into the 1970s shortened M-47 more, producing the routing in use today.|$|E
5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was {{faced with the prospect}} of a period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule the country in the interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of Brazil's government.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata has {{thin-walled}} cheilocystidia, {{which are}} clavate (club-shaped), lack encrustation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex,</b> and are colourless. The basidia are also clavate, {{and can be}} two-, three- or four-spored, and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres (μm) by 5 to 9μm. The sterigmata (the narrow horns {{on the end of}} the basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm long. It lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, and measure from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm. The hyphae can have clamp connections, but can also lack them.|$|E

5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads {{to the tip of}} the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E

She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably {{the case in the}} work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 {{for the city of}} Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis {{occurs in}} two disjunct ranges in {{southern}} Australia. In southwest Western Australia, {{it has been}} recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance.

It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of Wyperfeld National Park and subalpine areas of Mount Buffalo National Park, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from Norfolk Island. In 2012, it was reported for the first time from Kerala, India, where it was discovered growing on a coconut tree stump.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E
