50|$|<b>Argillipedoturbation,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as self-mulching, is a process of soil mixing caused by the shrinking and swelling of the smectite clays contained in the soil. It is an effect specific to soils of the vertisolic variety, and is triggered by the constant cycles of wetting and drying It is characterized by 1 cm wide, 50 cm deep vertical cracks in the solum that contain differing materials {{from the rest of the}} soil layer they are found in, as well as sloughed-in surface materials. In order for <b>argillipedoturbation</b> to occur, the soil must be at least 30% clay content. The expression of <b>argillipedoturbation</b> depends to a large degree on the exact clay content of the soil, as well as on what other minerals make up the soil composition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Argillipedoturbation</b> can {{be strong}} enough that it can affect the soil horizons by {{combining}} the different horizons, making them difficult to distinguish. It can also result in a gently-rolling surface referred to as gilgai topography and in the dramatic soil inclusions known as slickensides. In addition, <b>argillipedoturbation</b> sometimes results in a chernozemic-like A-type horizon, or one resembling a gleysolic order soil. This process can also affect the distribution of rock fragments, by moving fragments at the surface to lower soil layers and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Although, in {{semi-arid}} environments, rock fragments at {{the soil}} surface and within the topsoil {{play an important role}} in desertification control, little is known about their spatial distribution. Therefore, this study analyses spatial patterns of rock fragment cover along catenas, and the vertical variations in volumetric rock fragment content in soil profiles in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Natural and anthropogenic processes inducing these patterns are assessed. Volumetric rock fragment content (R-V) was analysed in 10 soil pits. All rock fragments were extracted, and their volumes determined by pedo-stratigraphic unit, size and lithology. The rock fragment cover (R-C) was determined by the point-count method using vertical photographs of {{the soil surface}}. The following processes contribute to the vertical variability of R-V: (1) in Vertisols, upsqueezing as a consequence of swell-shrink cycles (<b>argillipedoturbation)</b> is responsible for high R-C at the soil surface; (2) large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) are rapidly brought to the soil surface by kinetic sieving through tillage, even in the case of continuous fine sediment deposition, what may result in a rock fragment rich subsoil, underlying a thick soil layer (up to 80 cm) without large rock fragments and a topsoil with a high R-C at the surface; (3) Skeletic Regosols at the foot of cliffs show no systematic vertical rock fragment distributions. As to rock fragment cover along the catena, some fundamental differences appear between the basalt and limestone substrate. On the basalt catena with slope gradients between 0. 06 and 0. 42 m m(- 1), R-C is high everywhere (57 - 85 %) and is unrelated to slope gradient. Vertical processes such as kinetic sieving through ploughing and <b>argillipedoturbation</b> determine the rock fragment distribution at the soil surface. In limestone areas, <b>argillipedoturbation</b> is less active and R-C is positively correlated with slope gradient (R- 2 = 0. 74; n = 6; P 2 cm) and more kinetic sieving sensitive rock fragments lowers R- 2 to 0. 46 (n = 6; n. s.). Preconditions for the present spatial distribution of rock fragments at the soil surface in the study area are the occurrence of two geomorphic processes in the past: (1) mudflows depositing diamictons including much coarse debris and (2) intense water erosion, which occurred after deforestation and exposed rock fragments at or near to the soil surface. Generally, the balance between lateral and vertical movements of rock fragments now, controls the spatial distribution of R-C. With respect to the lateral displacement processes: (1) lateral transport over the soil surface by trampling, tillage and concentrated runoff, especially on steep slopes, and (2) rockfall from the cliffs. Vertical supply of rock fragments to the soil surface is caused by (1) selective runoff erosion and the development of erosion pavements, (2) tillage induced kinetic sieving, bringing preferentially large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) to the soil surface, and (3) <b>argillipedoturbation</b> in Vertisol areas.

40|$|Distinct rock {{fragment}} displacements {{occur on}} the ambas, or structurally determined stepped mountains of the Northern Ethiopian Highlands. This paper describes the rock fragment detachment from cliffs by rockfall, quantifies its annual rate, and identifies factors controlling rock fragment movement on the scree slopes. It further presents a conceptual model explaining rock fragment cover at the soil surface in these landscapes. In the May Zegzeg catchment (Dogu'a Tembien district, Tigray), rockfall from cliffs and rock fragment movement on debris slopes by runoff and livestock trampling were monitored over a 4 -year period (1998 - 2001). Rockfall and rock fragment transport mainly induced by livestock trampling appear to be important geomorphic processes. Along a 1500 -m long section of the Amba Aradam sandstone cliff, at least 80 t of rocks are detached yearly and fall over a mean vertical distance of 24 m resulting in a mean annual cliff retreat rate of 0. 37 mm y(- 1). Yearly unit rock fragment transport rates on scree slopes ranged between 23. 1 and 37. 9 kg m(- 1) y(- 1). This process is virtually stopped when exclosures are established. Corresponding mean rock fragment transport coefficients K are 32 - 69 kg m(- 1) y(- 1) on rangeland but only 3. 9 kg m(- 1) y(- 1) in densely vegetated exclosures. A conceptual model indicates that besides rockfall from cliffs and <b>argillipedoturbation,</b> all factors and processes of rock fragment redistribution {{in the study area}} are of anthropogenic origin.
