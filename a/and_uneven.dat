5|$|The {{collection}} saw graphical {{and musical}} revisions {{and is based}} on the international versions of both games, making certain content accessible to players outside of Japan for the first time. The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west, and has received positive reviews in western territories. Many praised the graphical upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms. The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> quality between the two, while some of the collection's added content drew mixed opinions. The minor upgrade faults <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> quality were fixed in the PlayStation 4 version.|$|E
5|$|The Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, {{along with}} the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix {{of plants and animals}} that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species. These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Jagiello's {{accession}} to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter {{like that of}} Kraków, modeled on the Magdeburg Law; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great. Władysław's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> at first but achieved a lasting influence. By {{the time of the}} Union of Lublin in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{transition}} from timber to stone keeps are unclear, and the process was slow <b>and</b> <b>uneven,</b> taking many years to take effect across the various regions. Traditionally {{it was believed that}} stone keeps had been adopted because of the cruder nature of wooden buildings, the limited lifespan of wooden fortifications and their vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents. Some wooden keeps were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen. Nonetheless, stone became increasingly popular as a building material for keeps for both military and symbolic reasons.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other courses}} in Oklahoma, Oak Tree {{is a very}} windy course and can often have winds of at least 30 miles per hour (48km/h).

25|$|Despite some {{positive}} critical notice, only after his best {{years as a}} writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame. Yet that neglect might stem from his novels' style: the crime novels are fast-moving and compelling but sometimes sloppy <b>and</b> <b>uneven.</b> Thompson wrote quickly (many novels were written in a month); using his newspaper experience he wrote concise, evocative prose with little editing.|$|E

25|$|Critics of the MDGs {{complained of}} a lack of {{analysis}} and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> progress, among others. Although developed countries' aid for achieving the MDGs rose during the challenge period, more than half went for debt relief and much of the remainder going towards natural disaster relief and military aid, rather than further development.|$|E
25|$|The National Rail {{network is}} mostly outside {{the control of}} Transport for London, and {{passenger}} services are run by number of independent rail companies. Because of this, acceptance of Oyster PAYG on National Rail services was subject to the policy of each individual company and the roll-out of PAYG was much slower than on TfL services. For the first six years of Oyster, rollout on National Rail was gradual <b>and</b> <b>uneven,</b> with validity limited to specific lines and stations.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{buildings}} on the island are the Power House and the Alster Tower; both {{are open to the}} public. The Power House was built to hold a generator to supply the island with power, and now is more of a museum of how electric power was obtained in the early 1900s, as well as a few stories of getting tools and equipment to Heart Island during the castle's construction. The Alster Tower was purposely constructed with slanting <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> walls, ceilings, and roofs.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of colored tinfoil to the pavilion (back) surfaces of gemstones was common practice during the Georgian and Victorian era; {{this was the}} first treatment—aside from cutting and polishing—applied to diamond. Foiled diamonds are mounted in closed-back jewelry settings, which may make their detection problematic. Under magnification, areas where the foil has flaked or lifted away are often seen; moisture that has entered between the stone and foil will also cause degradation <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> color. Because of its antique status, the presence of foiled diamonds in older jewelry will not detract from its value.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, {{with the exception}} of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the northwest that has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the {{territory is}} covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed <b>and</b> <b>uneven.</b>|$|E
25|$|The dwarf or {{cloud forest}} {{developed}} in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the cloud forest of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an even surface, but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking.|$|E
