5|$|Thunder Runs {{design was}} {{originally}} intended for Americana Amusement Park {{in the late}} 1980s; Dinn Corporation was contracted to manufacturer a wooden roller coaster designed by Curtis D. Summers and John Fetterman, before the plans fell through. The design was later used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> International Coasters' only two roller coasters which are located at Carowinds and Kings Dominion, both named the Hurler.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, {{and the potential for}} civilian casualties.|$|E
50|$|The United States passed {{many pieces}} of {{environmental}} legislation in <b>the</b> 1970s, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.

50|$|The next settlers, whose {{descendants}} were to remain, came in {{the spring}} of 1762: Protestants of predominantly Ulster origins, brought over by formerly-Nova-Scotia-stationed and by then former-British-army-Captain Alexander McNutt, himself an Ulsterman. Many of these settlers re-used the burnt-out storage cellars of <b>the</b> expelled Acadians <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> their first homes.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, {{the city}} council, {{which was at}} the time the owner of the castle, decided to {{dismantle}} it. The stone from the castle was used for the construction of the bullring (today disappeared), the ruins of the castle were covered with earth and used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of a water tank.|$|R
5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite {{different}} from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
5|$|He {{managed to}} regain a {{starting}} {{spot on the}} Bears' roster, after Barry Minter, the team's veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. Not even a rib cage injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher {{went on to win}} the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker. Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> his professional career and reputation.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{his works}} were {{published}} in the United States for the first time, by Michigan State University Press, who later (in 1958), relinquished the rights to Viking Press. While Narayan's writings often bring out the anomalies in social structures and views, he was himself a traditionalist; in February 1956, Narayan arranged his daughter's wedding following all orthodox Hindu rituals. After the wedding, Narayan began travelling occasionally, continuing to write at least 1500 words a day even while on the road. The Guide was written while he was visiting the United States in 1956 on the Rockefeller Fellowship. While in the U.S., Narayan maintained a daily journal that was to later serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> his book My Dateless Diary. Around this time, on a visit to England, Narayan met his friend and mentor Graham Greene for the first time. On his return to India, The Guide was published; the book is the most representative of Narayan's writing skills and elements, ambivalent in expression, coupled with a riddle-like conclusion. The book won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958.|$|E
50|$|One of {{more radical}} ideas for reusing the Black Knight was voiced by Armstrong-Siddeley, who {{suggested}} that the rocket be repurposed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).

40|$|The GALEN project aims {{to develop}} {{language}} independent concept representation systems <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{next generation of}} multilingual coding systems. Traditional coding schemes have reached the limits {{of what can be}} maintained and managed, and a shift to formal compositional systems is now essential. GALEN is developing one such scheme and an associated concept model, together with criteria for their evaluation. It should provide the flexibility required to cope with the diversity amongst medical applications, whilst ensuring the coherence necessary for integration and re-use of terminologies.

5|$|The Conservation Priority List (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of breeds {{for which}} {{conservation}} is a priority. Published annually, {{the list is}} used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, hatcheries and breeders. This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. Breeds are placed {{in the first three}} categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds, or proof that they are a true breed, instead of a type or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E
5|$|The first road in {{the region}} was the Buffalo Trace, an old bison trail that ran from the Falls of the Ohio to Vincennes. After the capitol was {{relocated}} to Corydon, several local roads were created to connect the new capitol to the Ohio River at Mauckport and to New Albany. The first major {{road in the}} state was the National Road, a project funded by the federal government. The road entered Indiana in 1829, connecting Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute with the eastern states and eventually Illinois and Missouri in the west. The state adopted the advanced methods used to build the national road on a statewide basis and began {{to build a new}} road network that was usable year-round. The North-South Michigan Road was built in the 1830s, connecting Michigan and Kentucky and passing through Indianapolis in the middle. These two new roads were roughly perpendicular within the state and served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> a road system to encompass all of Indiana.|$|E
