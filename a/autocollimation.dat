40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{application}} of quaternions for optimization of reflector parameters at <b>autocollimation</b> measurements {{in comparison with}} a matrix method. Computer-based results on the quaternionic models are presented that have given the possibility to determine conditions of measurement error reduction in view of apriori information on the rotation axis position. The practical synthesis technique for tetrahedron reflector parameters using found ratios is considered. Method. Originally, received conditions for reduction of <b>autocollimation</b> system measurement error are determined {{with the use of}} a matrix method for definition of an angular object position as a set of three equivalent consecutive turns about coordinate axes. At realization of these conditions the numerous recalculation of orientation parameters between various systems of coordinates is necessary that increases complexity and reduces resulting accuracy of <b>autocollimation</b> system at practical measurements. The method of quaternions gives the possibility to analyze the change of an absolute angular position in space, thus, there are conditions of accuracy increase regardless of the used systems of coordinates. Main Results. Researches on the mathematical model have shown, that the orthogonal arrangement of two basic constant directions for autocollimator tetrahedron reflector is optimal with respect to criterion of measurement error reduction at bisection arrangement of actual turn axis against them. Practical Relevance. On the basis of the found ratios between tetrahedron reflector angles and angles of its initial orientation parameters we have developed a practical method of reflector synthesis for <b>autocollimation</b> measurements in case of apriori information on an actual turn axis at monitoring measurements of the shaft or pipelines deformations...|$|E

A method was developed to make the necessary alignment offset, using a counterweight mechanism; <b>autocollimation</b> returns from reference mirrors on the instrument structure and supporting fixturing provided feedback for adjusting the counterweight mechanism.

40|$|In deep {{vertical}} shafts, it is {{not possible}} to use common engineering measurement techniques like e. g. traversing. Therefore the transfer of geodetic networks consists of the separate transfer of both the position and the bearing. Whereas the transfer of the position can be managed by mechanical or optical plumbs, the orientation of the underground network often is determinded by high-precision surveying gyroscopes for north-seeking. This method however, is influenced by deflections from the vertical which are not exactly known. This paper describes a novel method to transfer the bearing by combination of <b>autocollimation</b> with a high-precision inertial navigation system (INS). The principles of <b>autocollimation</b> and INS are introduced. The motion-sequence consists of a reverse movement- comparable to a meaurement in two faces- which provides a symmetric measurement and therefore minimizes the influence of systematic and time-proportional errors of INS.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for end-to-end, full aperture testing of large-aperture telescopes using an innovative variation of a Hartmann mask. This technique is practical for telescopes with primary mirrors tens of meters {{in diameter and}} of any design. Furthermore, it is applicable to the entire optical band (near IR, visible, ultraviolet), relatively insensitive to environmental perturbations, and is suitable for ambient laboratory as well as thermal-vacuum environments. The only restriction is that the telescope optical axis must be parallel to the local gravity vector during testing. The standard Hartmann test utilizes an array of pencil beams that are cut out of a well-corrected wavefront using a mask. The pencil beam array is expanded to fill the full aperture of the telescope. The detector plane of the telescope is translated back and forth along the optical axis {{in the vicinity of}} the nominal focal plane, and the centroid of each pencil beam image is recorded. Standard analytical techniques are then used to reconstruct the telescope wavefront from the centroid data. The expansion of the array of pencil beams is usually accomplished by double passing the beams through the telescope under test. However, this requires a well-corrected, <b>autocollimation</b> flat, the diameter or which is approximately equal to that of the telescope aperture. Thus, the standard Hartmann method does not scale well because of the difficulty and expense of building and mounting a well-corrected, large aperture flat. The innovation in the testing method proposed here is to replace the large aperture, well-corrected, monolithic <b>autocollimation</b> flat with an array of small-aperture mirrors. In addition to eliminating the need for a large optic, the surface figure requirement for the small mirrors is relaxed compared to that required of the large <b>autocollimation</b> flat. The key point that allows this method to work is that the small mirrors need to operate as a monolithic flat only with regard to tip/tilt and not piston because in collimated space piston has no effect on the image centroids. The problem of aligning the small mirrors in tip/tilt requires a two-part solution. First, each mirror is suspended from a two-axis gimbal. The orientation of the gimbal is maintained by gravity. Second, the mirror is aligned such that the mirror normal is parallel to gravity vector. This is accomplished interferometrically in a test fixture. Of course, the test fixture itself needs to be calibrated with respect to gravity...|$|E

40|$|The various {{measurement}} methods for calibrating the indenters in achieving accurate hardness measurement are discussed. The different standards of ISO 6507 and ISO 6508 are prescribed {{for the use}} of indenters for the calibration of hardness testing machines and for the calibration of hardness reference blocks. In interference method, the position of an indenter generatix is fixed by an interferometer.

The reflexion method uses a collimated beam, which is directed on an indenter plane and this method is applicable for pyramidal indenters.

40|$|High-performance space-based optical systems {{typically}} require {{structures that}} exhibit {{high levels of}} dimensional stability over their lifetimes. To better understand the mechanisms for dimensional instability, a novel series of tests were carried out at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on a breadboard high-stability optical bench structure. Goals of the testing were to assess the relative stability {{of a pair of}} reference surfaces and to determine the contributions of various structural elements and joints to dimensional instability. The breadboard was subject to an intensive environmental test campaign that included thermal cycling under vacuum and random vibration testing. Metrology was performed throughout the campaign to assess the dimensional stability response to the various environmental loads. The metrology requirement was challenging, with measurements of micron-level displacement and arcsecond- level tilt over 1 -meter distances being necessary in situ during environmental testing. This issue was resolved using a combination of techniques: a contacting coordinate measurement machine, laser interferometry, and optical <b>autocollimation.</b> The greatest levels of instability were produced by random vibration testing, though evidence of a bedding-in process implies that vibratory conditioning could be used to improve stability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a family of}} XY flexure mechanisms with large ranges of motion, first-order decoupled degrees of freedom, and small parasitic error motions. Synthesis {{is based on an}} systematic and symmetric layout of constraints that are realized by means of common flexure building blocks.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel {{solution for the}} inline control of solar reflector panels based on the <b>autocollimation</b> principle. The proposed technique outperforms previous approaches in several aspects. On the one hand, the inspection cell is only slightly larger than the reflector panel under test, as a result, the inspection cell is compact and improves {{the use of the}} layout of the plant. On the other hand, the measurements are carried out with considerably smaller uncertainties than other approaches. The compact arrangement of reflectors and autocollimators provides a solution that is very stable from the mechanical point of view. The measurement principle also contributes to low measurement uncertainties as it has been demonstrated in multitude of commercially available autocollimators. Finally, the measuring time is really short because the measurement consists on taking a simultaneous measurement with the set of autocollimators, similar to taking one photograph. The commercial feasibility of the proposed approach demands the availability of cheap but yet accurate enough autocollimators.

40|$|A {{metrology}} instrument {{has been}} developed to scan crystals and map the peak tuning angles for frequency conversion from the infrared to the ultra violet over large apertures. The need for such a device emerged from the National Ignition Facility (NIF) program where frequency conversion crystals {{have been found to}} have significant crystallographic axis wander at the large NIF aperture size of 4 1 cm square. With only limited access to a large aperture laser system capable of testing these crystals, scientists have been unable to determine which crystal life-cycle components most affect these angular anomalies. A system that can scan crystals with a small diameter probe laser beam and deliver microradian accuracy and repeatability from probe point to probe point is needed. The Crystal Alignment Verification Equipment (CAVE) is the instrument designed to meet these needs and fit into the budget and time constraints of the ongoing NIF development. In order to measure NIF crystals, the CAVE has a workspace of 50 x 50 cm and an angular measurement accuracy of 10 {micro}radians. Other precision requirements are probe beam energy measurement to 2 % of peak, thermal control to 20 0. 1 °C around the crystal, crystal mounting surface flatness of 1 {micro}m over 40 cm square, and clean operations to Class 100 standards. Crystals are measured in a vertical position in a kinematic mount capable of tuning the crystal to 1 {micro}radian. The mirrors steering the probe beam can be aligned to the same precision. Making tip/tilt mounts with microradian level adjustment is relatively commonplace. The real precision engineering challenge of the CAVE system is maintaining the angular alignment accuracy of the probe laser relative to the crystal for each spatial position to be measured. The design team determined that a precision XY stage with the required workspace and angular accuracy would be prohibitive to develop under the given tight time constraints. Instead the CAVE uses commercially available slides and makes up for their inaccuracies with metrology. The key to the CAVE device is referencing all angular measurements relative to a master reference surface. The angles of the probe laser and the crystal mount are measured relative to a 61 cm optical flat for every spatial location. <b>Autocollimation</b> and imaging are used to achieve the microradian angular precision. Slide errors are removed by alignment of the crystal and the beam for each new probe point through active feedback from the <b>autocollimation</b> system. The frst prototype CAVE system is being constructed and tested at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The mechanical and optical errors are being measured and analyzed to verify the critical performance specification of 10 {micro} radians. Others facing the same challenge of designing point-to-point probe system for measuring optical axes can use the knowledge gained from this design...|$|E

Measurement results for step index fiber, gradient index fiber, and a volume holographic grating are presented. OCIS codes: (060. 2300) Fiber measurements; (180. 5810) Scanning microscopy Most conventional methods for measuring refractive index, such as minimum deviation, critical angle, <b>autocollimation,</b> and ellipsometry are well suited for measuring the index of bulk samples or thin films of homogeneous solids or liquids [1]. In general, however, these methods are not well suited to measuring variations of refractive index that occur on length scales of 10 − 3 to 10 − 6 m. For characterization of transparent objects with index variations on these small length scales, various methods of phase microscopy are typically used. Traditional techniques such as Zernike phase-contrast microscopy and Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy render transparent phase structures visible, but do not offer a quantitative measure of the refractive index. Efforts towards quantitative phase microscopy, such as quantitative DIC microscopy [2], structured-illumination phase microscopy [3], digital holography [4], and optical coherence tomography [5], provide quantitative measures of optical path length, but not a direct measure of refractive index. For applications such as the characterization of integrated optical devices, fiber measurements, and development of holographic materials, a direct measurement of refractive index variations is needed.

40|$|Gyroscopes and gyrotheodolites {{need to be}} {{calibrated}} in arranged {{time period}} for their proper function. As known these instruments measure horizontal angles from the astronomical North (astronomical Azimuth) with an accuracy of ± 3 ″. This calibration is done with a collimator system, which is a level telescope set to the infinity. As an instrument is {{placed in front of}} the collimator’s telescope, its cross-hairs are aligned with the cross-hairs of the collimator and the instrument measures the astronomical azimuth of the direction between the point where it is forced centered and the point where the collimator’s cross-hairs coincide.

The theoretical analysis, of a new method, which leads, to the determination of the astronomical azimuth, in short time (about 20 min) is described. The achieved accuracy is also given. This determination may be done by astrogeodetic observations to the Polaris (α Ursa Minoris) by using a new-constructed system consisting of a high accuracy total station connected with a GPS receiver, which provides accurate UTC time.

40|$|The {{principal}} point {{has long been}} {{regarded as one of}} the fundamental parameters in camera calibration. In the age of film based aerial and large format terrestrial cameras ’ the {{principal point}} could be located by a variety of techniques with a certainty of +/- 10 mm (Carman & Brown, 1961) and this was considered sufficient. However, aerial cameras were precision, purpose built, expensive pieces of equipment where the assembly was painstaking and the location of the principal point measured to a known tolerance. In the digital era photogrammetrists, and many others, are using cameras which have not been specifically designed or built for photogrammetry. For these cameras there is no requirement for the manufacturers to position the lens in a pre-defined location relative to the image s nsing plane or for the lens manufacturer to align the lens elements precisely. In fact, deviations from the centre of the sensor can be a considerable percentage of the extent of the sensor (up to 10 per cent for some zoom lenses. (Burner, 1995)). This paper discusses the development of methods of obtaining the location of the principal point, considers the relationship between the principal point and other parameters in the functional model, and shows how the location of this point can be estimated with and without recourse to <b>autocollimation</b> methods...|$|E

Then, the optical system was designed according to the demand of the measurement system. A single Field Programming Gate Array (FPGA) was used to implement double CMOS image sensor imaging, spot identifying, subdivision positioning, three;dimensional attitude angle calculation and rapid communication with a USB. To ensure the unity of the actual equipment parameter and design data, a high precision calibration method was researched for the three;dimensional attitude angle measuring device. Finally, three;dimensional attitude angles were tested to verify this measuring device, and the degrees and the factors affecting the angle measuring accuracy were analyzed as well.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a set of}} initial results of a quality assessment study of 2 different types of sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, carried out over an especially designed and constructed test field. The PIQuAT (Portable Imagery Quality Assessment Test Field) field had been designed especially {{for the purposes of}} determining the quality parameters of UAV sensors, especially in terms of the spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions and chosen geometric aspects. The sensor used include a multispectral framing camera and a high-resolution RGB sensor. The flights were conducted from a number of altitudes ranging from 10 m to 200 m above the test field. Acquiring data at a number of different altitudes allowed the authors to evaluate the obtained results and check for possible linearity of the calculated quality assessment parameters. The radiometric properties of the sensors were evaluated from images of the grayscale target section of the PIQuAT field. The spectral resolution of the imagery was determined based on a number of test samples with known spectral reflectance curves. These reference spectral reflectance curves were then compared with spectral reflectance coefficients at the wavelengths registered by the miniMCA camera. Before conducting all of these experiments in field conditions, the interior orientation parameters were calculated for the MiniMCA and RGB sensor in laboratory conditions.

40|$|Present {{alignment}} methods {{already have}} an accuracy of some microns, allowing {{in general the}} fairly precise assembly of multi element optical systems. Nevertheless, they suffer decisive drawbacks, such as the necessity of an iterative process, stepping through all optical surfaces of the system when using <b>autocollimation</b> telescopes. In contrast to these limitations, the wavefront based alignment offers an elegant approach to potentially reach sub-μm accuracy in the alignment within a highly efficient process, that simultaneously acquires and evaluates the best optical solution possible. However, the practical use of these capabilities in corresponding alignment devices needs to take real sensor behavior into account. This publication will especially elaborate {{on the influence of}} the sensor properties in relation to the alignment process. The first dominant requirement is a highly stable measurement, since tiny perturbations in the optical system will have an also tiny influence on the wavefront. Secondly, the lateral sampling of the measured wavefront is supposed to be as high as possible, {{in order to be able}} to extract higher order Zernike coefficients reliable. The resulting necessity of using the largest sensor area possible conflicts with the requirement to allow a certain lateral displacement of the measured spot, indicating a perturbation. A movement of the sensor with suitable stages in turn leads to additional uncertainties connected to the actuators. Further factors include the SNR-ratio of the sensor as well as multiple measurements, in order to i mprove data repeatability. This publication will present a procedure of dealing with these relevant influence factors. Depending on the optical system and its properties the optimal adjustment of these parameters is derived...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{with a few}} investigations on sensing/measurement of small angle rotation/tilt using Pattern Imaging Method. The methodology involves looking at the tailored-objects located adjacent to the observer (CCD camera) through a mirror and extracts the angular position of the mirror from their images by processing the latter through object specific algorithm. Its principal advantage {{stems from the fact}} that small-angle measurement can be done using ambient light which is neither collimated nor filtered for single wavelength. This makes the associated optical configuration not only simple but also robust for the said application, in comparison to currently competing technologies based on <b>Autocollimation</b> and Interferometry. The present thesis elaborates specifically four new Pattern-Designs proposed for tailoring the spatial-brightness of the objects. Introducing for the first time, processing algorithms based on ‘Modified Fringe-Processing Strategy’ and ‘Phase-Only-Correlation’, the investigations demonstrate enhanced performance for small angle measurement with all the proposed pattern designs. The first three designs for the pattern are evaluated for 1 -D measurement through fringe processing approach while the fourth pattern design is evaluated for 2 -D measurement through Phase-only-Correlation. The results of the investigations are utilized to propose, design and develop a novel optical inclinometer which can work with any of the proposed pattern designs as the object. The first three pattern-designs rely upon sinusoidal modulation of the object surface and utilize three custom developed algorithms -Algorithm-A, Algorithm-B and Algorithm-C -to extract two quantities namely wrapped phase Δαw and unwrapped phase Δαuw, from the captured images. Each of these quantities will have an associated measurement range and accuracy corresponding to any of the three pattern designs. All measurements are carried out keeping the object/camera to mirror distance constant at 250 mm. From wrapped phase measurement, all the three designs, each with pitch of 2 mm for sinusoidal modulation and held at a distance of 250 mm from the mirror, have been found to facilitate reliable angle measurement over a range of 850 arc seconds with accuracy better than 1 arc second after curve fitting the experimentally obtained data. From unwrapped phase measurement, the color coded as well as BCD coded composite patterns, when tested using five bands of sinusoidal modulation (with a pitch of 2 mm) and held at a distance of 250 mm from the mirror, facilitated reliable angle measurement over a larger range of nearly 10. The 2 -D angle measurement using fourth pattern-design and the Algorithm-D, facilitated measurement over a range of 10 with an accuracy of 9 arc seconds when the distance between the mirror and the pattern is held at 250 mm. A comparison of the results from the present investigation with the best performance from other investigators reveals the following. The proposed modifications in the processing algorithms as well as the pattern designs help to achieve a measurement range of 750 arc seconds with accuracy better than 1 arc second from this method, with an object pattern whose lateral size is smaller by a factor of nearly 15. Such a size reduction in the object as well as the associated mirror would help to construct angle measuring instruments that work on this method more compactly. The results of the investigation have been utilized to propose and demonstrate a novel prototype optical inclinometer which has been experimentally found to work in a range of 0. 40 with accuracy nearly 6 arc seconds...|$|E
