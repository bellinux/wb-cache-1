The {{second floor of}} the Gate House was a drawing room, lit by square-headed windows decorated with stone mullions and transom, and fitted with a fine Elizabethan fireplace, which had a marble frame and carved wood overmantel that enclosed the fireplace from the floor to the ceiling and had early Jacobean architecture style paneling with a pair of trimmed arches that were encased and separated by ornate columns, directly above the center of the marble arch frame.

50|$|In August 1987, the Sierra RS500 Cosworth was homologated {{with larger}} turbos {{and a new}} rear deck spoiler, plus the added bonus of an extra 100+ HP. Fords took pole {{position}} in all the remaining six events, and was first over the finish line in four of them. Disqualification of the works Eggenberger Motorsport cars from the 1987 James Hardie 1000 in Australia for wheel <b>arch</b> <b>panel</b> irregularities was a bitter pill for the Fords, depriving West German pair Klaus Ludwig and Klaus Niedzwiedz of the world championship and handing it to Schnitzer BMW's Italian driver, Roberto Ravaglia. The pill was harder to swallow since the Texaco RS500 Sierras ran in the same configuration at five {{of the last six}} WTCC races, but were only protested against at Bathurst (Eggenberger modified the wheel arches to make them legal for the final race of the championship, the InterTEC 500 at the Fuji Speedway in Japan). The Eggenberger Motorsport team did however claim the entrants' prize.|$|E
50|$|The former Wells-Jackson Carriage House Complex {{is located}} in a {{residential}} area between downtown Burlington and the University of Vermont campus, {{on the south side of}} Jackson Court, a short, densely built residential side street off South Willard Street. The complex includes three buildings: the wood-frame tack house and coachman's quarters, both set near the street, and the large brick carriage house, which stands behind those two, and is accessed via a drive between them. The tack house and coachman's house both have redstone foundations, and have exteriors finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingles in the Queen Anne Victorian style. The carriage house has a 2-1/2 story main block, from which two large wings project. Its main entrance, facing north towards Jackson Court, has a large two-leaf doorway topped by a hayloft entrance in the form of a Palladian window. These are set in a two-story round <b>arch</b> <b>panel</b> with brick quoined borders and a granite keystone. The interior of the carriage barn was, at the time of its construction, fitted with a wide array of modern amenities, including steam heat, electricity, and plumbing.|$|E

40|$|A 37 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a 5 -month history of hoarseness. She had no other clinically significant medical history or history of trauma. An ENT doctor diag-nosed swelling of the right vocal chord. With the hoarse-ness being refractory to medical treatment, a chest com-puted tomography (CT) scan was performed which revealed distinct elongation and kinking of the bronchial arteries with multiple aneurysms near the right subcla-vian artery in a location that could cause compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Panel A: posterior view). A contrast-enhanced whole-body magnetic reso-nance angiography ruled out intracranial, abdominal or acral aneurysm formation (Panel B). Given the uncertain origin of the aneurysms, selective angiography of the thoracic aorta and the supra-aortic vessels showed {{a total of five}} aneurysms along the aortic <b>arch</b> (<b>Panel</b> C) : aneurysms numbers 1 and 3 were supplied from a bron-chial artery and the right internal thoracic artery; aneur-ysms numbers 4 and 5 were found to originate from {{the right and the left}} subclavian artery respectively; aneu-rysm number 2 originated from the brachiocephalic trunk. Considering the high risk of massive bleeding and neu-rologic injury with open surgical treatment, we decided to proceed with endovascular embolization. All five aneur-ysms were selectively embolized in two consecutive ses-sions using interlocking detachable coils (IDC; Boston Sci...|$|E
