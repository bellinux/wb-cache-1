5|$|Born in 1895 to {{a middle}} class family with {{military}} traditions, McCudden joined the Royal Engineers in 1910. Having an interest in mechanics he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1913 at which time he first came into regular contact with aircraft. At the outbreak of war in 1914 he flew <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> before training as a fighter pilot in 1916.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Dashnaktsutiun {{joined the}} Second International until its {{dissolution}} during World War I. It later joined the reformed Socialist International and remained a full member until 1960, when {{it decided to}} pull out of the organization. In 1996, it was re-accepted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> member, and in 1999 the Dashnaks earned full membership in the international organization. The party was also a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Norway {{entered a}} {{cooperation}} with the United States, {{which resulted in the}} construction of the Norwegian Space Centre at Andøya. In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer,</b> partially because of the close {{cooperation with the}} US and partially because of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E

5|$|Undeterred, McCudden made {{a formal}} {{application}} {{to become a}} pilot and fly on operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing. His reputation as a mechanic had spread since his supervision in the unit had led to a record-low number of engine failures. He continued to fly <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> despite the recommendation of his rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|Wallace was {{attached}} to No. 2 Squadron, 1st Wing Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on 14 February 1915 <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer,</b> alongside William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse, the first serviceman of the RFC to be awarded the Victoria Cross. By July he was the squadron's senior observer and was made up to lieutenant on 21 July 1915. On 22 August 1915, Wallace was on a photographic reconnaissance mission in a B.E.2c piloted by his friend 2Lt Charles Gallie. The plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and came straight down at Sainghin, near Lille, northern France.|$|E

5|$|After {{three years}} as Inspector-General, {{and in order to}} gain staff experience, Davies was {{attached}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> to a number of units in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. During this time, he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII. At the end of the one-year attachment, he had so impressed the British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. As such, he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade, only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} brigade was an Imperial Service unit, the cavalry regiments and brigade {{headquarters}} included attached British Indian Army Special Service Officers (SSO), {{but only as}} advisors. In 1914, the three cavalry regiments had two SSOs attached, and Colonel J. Desaraj Urs Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore State Forces accompanied the Mysore Lancers <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer.</b> The Jodhpur Lancers joined the brigade with seven SSOs attached. Throughout the war the establishment of British officers assigned to the cavalry regiments was gradually increased; in February 1915 there were four in each regiment, in 1917 another two were assigned and in mid-1918 {{a full complement of}} twelve British officers in each of the regiments was reached.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E

5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver {{grew up on}} the Iowa frontier, and was {{involved}} with the Republican Party from its early days in the late 1850s. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the Union Army. Weaver saw action at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Resaca, and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. After the war, he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics. Weaver sought nomination to the House of Representatives and the Governorship, but each time was defeated by candidates from the party's more conservative faction, led by William B. Allison. He campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{was ordered}} to relieve Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher as {{commander}} of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers , Minneapolis and San Francisco. This {{was part of the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet, based at Pearl Harbor. He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was married to Kinkaid's sister Dorothy. Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> during the attempt to relieve Wake Island, and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.|$|E

5|$|Lukis was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in July 1916 and promoted to lieutenant in December. On 25February 1917, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and was posted to No.1 Squadron (also known until 1918 as No.67 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps), operating in Sinai and Palestine. He undertook reconnaissance missions <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> in Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s from April to September 1917. In January 1918 he completed pilot training and began flying fighter and ground attack sorties in Bristol Fighters. He was twice mentioned in despatches for distinguished service with the AFC in the Middle East, the first gazetted on 16January 1918, and the second on 12January 1920. Lukis finished the war a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and returned to Australia on 5March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{repeatedly}} {{sought a}} post with Allied forces fighting against France, but {{was sent to}} the Continent only <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer.</b> In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to join with the Prussians and Swedes and attack the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Grenville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell, and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town.|$|E

This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E

5|$|Ukraine {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> in August 2013. Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an association agreement with the European Union and exclusively pursue integration with the EEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that ended his term as president of Ukraine and led to the Crimean Crisis. The country's membership in the EEU was seen by some analysts as the key {{to the success of the}} union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the wake of the crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue integration with the EU.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Norway, training started for Operation Puma, {{the occupation of}} the Canary Islands. The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was going to join the war {{on the side of}} the Axis forces. The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U-Boat base. The force assembled included five commando units, an army brigade, two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms. Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the Landing Ship, Infantry HMS Royal Scotsman. The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs-of-Staff. On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa. The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942, after the cancellation of the operation. While this was happening a new second in command (2IC) was appointed, Major Charles Vaughan, and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer. Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> and had applied for a posting to the commandos.|$|E
