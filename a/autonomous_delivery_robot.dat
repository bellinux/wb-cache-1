40|$|Robots are {{becoming}} increasingly integrated into the workplace, impacting organizational structures and processes, and affecting products and services created by these organizations. While robots promise significant benefits to organizations, their introduction poses a variety of design challenges. In this paper, we use ethnographic data collected at a hospital using an <b>autonomous</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>robot</b> to examine how organizational factors affect the way its members respond to robots and the changes engendered by their use. Our analysis uncovered dramatic differences between the medical and post-partum units in how people integrated the robot into their workflow and their perceptions of and interactions with it. Different patient profiles in these units led to differences in workflow, goals, social dynamics, {{and the use of}} the physical environment. In medical units, low tolerance for interruptions, a discrepancy between the perceived cost and benefits of using the robot, and breakdowns due to high traffic and clutter in the robot’s path caused the robot to have a negative impact on the workflow and staff resistance. On the contrary, post-partum units integrated the robot into their workflow and social context. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines for the development of robots for organizations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims to {{lay down}} the {{foundations}} of an approach to autonomous mobile robot (AMR) navigation based on the explicit representation of mental entities (desire, intention, obligation, etc.) underlying robot behavior, considered as autonomous active entities. The approach is intended to integrate concepts from the area of distributed architectures and of mental entity representation and it is claimed to allow the achievement of both robust and sophisticated robot behavior. Starting from {{an analysis of the}} evolution of AMR control architectures, the introduction of mental entities in the context of distributed control architectures is motivated as a further step in the direction of making explicit the deep reasons that underlie the behavior of intelligent systems. A simple application example concerning an <b>autonomous</b> mail <b>delivery</b> <b>robot</b> is finally provided: the example demonstrates the main features and the potential of the proposed approach in facing unusual and complex tasks. ...|$|R
50|$|Before BrainRush, Bushnell's {{most recent}} company was uWink, {{a company that}} evolved out of an early project called In10City (pronounced 'Intensity') which was a concept of an {{entertainment}} complex and dining experience. uWink was started by Bushnell and his business adviser Loni Reeder, who also designed the original logo for the company. The company has gone through several failed iterations including a touch-screen kiosk design, a company to run cash and prize awards {{as part of their}} uWin concept and also an online Entertainment Systems network. After nearly 7 years and over $24 million in investor funding, the touchscreen kiosks/bartop model was closed amid complaints of unpaid prizes and lack of maintaining service agreements with locations to keep the kiosk/bartop units in working condition. The latest iteration (announced in 2005) is a new interactive entertainment restaurant called the uWink Media Bistro, whose concept builds off his Chuck E. Cheese venture and previous 1988-1989 venture Bots Inc., which developed similar systems of customer-side point-of-sale touch-screen terminals in addition to <b>autonomous</b> pizza <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> for Little Caesar's Pizza. The plan was for guests to order their food and drinks using screens at each table, on which they may also play games with each other and watch movie trailers and short videos. The multiplayer network type video games that allowed table to table interaction or even with table group play never materialized. Guest often spotted the OSX based machine being constantly re-booted in order to play much simpler casual video games. The first Bistro opened in Woodland Hills, California on October 16, 2006. A second in Hollywood was established, and in 2008 the company opened a third Southern California restaurant and one in Mountain View, California, in Silicon Valley. All the restaurants have since closed.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{distributed}} mobile robot platform to deliver parts around a model construction site. The platform's <b>robots,</b> specialized into <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> and assembly robots, use a distributed coverage algorithm {{to determine where}} parts should be delivered. The robots consist of a mobility platform (iRobot iCreate), a manipulation platform (Crustcrawler arm), and an IR communication system to enable recognition and grasping of parts. To control the robot hardware, we implemented software in Java. The <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> use IR communication to find parts at a supply station. After communicating over UDP multicast with assembly station <b>robots,</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> deliver parts to the assembly robots based on their coverage control algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, we constructed a hardware system of 4 robots, connected to a VICON motion capture system for localization. We discuss the results of successful hardware and software testing of {{the system as a}} method of delivering parts around a construction site, and we discuss future plans to use the platform to assemble parts once delivered. by Adrienne Bolger.

40|$|Navigation {{methods for}} office <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> {{need to take}} various sources of {{uncertainty}} into account {{in order to get}} robust performance. In previous work, we developed a reliable navigation technique that uses partially observable Markov models to represent metric, actuator, and sensor uncertainties. This paper describes an algorithm that adjusts the probabilities of the initialMarkov model by passively observing the robot's interactions with its environment. The learned probabilities more accurately reflect the actual uncertainties in the environment, which ultimately leads to improved navigation performance. The algorithm, an extension of the Baum-Welch algorithm, learns without a teacher and addresses the issues of limited memory and the cost of collecting training data. Empirical results show that the algorithm learns good Markov models {{with a small amount of}} training data. 1 Introduction Navigation methods for office <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> need to take various sources of uncertainty i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An office <b>delivery</b> <b>robot</b> {{receives}} {{a large amount}} of sensory data and there is uncertainty in its action outcomes. The robot should not only accomplish its goals using environmental information, but also consider various exceptions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system using hierarchical planning of modular behaviour selection networks to generate autonomous behaviour in the office <b>delivery</b> <b>robot.</b> Behaviour selection networks, one of the well-known behaviour-based methods suitable for goal-oriented tasks, are made up of several smaller behaviour modules. Planning is attached to the construct and adjust sequences of the modules by considering the sub-goals, the priority in each task and the user feedback. This helps the robot to quickly react in dynamic situations as well as achieve global goals efficiently. The proposed system is verified with both the Webot simulator and a Khepera II robot that runs in a real office environment carrying out delivery tasks. Experimental results have shown that a robot can achieve goals and generate module sequences successfully even in unpredictable situations. Additionally, the proposed planning method reduced the elapsed time during tasks by 17. 5 % since it adjusts the behaviour module sequences more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Robotic {{manipulators}} {{are widely}} used in industry where the environment may be too hostile for workers. However, their application has been limited to an industrial setting where the robot is mounted on a stationary base. It is {{of great interest to}} expand the application of the robot manipulator to where it is mounted on an <b>autonomous</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicle. This application would enable the delivery vehicle not only to locate objects in a hostile environment, but also to perform tasks that would entirely remove the human being from the hostile environment. This thesis explores the feasibility of implementing a manipulator on an autonomous vehicle. A Zebra-ZERO Force Control Robot is mounted on a moving platform for feasibility simulations of an <b>autonomous</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicle. The Zebra-ZERO system consists primarily of a robotic arm with six degrees of freedom, a six-axis force sensor mounted {{at the end of the}} manipulator, and supporting computer hardware and software. In this thesis, the capability of the Zebra-ZERO system is expanded by integrating it with an external sonar ranging system. The sonar ranging system provides range feedback that is critical for positioning the manipulator while it is mounted on a moving platform. Test results demonstrate that the manipulator mounted on a moving platform is able to compensate for random platform motions and successfully perform various manipulation tasks. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.
