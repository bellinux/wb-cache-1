Pen-based plotters rely on {{contact with the}} paper (but not impact, per se) and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images. Since the pens output continuous lines, {{they were able to}} produce technical drawings of higher resolution than was achievable with dot-matrix technology. [...] Some plotters used roll-fed paper, and therefore had minimal restriction {{on the size of the}} output in one dimension. These plotters were capable of producing quite sizable drawings.|$|E

40|$|High {{dynamic range}} (HDR) images offer a greater range of {{intensity}} levels than most digital cameras and electronic displays and {{is said to}} be the future of imaging, as expressed by Ward in [6] as well as Meyer in [2] where he says, “In the coming decade, HDR digital imaging technology will arrive, and change how we take, manipulate, store, use and display images forever. ” Displaying these images electronically requires very expensive equipment and printing them was said to be impossible by a distinguished researcher at a recent computer graphics conference. This project looks at devising a method of printing HDR images with greater quality by coming up with <b>alternate</b> <b>printing</b> methods and trying to overcome the limited dynamic range of a single piece of ordinary paper. Most related research is in the field of displaying HDR images on low dynamic output devices by means of a tonal mapping. Ward [5] talks of ways of storing the full colour range of a photograph, rather than just what can be displayed on a particular display, and only then mapping the full range of colours to the limited range of the display. Different methods of display of these images are discussed in [3] and [4]. These, along with other techniques such as radiance maps [1], will contribute towards methods of approach...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the year}} 1000, {{butterfly}} binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images {{to be easily}} replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a codex with <b>alternate</b> openings of <b>printed</b> and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings. Only relatively small volumes (...) were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a tao, with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 juan in 595 tao.|$|R
40|$|Rayner, Fischer, and Pollatsek (1998, Vision Research) {{demonstrated}} that reading unspaced text in Indo-European languages produces a substantial reading cost in word identification (as deduced from an increased word-frequency effect on target words {{embedded in the}} unspaced vs. spaced sentences) and in eye movement guidance (as deduced from landing sites closer {{to the beginning of}} the words in unspaced sentences). However, the addition of spaces between words comes with a cost: nearby words may fall outside high-acuity central vision, thus reducing the potential benefits of parafoveal processing. In the present experiment, we introduced a salient visual cue intended to facilitate the process of word segmentation without compromising visual acuity: each <b>alternating</b> word was <b>printed</b> in a different colour (i. e.,). Results only revealed a small reading cost of unspaced alternating colour sentences relative to the spaced sentences.

50|$|Sheng took sticky {{clay and}} cut in it {{characters}} as thin as {{the edge of a}} coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame {{and set it on the}} iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it.

40|$|Purpose: To make an adaptable, head shaped {{radionuclide}} phantom {{to simulate}} molecular imaging {{of the brain}} using clinical acquisition and reconstruction protocols. This will allow the characterization and correction of scanner characteristics, and improve the accuracy of clinical image analysis, including the application of databases of normal subjects. Methods: A fused deposition modeling 3 D printer was {{used to create a}} head shaped phantom made up of transaxial slabs, derived from a simulated MRI dataset. The attenuation of the printed polylactide (PLA), measured by means of the Hounsfield unit on CT scanning, was set to match that of the brain by adjusting the proportion of plastic filament and air (fill ratio). Transmission measurements were made to verify the attenuation of the printed slabs. The radionuclide distribution within the phantom was created by adding 99 mTc pertechnetate to the ink cartridge of a paper printer and printing images of gray and white matter anatomy, segmented from the same MRI data. The complete subresolution sandwich phantom was assembled from <b>alternate</b> 3 D <b>printed</b> slabs and radioactive paper sheets, and then imaged on a dual headed gamma camera to simulate an HMPAO SPECT scan. Results: Reconstructions of phantom scans successfully used automated ellipse fitting to apply attenuation correction. This removed the variability inherent in manual application of attenuation correction and registration inherent in existing cylindrical phantom designs. The resulting images were assessed visually and by count profiles and found to be similar to those from an existing elliptical PMMA phantom. Conclusions: The authors have demonstrated the ability to create physically realistic HMPAO SPECT simulations using a novel head-shaped 3 D printed subresolution sandwich method phantom. The phantom can be used to validate all neurological SPECT imaging applications. A simple modification of the phantom design to use thinner slabs would make it suitable for use in PET...|$|R
