5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable to catch <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> in the field is venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that <b>a</b> <b>snake,</b> Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> held by {{the healer}} Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed <b>a</b> <b>snake,</b> but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, {{but the majority of}} atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body or between his legs.|$|E
5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central {{to the lives of}} the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of <b>a</b> <b>Snake</b> tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent <b>a</b> <b>snake,</b> giving the Snake River its name.|$|E

5|$|Snake scales {{occur as}} a motif {{regularly}} in computer action games. <b>A</b> <b>snake</b> scale was portrayed as a clue in the 1982 film Blade Runner.

25|$|It is also {{important}} to avoid snakes that appear to be dead, as some species will actually roll over on their backs and stick out their tongue to fool potential threats. <b>A</b> <b>snake's</b> detached head can immediately act by reflex and potentially bite.

40|$|Inspired by {{the bite}} and {{swallowing}} function of <b>a</b> <b>snake’s</b> mouth, <b>a</b> robot end‐effector grabbing mechanism was designed. The grabbing movement is realized by the ‘bite’ {{function of the}} bionic snake mouth actuator, and the ‘swallowing’ function insures a continuous grip on the object. To implement the continuous grip function of the new robot end‐effector, the complex motion of <b>a</b> <b>snake’s</b> mouth is simplified into three basic movements based on the anatomy of <b>a</b> <b>snake’s</b> mouth and {{with a combination of}} bionics and engineering. The upper jaw consists of a double four‐bar linkage mechanism and the lower jaw mechanism implementing a lateral expansion function are the two elements of the robot end‐effector. The relationship model and the corresponding curves of the actuating force and gripping force are necessary to implement an open‐loop control of the robot end‐effector. Through analysis and simulation, linkage parameters are determined to implement the desired motion...|$|R
