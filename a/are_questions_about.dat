5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the {{external}} {{validity of the}} AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

AQAP's most determined opponent, the Houthis, disengaged to face rival Yemeni militias {{at the same time}} as they were being hit by coalition air strikes; Yemeni troops in the south remained in their bases instead of confronting al-Qaeda militants, fearing Saudi air strikes on any troop movements. With the destruction of much of Yemen's military infrastructure by the coalition, even once peace is achieved, there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the ability of the country to confront its Islamist militancy problem.|$|E
500|$|During his {{successful}} 2005 season, 32-year-old Kinkladze {{said he hoped}} to play on well into his thirties. The 2006 season, however, was his last. He sustained an injury in Rubin's first competitive match, a 1–0 cup match defeat against Shinnik which {{proved to be the}} last time he played a full match. A recurrence of an old injury meant he was sidelined for longer than expected, only making his return to full training in late May. Kinkladze continued to struggle to maintain fitness, making five further appearances for Rubin, two of which were starts. A match against Rostov on 20 August 2006 was the last of Kinkladze's playing career. In September, he was called to the Georgia national team but did not play or appear on the substitutes' bench. A short time later he had to undergo another course of medical treatment. He also passed a thorough medical examination, the results of which were reported as the deciding factor for his future at the club. In October, he was an unused substitute just once; he and his compatriots were the subject of criticism from Rubin's general director who announced to the press [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the Georgians in the team regarding their training and attitude to football". In November, Kinkladze again suffered an injury and missed the remainder of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than two}} decades after the {{widespread}} introduction of AS to English-speaking audiences, {{there are hundreds of}} books, articles and websites describing it; prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup. However, questions remain concerning many aspects of AS; whether it should be a separate condition from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study. The diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome is tentative, there is little consensus among clinical researchers about the usage of the term [...] "Asperger's syndrome", and there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. It is likely that the definition of the condition will change as new studies emerge and it will eventually be understood as a multifactorial heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder involving a catalyst that results in prenatal or perinatal changes in brain structures.|$|E
