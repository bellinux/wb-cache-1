5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E
5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b> There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> {{influences}} {{the risk of}} the development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

S 9. 5. 3 Conference Theme: Advancing Behavior Change SciencePURPOSE: To examine relationships of perceived park proximity, park quality, neighborhood physical <b>and</b> social <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> with recreational physical activity among mid-older aged adults. Additionally, we examined moderation effects of park quality and neighborhood physical <b>and</b> social <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> on the relationship between park proximity and recreational physical activity. METHODS: Self-reported cross-sectional data on park proximity, quality, neighborhood physical <b>and</b> social <b>environmental</b> <b>factors,</b> recreational walking <b>and</b> other moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) were collected among 2700 Australian adults (57 - 69 years). RESULTS: Park proximity was positively related to engagement in recreational walking if participants reported that others were physically active in their neighborhood. Park quality and social trust and cohesion were related to more recreational walking among those who walked for recreation. No relationships for neighborhood physical <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> were observed, nor did any <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> relate to other recreational MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Park proximity, quality <b>and</b> social <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> might be important to promote recreational walking among mid-older aged adults. More research is needed to unravel the complex relationships between parks, neighborhood physical <b>and</b> social <b>environmental</b> characteristics <b>and</b> recreational PA...|$|R

Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b> Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
