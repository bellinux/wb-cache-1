The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the day, recording in different rooms, {{and listening to the}} Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was compounded by her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E

5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested at <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes {{to the number}} of lanes merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the {{tawny nurse shark}} {{is believed to be}} a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E
