It was later reduced {{and is expected to}} rise , with 80 floors.

Several other buildings have been proposed to rise over , including One Brickell City Centre, but have been reduced by the FAA. Approvals for comparably tall buildings in Miami are very rare due to the proximity of Miami International Airport (MIA). The main runways of MIA align planes taking off and landing directly over the greater downtown area, and for this reason the Federal Aviation <b>Administration</b> <b>sets</b> precise height limits for construction in Downtown Miami. The fate of high rise construction in Miami was greatly threatened by a [...] "One Engine Inoperative" [...] (OEI) policy proposed by the FAA in 2014. This proposal would drastically reduce the maximum permitted height of structures around 388 airports in the country, even causing existing structures to be modified. In the end, the FAA did not go forward with the extreme limitations and even began giving quicker approvals to buildings with heights up to [...] above sea level, leading to many proposed and approved supertall projects.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for {{classifying}} state secrets into sensitivity levels is to tailor the risk to the level of protection. The U.S. government specifies in some detail the procedures for protecting classified information. The rooms or buildings for holding and handling classified material must have a facility clearance at the same level as the most sensitive material to be handled. Good quality commercial physical security standards generally suffice for lower levels of classification; at the highest levels, people sometimes must work in rooms designed like bank vaults (see Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility - SCIF). The U.S. Congress has such facilities inside the Capitol Building, among other Congressional handling procedures for protecting confidentiality. The U.S. General Services <b>Administration</b> <b>sets</b> standards for locks and containers used to store classified material. The most commonly-approved security containers resemble heavy-duty file cabinets with a combination lock in the middle of one drawer. In response to advances in methods to defeat mechanical combination locks, the U.S. government switched to electromechanical locks that limit the rate of attempts to unlock them. After a specific number of failed attempts, they will permanently lock, requiring a locksmith to reset them.|$|E

40|$|Background. The ideal {{duration}} of intravascular administration set use is unknown. Studies have compared the infective implications of 1 – 7 days of use. The Centers for Disease Control recommend at least 3 days usage. No previous study has evaluated {{the accuracy of}} volume delivery or integrity of <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> after prolonged use. Aim. To evaluate the accuracy and condition of intravascular <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> used continuously for 7 days. Design. Prospective, randomized, experimental study in the laboratory setting. Methods. Four <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} deliver 2 mL/hour (IMED® syringe set 2280 – 0000), 20, 50 or 100 mL/hour (IMED® infusion sets 2210 – 0500) of crystalloid solution continuously for 7 days through an IMED® Gemini® four channel infusion pump (PC 4). At study commencement and daily for 7 days, a 4 -hour volume measurement and an inspection for leaks/erosion of <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> occurred for each administration set (total measurements = 32). Results. Mean volume outputs over 4 hours were 7 · 84 mL (2 mL/hour), 80 · 66 mL (20 mL/hour), 205 · 35 (50 mL/hour) and 406 · 37 (100 mL/hour). These differed significantly from the programmed volumes (P= 0 · 00 – 0 · 01). Usage duration did not influence performance (F= 0 · 866, P= 0 · 55). Accuracy of volume delivery differed significantly with pump speed (F= 106 · 933, P < 0 · 001) exhibiting increased volume to 50 mL/hour then a reduction at 100 mL/hour. Differences were within manufacturer specifications (± 5 %) and were clinically acceptable. All <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> remained in appropriate condition displaying no leakage or erosion. Conclusion. There were small inaccuracies found between programmed and delivered volumes, however, there was no deterioration in performance over time. This suggests that inaccuracies were because of normal pump performance rather than the <b>administration</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>sets</b> retain acceptable accuracy and condition after 7 days continuous use.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{intensive}} care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional needs. Heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4 % to 15 %. Our {{objective was to}} investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1 -L feeding bottles and newly designed <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> over hanging times of 24 hrs in the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Cultures of feeding bottles, <b>administration</b> <b>sets,</b> and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of feeding bottles and 74 % of infusion sets contained > 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /mL. Gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90 % and 92 %, respectively. Bacterial counts of feeding bottles were 10 (2) - 10 (5) CFU/mL, and the main bacteria isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. One third of all cultured bacteria in feeding bottles, <b>administration</b> <b>sets,</b> stomach, and lungs belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the ICU. None of the 1 -L feeding bottles with a hanging time of 19 - 24 hrs was contaminated. Only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. With time and the increasing severity of disease, the <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. The final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands. CONCLUSION: Despite an almost ideal design of the enteral nutrition delivery system, a 4 % contamination rate of initially sterile feedings with clinically relevant bacteria and the fact that only manipulated systems showed bacterial growth are of concer...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} routine intravenous (IV) administration set changes on central venous catheter (CVC) colonization and catheter-related bacteremia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Eighteen-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in a large metropolitan hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-one patients with 404 chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulfadiazine-coated multilumen CVCs. INTERVENTIONS: CVCs inserted in the ICU and in situ on day 4 were randomized to have their IV <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> changed on day 4 (n = 203) or not at all (n = 201). Use of fluid containers and blood product <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> was limited to 24 hours. CVCs were removed when not required, infection was suspected, or in place on day 7. Catheter cultures were performed on removal by blinded laboratory staff. Catheter-related bacteremia was diagnosed by a blinded intensivist using strict definitions. Data were collected regarding catheter duration, site, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, patient age, diagnosis, hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, immune status, number of fluid containers and IV injections, and administration of propofol, blood, total parenteral nutrition, or lipid infusion. RESULTS: There were 10 colonized CVCs in the group receiving a set change and 19 in the group not receiving one. This difference was not statistically significant on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. There were 3 cases of catheter-related bacteremia per group. Logistic regression found that burns diagnosis and increased ICU stay significantly predicted colonization.
