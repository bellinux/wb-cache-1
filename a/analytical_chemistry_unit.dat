40|$|<b>Analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{started to}} develop in Croatia as an independ-ent {{scientific}} discipline at the Royal Agricultural and Forestry Col-lege in Kri`evci (1860). Lectures in <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> began at the University of Zagreb in the school year 1875 / 76 within the Uni-versity Institute of <b>Chemistry.</b> Today, <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> is taught as an independent course at eleven university faculties, in Zagreb, Split, Osijek and Rijeka. This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} compulsory contents of basic curricula in <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> in Croatia with the WPAC Eurocurriculum. Scientometric analysis of the Croatian scientific output covered by the Analytical Abstracts shows that during the 1980 – 1996 period Croatian <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> scientists published 442 papers, 89. 6 % of which were also indexed in SCI. Croatian analytical chemists most frequently deal with spectroscopic, chromatographic and elec-troanalytical methods. Distribution of the scientific analytical pub-lications with respect to the number of authors, analytical method used and the number of total and independent citations is graphi-cally presented.

Data from specialized literature show a significant contribution of Brazilian analytical chemists in high impact periodicals and for several areas there is a good adherence among works carried out in Brazil and abroad according to a comparison of studies presented in the 11 th Brazilian Meeting on <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemistry</b> (Campinas, September, 2001) and the XI European Conference on <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemistry</b> (Lisboa, September, 2000). According to the opinion of investigators in this area, there are some topics that require a focused attention for proper evolution.
