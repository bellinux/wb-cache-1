25|$|Delgado's last {{appearance}} as the Master is in Frontier in Space (1973), {{where he works}} alongside the Dalek and Ogron races to provoke a war between the Human and Draconian Empires. The scheme fails, and the Master escapes after he shoots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was thrilling {{to work on}} {{this film}} and when you see my {{extraordinary}} interpretation you realise why I immediately fell into the arms of Jenny Craig, and minor cosmetic surgery.

25|$|The Doctor and the Master both try {{to appeal}} to Azal but for {{opposite}} reasons. The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to kill him. However, Jo, steps {{in front of the}} Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of self-sacrifice does not make sense to Azal, and sends him into a confused rage. The Doctor tells everyone to flee the Church. With Bok also rendered motionless, Azal erupts and the whole Church is blown up. The Master tries to escape but is captured by the UNIT troops and taken away. The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.|$|E

500|$|Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner {{decided to}} create a [...] "mini-episode" [...] to be {{screened}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who Prom in part because actor David Tennant was unable {{to participate in the}} live concert due to his commitments to the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Hamlet.

500|$|Ambrose's family takes {{refuge in}} the TARDIS, but the Doctor, Amy and Rory find {{a crack in the}} cavern wall similar to those they have seen before. The Doctor surmises that the crack was caused by an {{explosion}} in time, which might have left [...] "shrapnel" [...] behind. He reaches in and pulls out an object which he wraps in a handkerchief. Before he can explain, Restac, dying from the toxic exposure, crawls around the corner and fires <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> but Rory pushes him {{out of the way and}} takes the shot, dying in Amy's arms. As the crack begins to absorb Rory's body, the Doctor realises that Rory will be written out of history and forces Amy to board the TARDIS before the drill explodes. He tries to help her concentrate on remembering Rory, but a jolt from the TARDIS causes her to lose concentration and her memories of Rory are lost. The Doctor finds Amy's engagement ring, which Rory had stowed before the events, on the floor of the TARDIS.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{name had}} {{gradually}} been shortened; in Davies's pitch {{it had been}} called Rose meets the Doctor, and the journey begins, on his contract Rose Meets The Doctor, and finally shortened to Rose. Also changed from Davies's original pitch were {{the names of the}} supporting characters: Judy Tyler became Jackie Tyler, and Muggsy Smith became Mickey Smith. Davies had trouble coming up with how Mickey was supposed to be captured by the Nestene while waiting for Rose in the car, and finally realised he could be lured by a plastic wheelie bin. He commented that such instances of the ordinary being made scary made Doctor Who unique. Davies had to take out [...] "oblique" [...] references to the Autons being like terrorists, as the Eye was once a target of a terrorist attack. The entrance of the Doctor was something much debated; Tranter {{and other members of the}} production team wanted it to be more dramatic, but the scene was never reshot. Davies remarked that it reflects Rose's point of view, whereas a more dramatic entrance would reflect the audience's excitement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> coming back. The scene in which the Auton arm attacks in the Tyler's flat was originally much longer, but was revised. The episode originally underran by several minutes, and a scene with the Doctor and Rose walking was added a month or so later.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} the fourteen-episode seventh series on 8 June 2011. [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] was executive produced by Steven Moffat, Piers Wenger and Caroline Skinner. Beth Willis left the BBC and {{stepped down as}} executive producer after series 6 and Wenger also departed following the Christmas special, leaving Moffat and Skinner as executive producers for series 7. Marcus Wilson remained as series producer, with Denise Paul producing [...] "The Bells of Saint John", [...] "The Rings of Akhaten", [...] "Nightmare in Silver" [...] and [...] "The Name of the Doctor". Production of Doctor Who relocated to the new Roath Lock studios in Cardiff midway through production of the series on 12 March 2012; the first episode to be filmed there is the Christmas special in Block Four, with the debut of Coleman's character; however {{it was reported that}} a later episode written by Neil Cross was the first Coleman filmed. Moffat has stated that the introduction of the new companion will [...] " [...] the show a little bit" [...] and [...] "make you look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> differently".|$|E
2500|$|Klieg and Kaftan {{are moved}} into the testing range to keep them {{isolated}} while the others decide on their next course of action. Klieg extricates the weapon from the wall, an X-ray laser he calls a cybergun, to coerce the Cybermen to work for them. The Cybermen release a group of Cybermats into the main chamber and they attack the Doctor, Jamie, Victoria and the expedition members, but the Doctor saves them. Klieg and Kaftan emerge, and Klieg fires the laser <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> He misses, wounding Callum. He opens the hatch, and calls for the Cyber Controller. The Controller appears, accompanied by Toberman, who has been partially cyber-converted and is under the Cyber Controller's control. The Controller moves slowly, as his energy is running low– most of the Cybermen have been ordered back to their tombs to conserve power. Klieg says he will allow the Cyber Controller to be revitalised if the Cybermen help him conquer the Earth, to which the Controller agrees. The Doctor helps the Controller into the sarcophagus {{in an attempt to}} trap it, but the revitalised Controller breaks free. Toberman knocks Klieg unconscious and the Controller retrieves Klieg's cybergun. [...] Kaftan shoots it, but the normal gun has no effect and she is shot by the Controller.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires [...] "a little push" [...] from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, [...] "I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time...". He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed {{for more than three}} hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia {{at the time of his}} [...] "death" [...] could have [...] "destroyed the regenerative process", and that he was [...] "dead too long this time" [...] prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios – in The End of Time – he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and [...] "a new man" [...] walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> and threatens to [...] "put a bullet through both [...] hearts," [...] while in [...] "Forest of the Dead", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In [...] "Turn Left", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world, a UNIT member speculates that what happened to the Doctor [...] "must have happened too fast for him to regenerate" [...] (It is suggested that he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave). In The End of Time, the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.|$|E
