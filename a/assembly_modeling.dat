Then the assem-bly variant design process is formulated as a mixed integer (linear or nonlinear) programming problem which is solved using a standard solver or heuristic.

40|$|In the {{distributed}} and horizontally {{integrated manufacturing}} environment in Agile Manufacturing, {{there is a}} great demand for new product development methods that are capable of generating new cus-tomized assembly designs based on mature component designs that might be dispersed at geographically distributed partner sites. To cater for this demand, this paper addresses the methodology for complex as-sembly variant design in agile manufacturing. It consists of fundamental research in two parts: <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> and assembly variant design methodology. This paper, the first of a two-part series, presents the assembly variant design system architecture and the <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> methodology. First, comple-mentary <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> concept is proposed with two kinds of assembly models, the Hierarchical Assembly Model and the Relational Assembly Model. The first explicitly captures the hierarchical and functional relationships between constituent components while the second explicitly captures the mat-ing relationships at the form feature level. These models are complementary in the sense that each of them models only a specific aspect of assembly related information while together they include required assembly related information. They are further specialized to accommodate the features of assembly variant design. As a result, two kinds of assembly models, the Assembly Variants Model (AVM) and the Assembly Mating Graph (AMG), are generated. These assembly models {{serve as the basis for}} assembly variant design which is discussed in the second part...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{contribution}} {{introduces a}} new framework for <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> in Virtual Reality. Aiming at an easy instructability of the vir-tual environment, the framework provides a task-level interface which directly maps logical assembly commands to corresponding {{changes in the}} geometry scene. For example, the visual assembly of two parts is achieved given only a single command 'connect(a,b) '. This {{is in contrast to}} the <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> style of conventional CAD systems which forces the designer to break down each conceptual assembly task into a series of lower-level subtasks. The proposed framework consists of two parts: (1) A knowledge-based model of connection-sensitive part features (") and the connections between them; and, (2), a set of algorithms that de-ne the task-level interface for assembly, disassembly, and adjustment operations. All algorithms are computationally eÆcient and easily meet the real-time requirements of virtual environments. At the user inter-face, both direct manipulation and directive interfaces, e. g. based on natural language instructions are supported. A family of implemented VR-systems, including CAVE and Internet-based applications, demon-strates the feasibility of the approach. ...|$|E

Two modeling requirements to support assembly design have been discussed: product functional representation and a generic <b>assembly</b> <b>model.</b> Product functions are classified into: service functions, as the formulation of customer's needs; technique functions, as the driving factors of assembly design. A generic <b>assembly</b> <b>model</b> has been proposed {{to support the}} dynamic process of {{the design of the}} product structure. An assembly feature, as a functional carrier, is a generic relationship among modeling entities. Its definition occurs in three levels: functional-, technological- and technical-, in which product functions are gradually transformed into functional form features of parts.

This approach is content based encryption and effective for the secure sharing of feature-based <b>assembly</b> <b>models.</b> In the approach, a classification algorithm for features in an <b>assembly</b> <b>model</b> to be shared or protected during collaboration has been first developed. An encryption algorithm for a feature has been then designed to ensure the parameterization, topological and geometrical validity, and self-adaptability of the encrypted feature. An algorithm for parts with multiple encryption features has been developed. Based on the above algorithms, parts are finally assembled and the geometry and topology of the assembling structure are kept un-changed to enhance collaborators’ interoperability. The characteristics and innovations of the approach include: (1) the approach is feature based, integrative into the main-stream commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems, and flexible to meet various users’ needs for encrypting features selected by users during collaboration, (2) in the approach, the topological and geometrical validity of an <b>assembly</b> <b>model</b> after encryption is maintained to ensure effective collaboration on the assembly, and (3) the approach is parametrically controlled through adjusting position and size parameters so as to ensure the user friendliness of using the approach.
