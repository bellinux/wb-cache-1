30|$|Note {{that since}} our survey was {{performed}} after the M 7.3 <b>aftershock</b> of May 12, 2015, {{it is difficult}} to definitively separate the damage due to the mainshock from that caused by the <b>aftershock.</b> However, at most of the sites the USGS ShakeMap predicts that the strong motion of the mainshock was larger than that of <b>aftershock.</b> On-site interviews with local residents confirmed that most damage was due to the April 25, 2015, mainshock. However, some of the observed damage at easternmost sites close to the May 12 <b>aftershock,</b> such as Bahrabise, may have been caused by the <b>aftershock.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{fault plane}} of the largest <b>aftershock</b> derived {{in the present study}} is located at the {{northern}} end of the <b>aftershock</b> area within 24 hours after the main shock. If the fault {{plane of the}} largest <b>aftershock</b> {{is a part of the}} fault plane of the main shock, the Pacific plate must have moved northwestward during the main shock and southeastward during the largest <b>aftershock.</b> This movement of the Pacific plate seems quite unnatural. Judging from the focal depth and the focal mechanism solution of the main shock, the depth of the fault plane of the main shock is about 20 km in the epicentral area of the largest <b>aftershock,</b> while the focal depth of the largest <b>aftershock</b> determined by JMA is 40 km. Therefore, the fault planes of the two events would be almost parallel to each other.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>aftershocks</b> {{occurred}} at significantly greater depths than the mainshock and {{are dominated by}} strike-slip focal mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Seismic aftershock-hazard {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the first steps toward estab-lishing an integrated risk-based decision-making support framework for emergency management in the event of an ongoing <b>aftershock</b> sequence. This work focuses on providing adaptive daily forecasts of the mean daily rate of exceeding various spectral acceleration values (the <b>aftershock</b> hazard). Two well-established earthquake-occurrence models suitable for daily seismicity forecasts associated with the evolution of an <b>aftershock</b> sequence, namely, the modified Omori’s <b>aftershock</b> model (MO) and the epidemic-type <b>aftershock</b> sequence (ETAS) are adopted. An adaptive and evolution-ary MO-based <b>aftershock</b> occurrence model with distinct spatial and temporal compo-nents is proposed. In this model, the parameters deciding the temporal decay are updated based on the data provided by the ongoing <b>aftershock</b> sequence. This model adopts an evolutionary spatial seismicity pattern loosely based on spatial clustering of <b>aftershock</b> events in the sequence. Bayesian updating is also employed to provide sequence-based parameter estimates for a given ground-motion prediction model. Daily forecasts of the mean rate of exceedance of various spectral acceleration levels are calculated based on alternative occurrence models and the updated ground-motion prediction relation. As a numerical example, daily forecasts of the aftershock-hazard curve are obtained for the L’Aquila <b>aftershock</b> sequence based on the MO-based and ETAS occurrence models, and an updated version of the Sabetta and Pugliese (1996) ground-motion prediction model. These daily hazard forecasts are then compared with the observed daily rates of exceeding various spectral acceleration thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Operative seismic <b>aftershock</b> risk {{forecasting}} {{is particularly}} useful as support for rapid decision-making {{in the presence}} of an ongoing <b>aftershock</b> sequence. Arguably, an oper-ative forecasting framework can be built on the basis of adaptive time-dependent seismic af-tershock risk assessment. In such a context, the fragility curves represent the progressive state of damage in a structure. Focusing on adaptive time- and event-dependent fragility assess-ment, this work explores various issues related to probability-based performance assessment in the immediate post main-shock environment. A fragility curve is expressed herein as the daily probability of (first-excursion) exceeding of a prescribed limit states given the first-mode spectral acceleration. A time-dependent structural performance variable, defined as the ratio of residual demand to residual capacity, is adopted in order to measure the cumulative damage in the structure. The sequence of event-dependent fragility curves are calculated by evolutionary linear logarithmic regression of the structural performance variable versus spectral acceleration, called herein as the sequential cloud method. It is demonstrated that the <b>aftershock</b> recurrence model used to estimate the daily number events of interest signifi-cantly affects the resulting fragility curves. Two alternative <b>aftershock</b> occurrence models based on the ETAS model and the modified Omori are studied herein. The sequence of daily fragility curves for a given limit state are finally integrated together with daily <b>aftershock</b> hazard curves (based on above-mentioned <b>aftershock</b> models) in order to calculate the daily <b>aftershock</b> risk. As a numerical example, the daily <b>aftershock</b> risk is calculated for the L’Aquila 2009 <b>aftershock</b> sequence (central Italy). An equivalent single-degree-of-freedom structure with cyclic strength and stiffness degradation is used in order to evaluate the pro-gressive damage caused by the sequence of <b>aftershock</b> events...|$|R
5|$|More than 3,000 <b>aftershocks</b> were {{reported}} by the Gifu weather observatory in the 14 months following the event.

A deep analysis of the temporal properties of six <b>aftershock</b> sequences occurred in Greece from 1980 to 1997 {{has been carried out}} by means of fractal tools. We performed the Omori’s law, the R/S and the Allan Factor analyses in order to estimate the p-value of the <b>aftershock</b> rate, the Hurst exponent (H) of the interevent-time series, and the spectral exponent (a) respectively. Our results show a significant variability of the p-value from 0. 89 to 1. 48, of H from 0. 78 to 1. 186 and of a from 0. 49 to 1. 44. The variation of the normalized a with the threshold magnitude for all the <b>aftershock</b> sequences examined has displayed almost the same decreasing behaviour. The temporal fractality of <b>aftershock</b> sequences is primarily due to the power-law decay of the <b>aftershock</b> rate. D 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} strong and {{damaging}} <b>aftershocks</b> persisted for about three-and-a-half months. The {{largest in the}} sequence came on May 8. The event caused additional destruction to the northeast of the initial meizoseismal area. Qatur, which had been nearly destroyed by the mainshock, took another serious hit. Other villages (Chaliyan, Givaran, Mir 'Umar, and Ravyan) also experienced major destruction. Shikaryazi was a village in the southeast region {{that had not been}} seriously affected by the mainshock, but experienced heavy damage during the May 8 event. This shock resulted in four additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|After <b>aftershocks</b> {{from the}} quake had concluded, {{examination}} took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events.

For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{compare the}} ability of three <b>aftershock</b> decay models {{proposed}} in the literature to reproduce the behavior of 24 real <b>aftershock</b> sequences of Southern California and Italy. In particular, we consider the Modified Omori Model (MOM), the Modified Stretched Exponential model (MSE) and the band Limited Power Law (LPL). We show that, if the background rate is modeled properly, the MSE or the LPL reproduce the <b>aftershock</b> rate decay generally better than the MOM and are preferable, {{on the basis of}} the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, for about one half of the sequences. In particular the LPL, which is usually preferable with respect to the MSE and fits well the data of most sequences, might represent a valid alternative to the MOM in real-time forecasts of <b>aftershock</b> probabilities. We also show that the LPL generally fits the data better than a purely empirical formula equivalent to the <b>aftershock</b> rate equation predicted by the rate- and state- dependent friction model. This indicates that the emergence of a negative exponential decay at long times is a general property of many <b>aftershock</b> sequences but also that the process of <b>aftershock</b> generation is not fully described by current physical models...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} global {{variations in}} the pattern of <b>aftershock</b> area expansion associated with large subduction zone earthquakes. The expansion of <b>aftershock</b> areas with time is relatively small in the subduction zones of Alaska, the Aleutians, Mexico, and parts of the Kuriles and South America. These subduction zones are interpreted to be characterized by moderate to strong interplate coupling. In contrast, the extent of <b>aftershock</b> expansion is greater for events within the subduction zones of northeast Japan and western and south Pacific where interplate coupling is inferred to be weak. These results are interpreted in terms of an asperity model where a fault zone is represented by a distribution of strong spots (asperities) and weaker zones. The immediate <b>aftershock</b> area is assumed to extend over an area occupied by asperities, and the subsequent expansion to occur into the surrounding weaker zones. If large asperities abut each other on a fault plane, interplate coupling is strong and little expansion of <b>aftershock</b> area occurs. Smaller and more sparsely distributed asperities cause weak interplate coupling and significant expansion of <b>aftershock</b> area. Small and densely distributed asperities result in moderate interplate coupling and little <b>aftershock</b> expansion...|$|R
40|$|The largest aftershock（Mw 7. 3 ）of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake（Mw 8. 3 ）generates larger peak ground acceleration（PGA）values {{than the}} main shock {{in the western}} side of the epicenters despite their {{magnitude}} difference. We study the features of strong ground motions from the largest <b>aftershock</b> in detail using PGA values. Spatial distribution maps of PGA ratio between the largest <b>aftershock</b> and adjacent earthquake shows obvious azimuth dependency compared with the other earthquake pairs occurring around Japan. Attenuation relationship of the largest <b>aftershock</b> shows a large azimuth-dependent scattering at distances from 200 to 300 km compared with three smaller earthquakes occurring around the largest <b>aftershock.</b> Because this large scattering appears only in the largest <b>aftershock,</b> we conclude that the azimuth dependency is a peculiar feature of the largest <b>aftershock.</b> Fourier spectral ratios between the largest <b>aftershock</b> and adjacent earthquake at several stations show azimuth dependency at higher frequencies than 1 Hz, which is consistent with the azimuth dependency of PGA values. The azimuth dependency in high-frequency range cannot be explained simply by the source and path effects, and therefore, we make a hypothesis that the azimuth dependency is an apparent one generated by two earthquakes occurring simultaneously at different regions. Synthetic PGA distributions generated by two simultaneous events calculated by the empirical attenuation relationship are in agreement with the observed PGA distribution of the largest <b>aftershock...</b>|$|R
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced {{by far the}} strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering {{a large number of}} <b>aftershocks.</b> Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event has led to the discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions.
