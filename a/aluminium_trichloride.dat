5|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{by a huge}} margin {{the most}} common chlorine compound, {{and it is the}} main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as chlorinated methanes and ethanes, vinyl chloride and its polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC), <b>aluminium</b> <b>trichloride</b> for catalysis, the chlorides of magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium which are the precursors for producing the pure elements, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of <b>aluminium</b> <b>trichloride</b> in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

The acetal generated esters with benzoyl bromide and aluminium chloride while ring chloro substituted ester with N-chlorosuccinimide. The acetal produced ether with p-chlorobenzyl chloride, but only aldehyde with phosphorous trichloride, and phosphorous oxychloride. Interestingly, the acetal yielded substituted aldehyde alone with titanium oxychloride. Organic and inorganic halocompounds are synthetically very useful reagents and vary widely in their acceptor synthon character and reactivity; hence their application {{in the present}} work on the action of halocompounds on benzaldehyde di-n-butylacetal is a new venture...|$|R
