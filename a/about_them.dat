5|$|The OA {{has been}} criticized for {{cultural}} appropriation with regard to conducting simulated Native American ceremonies, with critics viewing these ceremonies as marginalizing Native Americans and reinforcing stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among evangelical Christians, {{the five}} men are {{commonly}} considered martyrs and missionary heroes. Books {{have been written}} <b>about</b> <b>them</b> by numerous biographers, most notably Elisabeth Elliot. Anniversaries of their deaths have been accompanied by stories in major Christian publications, and their story, {{as well as the}} subsequent acceptance of Christianity among the Huaorani, has been turned into several motion pictures.|$|E

5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} {{objects in the}} Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) are listed as dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt objects are {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most of them will probably qualify when more is known <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} <b>about</b> <b>them</b> {{due to the lack}} of detailed records.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, players uncover clues about the D'ni, an ancient civilization, and the archeological group {{dedicated}} to learning more <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> the D'ni Restoration Council. Aspects of the D'ni civilization such as social structure, marriage, and how Ages came about are also imparted as players progress through the Ages. Players may collect Relto pages, which offer cosmetic customization to the player's personal Age—for example, making it rain or adding a waterfall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say," [...] {{answered}} Sam, {{with something}} of peevishness; [...] "losses is losses: there's no use talking <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> when they're over and paid." ...|$|R

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the voyage}} across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops {{and others on}} board the Espagne and wrote news stories <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and about the threat of torpedo attacks. In France, she {{gathered}} most of her material {{well away from the}} Western Front, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{most likely}} {{made their way}} to the West via the Silk Route and {{maritime}} trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Huhh!' cried Una. 'Hobden always 'tends to his wires before breakfast. He {{puts his}} rabbits into the faggots he's {{allowed to take}} home. He'll tell us <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> tomorrow.' ...|$|R

5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E
5|$|The {{block and}} article were controversial, {{generating}} articles on other websites <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> {{and the broader}} issue of advertising ethics. Readers of Ars Technica generally followed Fisher's persuasion; {{the day after his}} article was published, 25,000 readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on Ars Technica in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier.|$|E
5|$|The film's title {{comes from}} the fictional S video series {{directed}} by Rost. In the videos, Rost stalks women {{for a long time}} and, after learning <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> he asks them {{if they want to be}} a part of his films. All of the videos are first person with no dialogue. The film references other films, including Peeping Tom, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, , Kill the Scream Queen, and The Crucifier.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, those teeth," [...] said Hooper, and {{his hand}} went to his {{waistcoat}} pocket once more. [...] "Permanent things false teeth are. You read <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> in all the murder trials." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if one mustn't have 'em, {{why should}} one know <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> and be worried by them? If {{she comes to}} do {{mischief}}, why shouldn't she do mischief without making me an accomplice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Flip, coolly, [...] "if you're not claimin' 'em for yourself, and {{you hear}} father say they ain't his, I reckon the less {{you have to say}} <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> the better." ...|$|R
5|$|The four {{released}} {{their debut}} full-length studio album, Something About Airplanes, on August 18, 1998. The album was favorably reviewed {{in the independent}} music scene. In 1998 the band also met their long-term manager Jordan Kurland. Kurland had heard good things <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> and after a failed attempt to see them play at South By Southwest finally hooked up with them when touring with his then client, the band Crumb.|$|E
5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>them</b> lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything <b>about</b> <b>them</b> being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E

6000|$|... 'In the Channel, I guess. There {{was nothing}} in the papers <b>about</b> <b>'em.</b> Shall we go into the drawin'-room, and see what these boys and girls are doin?' But say, ain't life in England interestin'? ...|$|R
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E
5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Toby, rather carelessly. [...] "I don't {{know much}} <b>about</b> <b>'em,</b> an' Uncle Dan'l says they don't {{know much about}} me. Here's another bad nut; goin' to give me two more?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I hate dreams. When I dreams <b>'em</b> they're always <b>about</b> bobbies and maginstrates, an' wittles, an' {{when other}} fellows tells <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> they're so long-winded an' prosy. But I {{had a dream}} too. What was yours?" ...|$|R
