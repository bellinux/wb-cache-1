40|$|A 63 -year-old man was {{admitted}} with newly developed left hemiparesis. He had experienced left hemiparesis that had resulted from <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>right</b> thalamic hemorrhage. Diffusion-weighted images showed only high signal intensity lesion {{in the left}} internal capsule.

40|$|Introduction: How do ERPs {{reflecting}} auditory {{information processing}} develop across adolescence? This development is described for the amplitude and latency of five ERP components and four difference-waves in four groups of 11 healthy subjects with mean ages of 10, 14, 17 & 21 years. Methods: Vector normalised data were recorded from 19 sites during diffuse and focused attention in a three-tone oddball. (i. e. in passive, diffuse-attention and active, focussed-attention, discrimination conditions) {{to see how}} ERP loci varied with age for tone-type, attention-condition and for four types of difference-wave reflecting nontarget and target comparisons: (mismatch negativity, MMN, an auditory working memory trace; Negative difference, Nd, an attentional trace, but also Processing Negativity, PN and the Goodin-waveform). Results: Age interacted with site for most components. P 1 loci sensitive to rare tones moved posteriorly and N 1 loci lost their right bias at early puberty. But P 2 loci did not move anterior to Cz until adulthood. N 2 amplitude, sensitive to attention condition, developed a mature frontal focus by 17 years. Right-biased P 3 loci move to the midline with focused attention in young and old alike. Difference-waves reflected three developmental stages (figure 2) : In 10 year-olds early deflections (< 150 ms) were diffusely distributed; in mid-adolescence the main frontal negative component (150 - 300 ms) became well-formed and lost <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>right</b> bias; over 17 years the late positive complex developed a right bias in target-derived waves. Latency decreases for early frontal components were marked in 10 - 14 y olds and for later posterior components in 14 - 17 y olds. MMN topography matured (from a right lateral to bilateral distribution) between 10 and 14 y, while Nd topography matured and became bilateral between 14 and 17 y. Conclusions: Major developments of brain function appear {{at the onset of}} adolescence (< 14 y) in early stimulus-selection processes and during adolescence in the differential use of this information (N 2 - and P 3 -like latencies...|$|E

40|$|During {{listening}} to a musical piece, unexpected harmonies may evoke brain responses that are reflected electrically as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity (ERAN) and a late frontal negativity (N 5). In the present study we demonstrate that these components of the event-related potential can be evoked preattentively, that is, even when a musical stimulus is ignored. Both ERAN and N 5 differed in amplitude {{as a function of}} music-theoretical principles. Participants had no special musical expertise; results thus provide evidence for an automatic processing of musical information in onmusicians. ...|$|R

40|$|Event-related brain {{potentials}} {{in response}} to harmonically inappropriate chords were compared for musical experts and novices. Similar to previous studies, these chords elicited <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity (ERAN). The amplitude of the ERAN was clearly larger for musical experts than for novices, presumably because experts had more specific musical expectancies than novices. Chords with a physically deviant timbre elicited a mismatch negativity that did not differentiate the groups, indicating that the larger ERAN in experts was not due to a general enhanced auditory sensitivity. The ERAN reflects fast and automatic neural mechanisms that process complex musical (music-syntactic) irregularities, and the present results indicate that these mechanisms can be modulated by expertise...|$|R
