The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades.

Tetramethylammonium hydroxide(TMAH) /methanol was employed as alternative. Standard triglycerides were hydrolyzed with 1 M KOH/ethanol and 1 M TMAH/methanol, respectively and fatty <b>acid</b> <b>recoveries</b> were determined in three different derivatives, methyl ester, trimethylsilyl(TMS) and N(O) -tert-butyldimethylsilyl(tBDMSi) derivatives. The <b>recoveries</b> of fatty <b>acids</b> from standard triglycerides with TMAH hydrolysis were higher from 1. 3 to 65 times than those of KOH hydrolysis. Fatty <b>acid</b> <b>recoveries</b> from the sample lipids, beef tallow, corn oil and tuna eyeball oil, also showed same results as standard triglycerides. The fatty acid composition of the sample lipids determined by TMAH bydrolysis showed close values with the values from the A. O. A. C. method regardless of derivatizatin methods. But in the case of KOH hydrolysis the fatty acid compositions showed significantly different values among the derivatives and from those of the A. O. A. C. method. In the KOH hydrolysis, the precision of the data obtained form recoveries or compositions of fatty acid were very poor compared to TMAH hydrolysis. In the extraction steps of hydrolyzed fatty acids on the case of KOH hydrolysis, substantial amount of fatty acid were simultaneously removed by the extraction with diethyl ether for removal of nonsuponifiable materials. When the hydrolyzed fatty acids after the extraction of nonsaponifiable materials extracted with hexane, significantly small amount were extracted compared to TMAH hydrolysis. The total amounts of fatty acids recovered from the residues of each layer in the extraction steps, such as diethyl ether layer for the removal of nonsaponifiable materials, hexane layer extracted fatty acids and the water layer remained after extraction of hydrolyzed fatty acids, were significantly higher in the case of TMAH hydrolysis than those of KOH hydrolysis...|$|R
