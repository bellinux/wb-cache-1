50|$|Accessories for the OM-4 {{included}} all the Olympus motor drives {{made for the}} OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized film rewind. The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the {{hospital}} dramatically continued {{to improve and}} expand its facilities. This included the provision of emergency lighting, a staff canteen and improvements to staff accommodation. Also a new Pharmacy, which allowed the overrun Outpatient and Casualty Department to be separated into two distinct departments. In 1963 saw the improvements and extensions to the theatre facilities and a new mortuary refrigeration unit was built. While in 1966 an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> processing unit {{was added to the}} X-ray Department.|$|R
5000|$|Most film-based point-and-shoots {{made after}} the late 1980s use 35mm film. In the 1980s, 35mm {{was seen as}} a [...] "professional" [...] format due to the {{relative}} difficulty of loading and rewinding the film versus cartridge based formats such as 110 or disc film. The key innovations that made 35mm point-and-shoot cameras possible were <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> loading and <b>automatic</b> advance and rewind. Advanced Photo System film was mildly popular in the 1990s. 126 film was also popular during the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|A motor drive, in {{the field}} of photography, is a powered film {{transport}} mechanism. Historically, film loading, advancing, and rewinding were all manually driven functions. The desires of professional photographers for more efficient shooting, particularly in sports and wildlife photography, and the desires of amateur and novice photographers for easier to use cameras both drove the development of <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> transport. Some early developments were made with clockwork drives, but most development {{in the field}} has been in the direction of electrically driven transport.|$|R

The FA can also utilize the Nikon MD-12 motor drive of the Nikon FM and Nikon FE series, but the unit will not provide power for the FA.|$|R
40|$|Disfluent speech {{synthesis}} {{is necessary in}} some applications such as <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> dubbing or spoken translation. This paper presents {{a model for the}} generation of synthetic disfluent speech based on inserting each element of a disfluency in a context where they can be considered fluent. Prosody obtained by the application of standard techniques on these new sentences is used for the synthesis of the disfluent sentence. In addition, local modifications are applied to segmental units adjacent to disfluency elements. Experiments evidence that duration follows this behavior, what supports the feasibility of the model. Index Terms: {{speech synthesis}}, disfluent speech, prosody, disfluencies. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to obtain photographs of the lunar surface as the spacecraft flew by the Moon. The imaging system was designated Yenisey-2 and consisted of a dual-lens camera AFA-E1, an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> processing unit, and a scanner. The lenses on the camera were a 200 mm focal length, f/5.6 aperture objective and a 500 mm, f/9.5 objective. The camera carried 40 frames of temperature- and radiation-resistant 35 mm isochrome film. The 200 mm objective could image the full disk of the Moon and the 500 mm could take {{an image of a}} region on the surface. The camera was fixed in the spacecraft and pointing was achieved by rotating the craft itself.|$|R

40|$|The cost {{of human}} {{operation}} is a bottleneck in {{the restoration of}} large quantities of archive films. Eliminating the vibration of a degraded image makes a difficulty in an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> restoration system. The vibration is usually caused by improper film transportation during the recording, copying or the digitization process. We have developed an automatic method for image stabilization consisting of two main steps: estimating vibration then correction by drifting and rotating the whole frame. Earlier stabilization algorithms are unsuccessful in cases of multiple motions and human interaction with manual ROF (Region of Fixation) selection is needed. In contrast, the proposed method, {{which is based on}} multi-scale motion estimation, automatically selects the ROF required for the stabilization of noisy films. 1...|$|R
50|$|The camera′s {{capacity}} is 100 ft. A 400-ft magazine (on the Rex 5 - or converted Rex 3 or 4) can {{be attached to}} the top of the camera. From the beginning it offered <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> threading, a clutch for disengaging the drive spring in order to crank the film by hand forward and backwards unlimited, and a cut-off turret disc that is not wider than the camera body in center position. Stepless speed control was available between 8 and 64 frames per second. Early cameras have a 190 degrees opening angle shutter. A few years after their introduction the H cameras could be equipped with an accurate single-frame counter. That accessory was incorporated into all H camera models since 1946.|$|R
50|$|First {{produced}} in 1962, the Agfa Optima 1a {{was one of}} the first fully <b>automatic</b> 35mm <b>film</b> cameras. The successor to German camera manufacturer Agfa's Optima 1 camera, the camera employed a selenium cell, which provided the power required to read the light level for the automatic calculation of aperture and shutter speed.|$|R
25|$|Goldhaber was in {{high demand}} as a speaker at {{scientific}} conferences due to her mastery of her field, and her ability to express herself beautifully. Goldhaber gave a seminal talk at the 1965 Rochester Conference that marked the transition from cosmic ray based experiments to particle accelerator base experiments {{in the study of}} strange particles. In the fall of 1965 the Goldhabers took a sabbatical to travel around the world visiting high energy laboratories and giving lectures. They first stopped at Oxford for the biennial European conference on high energy physics, and then CERN so that Goldhaber could discuss methods of making <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> measurements with Berkeley's Hough-Powell device. The Goldhabers then traveled to Ankara to lecture, and spent a month at the Weizmann Institute in preparation for the lectures Sulamith was to give in Madras, India.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an application}} called Metascore {{that provides a}} visual interface for the control and synchronising of parameters for generative film music scores. Metascore {{is part of a}} project under development at the Australasian CRC for Interaction Design (ACID), the aim of which is to create a real-time <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> scoring system. Metascore allows the user to compose music, using high-level descriptions of compositional intent, in synchronisation with video. Metascore allows control of constant parameters within sections that demarcate film cues, and control of continually varying parameters through free-form break point envelopes. Parameter values in Metascore can themselves be expressions or functions, enabling extensive flexibility for adaptive control of the algorithmic score. This paper will describe the Metascore interface design and illustrate its use in the context of producing an orchestral score for a documentary film. Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The F-501 is a 35 mm single-lens {{reflex camera}} with <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> loading and advance, almost {{a first for}} Nikon (the F-301 was their first SLR to feature this). The {{built-in}} motor drive provides single (one exposure and frame advance per shutter button press) or continuous (shutter will fire and film will advance {{so long as the}} shutter button is depressed) modes. Maximum film advance speed is 2.5 frames per second (frame/s) on continuous mode, but can be as slow as 1.4 frames/s depending on the status of the focus/exposure locks. Rewind is accomplished manually by a familiar rewind knob which doubled as a release for the back. The F-501 is powered by four AAA batteries housed {{in the bottom of the}} camera body, although it can utilize AA sized batteries with an optional attachment (MB-3).|$|R
50|$|Major {{accessories}} for the F2 {{included the}} Nikon MD-1 (introduced in 1971) and MD-2 (1973) motor drives, providing <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a Nikon MB-1 battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two Nikon MS-1 battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate {{required that the}} F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum advance rate is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.|$|R
50|$|The Genesis camera family {{consisted}} of 4 models (see table below), each new model replacing the previous one. All models had a fixed zoom, motorized stepless autofocus, autoexposure, a built-in pop-up flash, motorized <b>film</b> transport, and <b>automatic</b> (DX) <b>film</b> sensing. The first two releases had fairly boxy designs; {{the latter two}} were given a sleeker, more rounded look.|$|R
30|$|Electrochemical {{tests were}} {{performed}} by coin-type 2032 cells (Shenzhen Kejingstar Technology Co. Ltd., People’s Republic of China) which were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (MBRAUN, Germany) with oxygen and moisture contents {{of less than}} 0.1  ppm. For preparing the working electrode, a slurry mixture of prepared active materials, carbon black, and sodium alginate in a weight ratio of 6 : 2 : 2 in water was coated on a copper (Cu) foil by an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> applicator (AFA-II, Shanghai Pushen Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd., People’s Republic of China). The Cu foil was dried at 70  °C for 12  h and then cut into pieces with a diameter (ϕ) of 14  mm. The loading of active material was ~ 0.42  mg cm− 2. Subsequently, the pieces were dried at 110  °C for 6  h in vacuum. A solution of 1  M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1 [*]v/v) was served as electrolyte.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the 18-year-old {{photographer}} Martin Hanke {{founded the}} Hamaphot KG (limited partnership) in Dresden which specialized in photo accessories. When Dresden was bombarded in the Second World War, {{the company was}} destroyed. It was rebuilt in Monheim in 1945. In 1958, the first synchronized flash powder device was presented, in 1972 the world’s first <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> splicer. Three years later, the “Hamafix” slide mounting system came onto the market. In 1990, Hama established their UK branch Hama PVAC Ltd. (Hama Photo, Video, Audio, Communications) and are UK distributor for Celestron, Tasco, Sandisk, Vivitar and Koss products. In 1991, Hama launched the “Videocut 200” which - according to company representatives - was the most frequently sold video editing device in Europe at that time. In 1993, the company name changed from Hamaphot to Hama. Two years later, the “MobileSafe” mobile phone holder {{was put on the}} market. In 1998, the company celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary.|$|R
50|$|The A-1 accepts any lens {{with the}} Canon FD breech lock mount ({{introduced}} in 1971) or Canon New FD pseudo-bayonet mount (sometimes called the FDn mount, introduced 1979). It {{can also use}} most earlier FL lenses and some even older R (or Canomatic) series lenses, albeit with reduced functionality. This excludes all of Canon's EF bayonet mount autofocus lenses (introduced in 1987). During the late 1970s and 1980s, there were approximately 55 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a 7.5mm f/5.6 fisheye to an FD 800mm f/5.6 telephoto, and included lenses with maximum apertures to f/1.2 and a line of L-series lenses of exceptional quality. Accessories for the A-1 included the Canon motor drive MA (<b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> advance up to 5 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlight 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) and Canon Speedlight 199A (guide number 98/30 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) electronic flashes.|$|R
