5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. <b>After</b> <b>controlling</b> for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. <b>After</b> <b>controlling</b> the ball, Larsson made a left footed return pass to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control the ball with his left foot. He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E

Techniques of data analysis is done by comparing the costs at the time of planning with the actual costs. After that in comparison between the cost of production before controlling the cost of production <b>after</b> <b>control.</b> From the comparison of the costs before and <b>after</b> the <b>control</b> in 2012, it is known that for the cost of materials and direct labor costs are efficient, whereas for factory overhead costs relatively inefficient because there are several components of overhead costs that are far from the budgeted cost. While the results of the calculation of the cost of production before and <b>after</b> <b>control</b> of production, there is a difference of Rp. 22. 000 /m 3. It can be concluded that the control of production is done by BSP Waru plant can improve the efficiency of production costs which will directly affect the cost of production...|$|R

5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, <b>after</b> <b>controlling</b> for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|The land {{offensive}} {{began on}} July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A.

The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead on their side, and four on the American side. The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island's interior. They engaged in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares.|$|E
