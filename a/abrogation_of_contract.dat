An extraordinary uncertainty has been created when {{the most powerful man in}} the world can rewrite contracts and choose winners and losers in private negotiations as he sees fit. Since this is an unquantifiable uncertainty, and not a quantifiable risk, its effect on business and investor confidence will be large and unpredictable. As in the 1930s, a time when government also cavalierly rewrote private contracts, the prudent approach for business will be to invest minimally and wait for another administration." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{provision}} {{of natural gas}} to the Ideal Cement plant was also {{the subject of a}} prior Supreme Court case, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956). The issue in that case was whether United Gas could increase the contract rate for natural gas to the cement plant by unilaterally filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission. The Supreme Court in that case held that the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) did not authorize the <b>abrogation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> so the new rate schedule could not change the rate for the gas for the cement plant. This case, along with Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956) established the Mobile-Sierra doctrine in U.S. administrative law, which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be [...] "just and reasonable" [...] and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act.|$|R

50|$|The {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Harlan {{noted that there}} was no allegation that the NGA was unconstitutional, so the only issue in the case involved the statutory interpretation of the NGA. The opinion stated that the provision in the NGA requiring the filing of rate schedules was not a rate setting procedure, but a prerequisite to the establishment of new rates. While the NGArequired a gas company to file new rates and contracts with the FPC, it did not authorize the <b>abrogation</b> <b>of</b> any <b>contract</b> in effect. The FPC could investigate rates in contracts, but contracts could be modified or rejected by the FPC only if the rate in the contract was found to be so low as to be harmful to third parties and not in the public interest. Thus, a gas company had no authority to unilaterally change a rate in a contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2008, severe water {{shortages}} in Accra were reported, leading the Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing to review whether AVRL {{was working in}} compliance with the management contract. However, he explained that the reason for the shortages were unforeseen power outages at two water treatment plants in Weija and Kpong. According to the Minister, the overall situation would improve notably by the end of 2008 due to several new boreholes and a more stable power supply. In March 2008 the National Coalition Against Privatisation of Water (NCAP) called for the <b>abrogation</b> <b>of</b> the management <b>contract</b> for alleged [...] "lack of performance", especially related to the lack of achievement of “Service Standards” for pressure and flow as determined in Schedule 4 <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> The Minister responded by pointing to an upcoming mid-term review.|$|R
