5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia usually waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> is stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} yellow fever was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes infected with T. cruzi by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E

When a group of soldiers arrive the next morning, Torrance is dead.|$|E

5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5|$|The fore gut of {{some species}} extends the whole {{length of the}} insect {{and can be used}} to store prey for {{digestion}} later.

When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>insect</b> {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. <b>An</b> <b>insect</b> molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck.

The pruinescence is commonly white to pale blue in color, but can also be gray, pink, purple, or red; these colors may be produced by Tyndall scattering of light. When pale in color, pruinescence often strongly reflects ultraviolet.|$|R
50|$|Verifying <b>an</b> <b>insect's</b> {{death from}} {{chemical}} injections is difficult, so it's often recommended {{to follow up}} anesthetic overdose with physical destruction. Note that since insects have different nervous systems from vertebrates, decapitation alone {{may not always be}} sufficient to destroy neural function.|$|R
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of <b>an</b> <b>insect,</b> and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} <b>an</b> <b>insect</b> host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
50|$|Zoophthora species parasitize insects, {{using their}} host’s {{body as a}} source of {{nutrition}} and as a site for reproduction. In order to infect <b>a</b> potential <b>insect</b> host, fungal tissue (generally as uninucleate or coenocytic hypha) must first penetrate the insect’s cuticle. Upon entering <b>an</b> <b>insect’s</b> body, some Zoophthora species are able to lose their cell walls and exist as protoplasts; this phenomenon is common in many taxa in the Entomophthorales, and is believed to help the fungus evade its host’s immune responses.|$|R
