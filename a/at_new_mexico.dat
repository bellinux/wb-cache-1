25|$|Since 2004, several {{researchers}} at Oregon State University's (OSU) College of Forestry have researched {{various aspects of}} Christmas tree cultivation. In the Department of Forest Resources, Rick Fletcher is researching Christmas tree genetics, fertilization and disease management, while Chad Landgren is concentrating his emphasis on Christmas tree genetics and disease management. Both men are doing their research in the Silviculture and Ecology Section of the department. In OSU's Department of Forest Science, Mike Bondi is conducting ongoing research into Christmas tree fertilization, productivity and genetics, as well as natural and artificial regeneration systems. During the mid-1990s, the trio's research was primarily focused on creating better Christmas tree seed stock, resulting in {{a higher percentage of}} quality mature trees, through genetic improvements. Similar research has been conducted by the Agricultural Experiment Station <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University.|$|E
25|$|The season it {{all came}} {{together}} for the Runnin’ Rebels was 1989–90. Future NBA star Larry Johnson transferred from Odessa College, joining Greg Anthony, Stacey Augmon, David Butler and Anderson Hunt. The Rebels began the season ranked No. 1 in almost every poll and rolled through the competition. UNLV suffered a surprising loss <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State and finished the season as co–champions of the Big West Conference. However, Johnson and Co. flexed their muscles in the Big West Tournament, running away with the title and the No. 1 seed in the West Region. In NCAA Tournament play, the Rebels toughest game came {{in the third round}} at Oakland, Calif., when Ball State hung tough before falling 69–67. UNLV also ended Loyola Marymount’s Cinderella season with a 131–101 thrashing in the regional final. The win set up a semifinal match with Georgia Tech at McNichols Arena in Denver. Trailing by seven at the half, UNLV rallied for an 89–80 triumph and a date in the championship. The 1990 NCAA Championship was all UNLV as an 18–0 run midway through the second half sent Duke reeling as the Rebels ran up the most lopsided victory in championship history, 103–73. Hunt was named Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four for his performance as the Rebels finished the season 35–5. The squad was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Stirling Colgate, a {{professor}} <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> Tech, {{wrote a letter}} to Science proposing salvaging MAR. He felt that after minor re-tuning it would make an excellent radio astronomy instrument for observing the hydrogen line. Colgate's suggestion was never adopted, but over 2000 of the Western Electric parametric amplifiers driving the system ended up being salvaged by the university. About a dozen of these found their way into the astronomy field, including Colgate's supernova detector, SNORT. About 2,000 remained in storage <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> Tech until 1980. An assay at that time discovered that there was well over one ounce of gold in each one, and the remaining stocks were melted down to produce $941,966 for the university ($ million in [...] ). The money was used to build a new wing on the university's Workman Center, known unofficially as the [...] "Gold Building".|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald, English and children's {{literature}} professor <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University, agrees, {{writing in}} Beatrix Potter that Miss Moppet demonstrates Potter's ability to pare text and illustrations to essentials noting that she worked best with more complicated plots, more complicated characters, and stories with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. [...] Miss Moppet is a vignette, she indicates, {{rather than the}} typical Potter tale of causality, extended plot, and variety of character, and depends upon the archetypal animosity between cat and mouse with the cat being the dominant character.|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald, Professor of English <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter points out that {{although}} Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in Jeremy Fisher. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, {{as evidenced by the}} careful observation in the illustrations. Jeremy Fisher was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, and the pictures appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, [...] "Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success".|$|E

500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald, Professor of English <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter (1986), observes that the {{depiction}} of domestic discord in Timmy Tiptoes is not typical for Potter or for children's literature of the period. She considers the marital relationship between the chipmunks [...] "abrasive and shocking". Though their relationship may reflect the non-monogamous mating habits of eastern chipmunks and offer a contrast with the happy pairing of Timmy and Goody, it is an obstacle {{in the flow of}} the tale. The reader is forced to turn his attention from the star of the book to a secondary player, and, while Timmy's story ends with the hero happily reunited with his wife, the reunion dealt the chipmunks is uncertain and less satisfying than that granted Timmy and Goody.|$|E
500|$|Craig Delancey, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York, {{cited the}} {{conclusion}} of [...] "Acrobat" [...] {{as an example of}} how rock music can be [...] "profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition." [...] He noted that [...] "the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless." [...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald, Professor of English <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State University, past {{president}} of the Children's Literature Association, and author of Beatrix Potter (1986), views the plot of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle as [...] "thin" [...] and lacking the complications of Potter's previously published The Tale of Two Bad Mice (1905) and later books. The tale is held together, she asserts, by its attractive central character, and points out that, like many girls' books of the period, it is set indoors and revolves around household chores and duties. Unlike Two Bad Mice however, there is no ironic commentary on housekeeping; Potter gives her tacit approval to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's spic and span cottage and her housekeeping practices. [...] MacDonald points out that Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is the first of Potter's books to depict a countryside of simple dwellings, pathways, stone fences, and the timeless, unchanging ways of rural life. Actual place names in the tale such as Skelghyl, Garthsgate, and Little-town ground the tale in a real world locality yet the tale is mythologized by suggesting a remote time before mechanical means of doing laundry had been invented. She notes that Mrs. Tiggy-winkle has become [...] "synonymous for female hedgehogs and for fastidious housekeepers".|$|E
