5000|$|... 1. The calcaneal {{internal}} rotation (adduction) and plantar flexion {{is the key}} deformity. The foot is adducted and plantar-flexed at the subtalar joint, and {{the goal is to}} <b>abduct</b> the foot and dorsiflex it. In order to achieve correction of the clubfoot, the calcaneus should be allowed to rotate freely under the talus bone, which also is free to rotate in the ankle mortise. The correction takes place through the normal arc of the subtalar joint. This is achieved by placing the index finger of the operator on the medial malleolus to stabilize the leg and levering on the thumb placed on the lateral aspect head of the talus while <b>abducting</b> the forefoot in supination. Forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by <b>abducting</b> the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the calcaneocuboid joint prevents the calcaneus from <b>abducting</b> and therefore everting.|$|R
