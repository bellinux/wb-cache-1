5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if there is a difference in the way male and female authors of contemporary realistic fiction for young adults portray decision making by their male or female protagonists. Questions asked in the study were: (1) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? (2) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? (3) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? and (4) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? Content analysis was used as the method of collecting data. The sample consisted of 194 novels written from 1989 to 1998, 53 of which contained a moral dilemma. A discussion of the novels included examples of moral dilemmas, alternative solutions, dilemma resolutions, and resolutions based upon care or justice. Analysis of the data revealed: (1) Female writers employ <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care and <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making. (2) Female writers prefer <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making. (3) Male writers prefer <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making. (4) Male writers prefer <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice for female protagonists involved in moral decision making...|$|R

5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio filed <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

40|$|Challenging gender {{injustice}} {{is not an}} {{easy task}} {{especially when it comes to}} the injustices that are present in the family. Part of the difficulty is that moral and political theory has tended to take what happens in the home as irrelevant to justice. In referencing various feminist philosophers I will critically assess the nature of the injustices that take place in the family and focus on these injustices as they are present in Western liberal societies. In the process of determining how women can be elevated from their positions of inequality in the family, I will critically examine the benefits of using <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice to address these issues of inequality. To begin my analysis I make use of John Rawls’ theory of justice and examine how, if at all, his theory can be applied to the family structure. My thesis proceeds by examining Susan Okin’s critique of Rawls and her account of how justice should be incorporated into the family. I then outline various accounts introduced by feminist philosophers such as Sarah Ruddick and Joan Tronto who favor using either <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of justice or <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care for challenging gender injustice in the home. My thesis offers a critique of these theories and it concludes by arguing that <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of care is best suited for addressing issues of gender injustice in the home...|$|R

In the decade of the eighties two blueprints for development, the Brandt and Brundtland RePc) rts, were published with the intention of providing states with a development program. These reports propose remarkably similar solutions to the world's development problems. However, the underlying ethic which could be used to guide the proposals is dissimilar. The Brandt RePOrt is Predicated upon <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of rights and obligations to others, while the Brundtiand Report ethic is based upon C n interests. In neither report is the underlying ethic developed. Beginning with these two reports can we construct <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> which could guide state sponsored development policy? A number of contemporary writers on development construct theories which could be used to support the ethic of Brandt, and be applied to state sponsored development. The neo-Kantian ethics of Gewirth, Shue and O'Neill provide examples of such <b>an</b> <b>ethic.</b> However, <b>a</b> deontic ethic- designed for governing interpersonal relations- is not easily extendable to governmental bodies constrained by rather strict mandates. Attempting to formulate <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> to govern state sponsored development through theories of justice, such as those proposed by Beitz and Pogge, is also problematic. The constraints of iv a deontic ethic- designed for governing interpersonal relations- is not easily extendable to governmental bodies constrained by rather strict mandates. Attempting to formulate <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> to govern state sponsored developmentt [sic] through theories of justice, such as those proposed by Beitz and Pogge, is also problematic. The constraints of a governments' mandate can conflict with the demands of contemporary theories of justice. An alternative approach- suggested by the ethic of Brundtlandwhich would base state sponsored development upon <b>an</b> interest based <b>ethic</b> requires examination. Many of the problems of development evince structures similar to those described by game theorists as assurance games and prisoner's dilemms. If this is the case, and <b>a</b> legitimate <b>ethic</b> can be constructed which guides agents behavior toward attaining optimal results, such <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> may be appropriate for guiding state sponsored development. It is suggested that <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> such as Gauthier proposes in Morals by Agreement may be best suited to guide development policy.
