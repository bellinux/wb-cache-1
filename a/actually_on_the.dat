5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} and final season, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State. Although {{reluctant}} with the plan at first, Aang accepts to have everyone think he had died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but are thwarted by Azula. However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father, and offers to teach Aang Firebending. Aang and Zuko also improve their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two dragons. During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang is reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives convincing him it is the only way. But upon learning that he was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a Lion Turtle, one of four that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtles' Energybending ability. With this ability, as he regained his Avatar State, Aang removes Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord. The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea shop at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, {{the story}} of the flight was {{featured}} in the Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic television show Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency). In the show, the flight is dramatized on the basis of ATC tapes as well as the CVR recordings. In interviews conducted for the 2005 program, the relief first officer's family members vehemently dispute the suicide/deliberate crash theories and dismiss them as biased. The program nevertheless concludes that he crashed the plane for personal reasons: he had been severely reprimanded by his supervisor for sexual harassment, and the supervisor was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plane.|$|E

25|$|The parish saw {{a little-known}} skirmish. On 14 June 1497 the first Cornish Rebellion was {{launched}} against Henry VII, the rebels were marching from Cornwall, to Kent unbeknown to the King, and having already passed Guildford, had a skirmish {{with some of}} the outposted royal troops on the road from Guildford to London. The troops fell back or were outmanoeuvred, for they had lost the rebels on the 16th and were looking for them on the Portsmouth Road again near Kingston when they were <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border of Kent. Old maps mark the place where the road crosses the stream which joins the Wey near Send as St. Thomas's Waterings.|$|E
25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E

25|$|Wilder {{moved with}} her family from Wisconsin in the year 1869, when she was two years old. They stopped in Rothville, Missouri, and settled in Kansas, in Indian country near what is now Independence. Her younger sister Carrie (1870–1946) was born there in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Wilder in later years, {{her father had been}} told that the {{location}} would soon be open to white settlers but that was incorrect; their homestead was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Osage Indian reservation and they had no legal right to occupy it. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that the settlers would be evicted, and they departed in spring of 1871. Although Laura portrayed the leave and that of other settlers as prompted by rumors of eviction in both her novel and in her Pioneer Girl memoirs, in the memoirs she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the entire mortgage. Several Kansas neighbors apparently were allowed to buy the land they had settled on so the rumors may have been untrue.|$|E

[...] An India Today reviewer enjoyed the premiere episode, saying it had [...] "drama, glitz and glamour", and concluded that [...] "some of the participants on the show displayed fantastic singing."

Appreciating the show, she said that the focus of the show was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> talent.|$|E
500|$|New {{character}} Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{prepares for}} a book club meeting in a modern suburban home. The club is in a heated discussion of Stephen King's Carrie, when they are interrupted by what sounds like an earthquake. The group leaves Juliet's house and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), previously known as [...] "Henry Gale" [...] to the survivors, appears along with Ethan Rom (William Mapother), looking up to watch Oceanic Flight 815 break apart in mid-air. Ben quickly orders Goodwin (Brett Cullen) and Ethan to join the survivors, stay undercover, and provide [...] "lists in three days."

500|$|Secretariat wintered in Florida {{but did not}} race until March 17, 1973 in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, {{where he}} went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer {{of one of his}} opponents put it, [...] "The only chance we have is if he falls down." [...] Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had {{committed}} a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> receiving end of a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.|$|E
500|$|He {{restored}} the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, {{his home in}} Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including [...] "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the [...] garden. Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Less than 15 {{hours before}} the {{scheduled}} July 2 execution, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty—that, ultimately, were never resolved. A new date (November 18, 1986) was then set {{to carry out the}} Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17. In mid-1988 the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling. Within hours of that final denial a firm execution date of January 24, 1989 was announced. Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy {{as fast as they could}} ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fast track." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} of Manning's works is the British empire in decline. Her fiction {{contrasts}} deterministic, imperialistic views of history with one that accepts {{the possibility of}} change for those displaced by colonialism. Manning's works take a strong stance against British imperialism, and are harshly critical of racism, anti-Semitism and oppression {{at the end of}} the British colonial era. [...] "British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self-serving system, which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of being dismantled", writes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning's novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence. In this view, Harriet's character, marginalised as an exile and a woman, is both oppressor and oppressed, while characters such as Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others, reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, who has written extensively on Manning's writing from a colonial and post-colonial perspective, notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers; the responses of the Pringles assert [...] "the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised" [...] and native Egyptians, though given very little direct voice in The Levant Trilogy, nevertheless assert subjectivity for their country.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} the crew {{were out on the}} {{surrounding}} ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, and all of the Inuit, found themselves stranded on an ice floe. The castaways could see the Polaris [...] away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile. Resigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had [...] of food. They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice. Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the Davis Strait and would soon be within rowing distance of Disko. He was incorrect; the men were <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land very unlikely. One night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores. The group drifted on the ice floe {{for the next six months}} over [...] before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by the sealer Tigress on April 30, 1873. All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ebierbing and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions. Despite this, scarcely a word was written about the Inuit in either the official reports of the expedition, or the press.|$|E
500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was <b>actually</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not much you can do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. Then somebody said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E
