40|$|The {{clinical}} use of various aerosol production apparatus for chronic sinusitis was examined. The results are summarized as follows. 1) In <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> therapy for chrohic sinusitis {{the most essential}} {{point is that the}} natural ostia are sufficiently open. 2) Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses are part of a single organ. Therefore the jet nebulizer and the ultrasonic nebulizer for nasal cavity were also useful for paranasal sinuses when the middle meatus lesions were reversible. 3) The most important factor in promoting aerosol deposition in paranasal sinuses was the application of pressure. Without pressure, none of the nebulizers was able to administer sufficient amounts of therapeutic agents. 4) The ultrasonic nebulizer with pressure added was able to administer the largest amount of agent to the paranasal sinuses. As chronic sinusitis is becoming less severe, <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> therapy is becoming more widely used. Even if the middle meatus lesions are irreversible, <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> therapy can heal chronic sinusitis when an endonasal operation is employed as well.

40|$|Abstract I The {{respiratory}} tract is the portal of entry and target organ of many aerosolized toxins and infective agents, {{and there is}} increasing need for testing the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents delivered directly into the lungs. Intratracheal instillation and <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> are the two methods most often used to introduce drugs, toxins, or infective agents into the {{respiratory tract}} of experimental animals. In this study we compared the distribution and efficacy of antibodies given to mice by <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> or intratracheal instil-lation. We determined the pulmonary distribution of these antibodies by immunohistochemistry and observed the distribution and severity of pulmonary lesions that developed after exposure to aerosolized ricin. Although antibodies administered by either method prevented death, we found that instilled antibodies tended to con-centrate around terminal airways and often failed to reach peripheral lung fields. Sometimes entire lung lobes were missed by the instillation route. Acute and chronic pulmonary lesions developed in the unprotected areas of instillation-treated lungs. In contrast, aerosolized antibodies covered all pulmonary surfaces and effectively prevented ricin-induced lesions throughout the lungs. Our {{findings suggest that the}} <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> method may be preferable for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents in the respiratory tract because of the failure of instilled agents to reach and protect peripheral alveoli.

Repeated planar gamma scintigraphy was found to provide the same information on total pulmonary drug deposition as an independent method that involved assessments of urinary drug recovery after blockage of gastrointestinal drug absorption when all of the critical parts of the methodological procedures were accurately and meticulously executed. In this work, the inhalation flow used at dry powder <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> did not appear to influence intrapulmonary deposition pattern or total pulmonary deposition.

To further {{investigate the}} relationship between tachykinin-mediated airway constriction and oxygen radicals, we explored citric acid-induced bronchial constriction in 48 young Hartley strain guinea-pigs, divided into six groups: control; citric acid; hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes+citric acid; hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes+phosphoramidon+citric acid; dimethylthiourea (DMTU) +citric acid; and DMTU+phosphoramidon+citric acid. Hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes and DMTU are scavengers of oxygen radicals while phosphoramidon is an inhibitor of the major degradation enzyme for tachykinins. Animals were anaesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated. Each animal was given 50 breaths of 4 [*]ml saline or citric acid aerosol. We measured dynamic respiratory compliance (Crs), forced expiratory volume in 0. 1 (FEV 0. 1), and maximal expiratory flow at 30 % total lung capacity (V[dot above]max 30) to evaluate the degree of airway constriction. Citric acid, but not saline, <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> caused marked decreases in Crs, FEV 0. 1 and V[dot above]max 30, indicating marked airway constriction. This constriction was significantly attenuated by either hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes or by DMTU. In addition, phosphoramidon significantly reversed the attenuating action of hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes, but not that of DMTU. Citric acid <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> caused increases in both lucigenin- and t-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence counts, indicating citric acid-induced increase in oxygen radicals and decrease in antioxidants in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These alterations were significantly suppressed by either hexa(sulphobutyl) fullerenes or DMTU.

Here isotretinoin was formulated as a powder aerosol, and its delivery to the lungs of rats was studied with the aim to explore the possibility of minimizing adverse effects associated with its {{oral administration}}. Rats received isotretinoin orally (0. 5, 1 or 10 mg kg– 1) or by inhalation (theoretical dose ~ 1 or ~ 10 mg kg– 1) in a nose-only inhalation chamber. Isotretinoin was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography in plasma and lung tissue. The ratios of mean area of concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) values in the lungs over mean AUCs in the plasma for isotretinoin following single or repeated aerosol exposure surpassed those determined for the oral route by factors of between two (single low-dose) and five (single high-dose). Similarly, the equivalent ratios for the maximal peak concentrations in lungs and plasma obtained after aerosol exposure consistently exceeded those seen after oral administration, suggesting that lungs were exposed to higher isotretinoin concentrations after <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> than after oral administration of similar doses. Repeated high doses of isotretinoin by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage.

We have utilized the lung slice model to determine if cellular targets are similar following in vitro exposure to JP- 8. Agar-filled adult rat lung explants were cored and precision cut, using the Brendel/Vitron tissue slicer. Slices were cultured on titanium screens located as half-cylinders in cylindrical Teflon cradles that were loaded into standard scintillation vials and incubated at 37 –C. Slices were exposed to JP- 8 jet fuel (0. 5 mg/ml, 1. 0 mg/ml, and 1. 5 mg/ml in medium) for up to 24 hours. We determined ATP content using a luciferin-luciferase bioluminescent assay. No significant difference was found between the JP- 8 jet fuel doses or time points, when compared to controls. Results were correlated with structural alterations following <b>aerosol</b> <b>inhalation</b> of JP- 8. As a general observation, ultrastructural evaluation of alveolar type II cells revealed an apparent increase in the number and size of surfactant secreting lamellar bodies that was JP- 8 jet fuel-dose dependent.

Using this model we studied the effects of aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH) 3), known to enhance IgE antibody responses, compared with cholera toxin (CT), a potent mucosal adjuvant, on the immune response to birch pollen (BP) and its major allergen Bet v 1. Two groups of BALB/c mice were either systemically immunized with recombinant Bet v 1 in Al(OH) 3 and subsequently aerosol exposed to BP allergen, or aerosolized with BP and CT. IgE-mediated skin reactions were only elicited in the mice which had received Bet v 1 /Al(OH) 3. Allergen-specific serum IgE and IgG 1 antibodies dominated in the Al(OH) 3 group, IgG 2 a antibody levels to BP and rBet v 1 were markedly higher in the sera of mice exposed to CT with the allergen. IgA antibodies were only detected in the bronchial lavage of the CT-treated group. Moreover, the latter group displayed consistently higher T cell proliferative responses to BP and interferon-gamma production in vitro. Thus, the systemic immunization with rBet v 1 in Al(OH) 3 before inhalation of the BP extract promoted a Th 2 -like immune response, while CT mixed with the aerosolized BP extract rather induced a Th 1 -like immune response. In an attempt to reverse these ongoing immune responses we could achieve a shift towards a Th 0 response. Immunization with BP extract without adjuvant treatment led to undetectable antibody or cellular immune responses.
