Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed.

Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire {{in the case of}} cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the USA in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration.|$|E

40|$|Section I: Novel bicyclic {{thiazolidine}} lactams were synthesized from Fmoc <b>acetal</b> Merrifield <b>resins</b> {{to demonstrate}} a new synthetic procedure permitting {{the use of a}} wide range of functionality and an expanded scope of traditional solid-phase organic and peptide chemistry. The Fmoc <b>acetal</b> <b>resins,</b> which play a pivotal role as versatile intermediates, were prepared, N-deprotected, and subsequently acylated with ozone-incompatible groups such as furanyl and alkenyl. Although the N-acylated <b>acetal</b> <b>resins</b> can be directly converted to bicyclic thiazolidine lactams by reaction with substituted cysteine dertivatives at elevated temperatures, it has been demonstrated that initial hydrolysis of the <b>acetal</b> <b>resins</b> to the aldehyde resins using 35 : 60 : 5 trifluoroacetic acid:dichloro-methane:water before treatment with amino thiols led to the subsequent use of considerably milder cyclitive cleavage conditions. In all cases cyclitive cleavage using cysteine derivatives afforded two major diastereomers which were separated by normal or reverse-phase (C 18) preparative HPLC. The stereoisomers were fully characterized spectroscopically (1 HNMR, 13 CNMR, DEPT 90 / 135, HSQC, COSY, HMBC) and relative stereochemistry was determined using 1 -D nOe difference spectroscopy and 2 -D NOESY. ^ Section II: Trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage of Rink resin-bound N-acylated amino acid amides afforded mixtures of primary amides and their carboxylic acid hydrolysis products. The majority of the hydrolysis occurred post-cleavage in solution. The rate of hydrolysis was sensitive to the electronic substituent effects of the acyl group and amide susceptibility to hydrolysis can be predicted from the substituent 2 ̆ 7 s Hammett sigma value. The rate-enhancing substituent effect of the p-methoxy group was nullified or retained by carbonyl group insulation or conjugation, respectively. The effect was also observed with acyl groups R 2 CO (R 2 = alkyl) and followed the trend whereby the rate of hydrolysis increased proceeding from primary to secondary to tertiary alkyl. Hydrolysis was completely suppressed by use of cleavage cocktails containing 65...|$|R

50|$|<b>Acetal</b> <b>resins</b> are {{sensitive}} to acid hydrolysis and oxidation by agents such as mineral acids and chlorine. POM homopolymer is also susceptible to alkaline attack and is more susceptible to degradation in hot water. Thus low levels of chlorine in potable water supplies (1-3 ppm) can be sufficient to cause environmental stress cracking, a problem experienced in both the USA and Europe in domestic and commercial water supply systems. Defective mouldings are most sensitive to cracking, but normal mouldings can succumb if the water is hot. Both POM homopolymer and copolymer are stabilized to mitigate these types of degradation.|$|R

The therapeutic use of thermoplastic materials has increased drastically in the late decade. This new procedure, during which a fully polymerized basic material is softened by heat (without chemical changes) and injected afterwards, has opened up a new chapter in making dentures. The excellent tissue-friendly and mechanical characteristics of these basic materials can only be made to last by an exactly executed and reproducible technology. The Valplast clasp blends with the surrounding tissue and virtually disappears. Valplast partials are smooth and comfortable against the tongue.

This new material is synthesized from tannin and furfuryl alcohol, {{both of which}} are inexpensive plant-derived chemicals. The co-polymerization process of these two chemicals was studied by C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectroscopy. The 100 % renewable bioresourced tannin-furanic thermosetting resin was found to have a glass transition temperature as high as 211 degrees C, and a 95 % weight loss temperature of 244 degrees C and 240 degrees C in a nitrogen and in an air atmosphere, respectively. The char yield is as high as 52 %. Moreover, this new thermoset material shows excellent mechanical properties: a Brinell hardness of 23 HBS, which is higher than commercial acrylic, polyvinyl chloride, and a little lower than that of solid polystyrene. The compressive break strength was found to be as high as 194. 4 MPa, thus higher than that of filled phenolic resins, and much higher than that of solid polystyrene and of <b>acetal</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another highly {{reactive}} gas is chlorine, which will attack susceptible polymers such as <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> and polybutylene pipework. There {{have been many}} examples of such pipes and acetal fittings failing in properties in the USA {{as a result of}} chlorine-induced cracking. Essentially the gas attacks sensitive parts of the chain molecules (especially secondary, tertiary or allylic carbon atoms), oxidising the chains and ultimately causing chain cleavage. The root cause is traces of chlorine in the water supply, added for its anti-bacterial action, attack occurring even at parts per million traces of the dissolved gas. The chlorine attacks weak parts of a product, and, {{in the case of an}} <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> junction in a water supply system, it is the thread roots that were attacked first, causing a brittle crack to grow. The discoloration on the fracture surface was caused by deposition of carbonates from the hard water supply, so the joint had been in a critical state for many months.|$|E

50|$|Dilutions {{containing}} {{more than}} 500ppm available chlorine are corrosive to some metals, alloys and many thermoplastics (such as <b>acetal</b> <b>resin)</b> {{and need to}} be thoroughly removed afterwards, so the bleach disinfection is sometimes followed by an ethanol disinfection.

50|$|In 1960, DuPont {{completed}} {{construction of}} a plant to produce {{its own version of}} <b>acetal</b> <b>resin,</b> named Delrin, at Parkersburg, West Virginia. Also in 1960, Celanese completed its own research. Shortly thereafter, in a limited partnership with the Frankfurt firm Hoechst AG, a factory was built in Kelsterbach, Hessen; from there, Celcon was produced starting in 1962, with Hostaform joining it a year later. Both remain in production under the auspices of Celanese and are sold as parts of a product group now called Hostaform/Celcon POM.|$|E

50|$|Trace {{evidence}} is sometimes {{an important factor}} in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident. For example, tire burn marks on a road surface can enable vehicle speeds to be estimated, when the brakes were applied and so on. Ladder feet often leave a trace of movement of the ladder during a slipaway, and may show how the accident occurred. When a product fails for no obvious reason, SEM and Energy-dispersive X&#8209;ray spectroscopy (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> water pipe joint suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated. Analysis of the joint showed traces of chlorine, indicating a stress corrosion cracking failure mode. The failed fuel pipe junction mentioned above showed traces of sulfur on the fracture surface from the sulfuric acid, which had initiated the crack.|$|E

One of the oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E

Fabricating an esthetically pleasing RPD while avoiding the unsightly display associated with conventional clasp assemblies often presents a challenge to dentists.

In particular, acetal resins are being more widely used in areas where metals were traditional, because of their superior chemical stability, mechanical strength, and plasticity (Schweitzer et al. 1959; Koch and Lindvig 1959). Accordingly, development of a more practical and economic process for production of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane is important due to the rapid expansion of <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> production (Masamoto et al. 2000; Grützner et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To explore haptic shape {{constancy}} across distance, {{we measured}} per-ceived curvature thresholds of cylindrical shapes, {{cut out of}} <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> blocks. On each trial, blindfolded observers used their bare finger to scan the surface {{of two of the}} shapes consecutively. One shape was close to the observer and the other positioned further away. This spatial displacement changes the available proprioceptive information about the object shape, and therefore the combined proprio-tactile information may signal different objects at the two distances. The results reveal a perceptual compensation for the change in proprioceptive information. However, two distinct patterns of distance compensation emerged: one groups ’ data are consistent with predictions from visual object constancy. The other group of observers demonstrate the reverse pattern of response such that objects further away need to have lower curvature to be perceived having equal curvature. We propose that perceived haptic curvature across distance de-pends on observers ’ differential weighting of the multiple available cues...|$|E
40|$|A method {{employing}} aqueous {{media for}} isolation of nuclei from rat skeletal muscle is described. The technique involves (a) mincing and then homogenizing in a 0. 32 M sucrose-salt solution with a Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer using a Delrin (an <b>acetal</b> <b>resin)</b> pestle and a carefully controlled, relatively large pestle-to-glass clearance, (b) filtering through fiberglass {{and stainless steel}} screens of predetermined mesh size to remove myofibrils and connective tissue, and (c) centrifuging in a 2. 15 M sucrose-salt solution containing 0. 7 m_u ATP. Electron and phase-contrast microscopic observations show that the nuclei are intact, unencumbered by cytoplasmic tags, and possess well preserved distinct nucleoli, nucleoplasm, and nuclear membranes. Cytoplasmic contamination is minimal and mainly mitochondrial. Chemical assays of the nuclear flacfion show that the DNA/protein and RNA/ DNA ratios are comparable to those obtained in other tissues. These ratios, {{as well as the}} low specific activity obtained for cytochrome c oxidase and the virtual absence of myofibrillar ATPase, indicate a high degree of purity with minimal mitochondrial and myofibrillar contamination. The steps comprising the technique and the reasons for their selection are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} surface {{properties}} of Delrin have been investigated. Delrin is a homopolymer of <b>acetal</b> <b>resin.</b> To study the degradation {{and the effect}} of the environment on the surface of this material, samples of Delrin were immersed in saline water with salinities of 0. 005 - 100 mS/cm at 0, 23, 60 and 98 °C. Specimens were also placed in air at these four temperatures. The contact angle of a 4 mu 1 sessile droplet of distilled water on the surface of Delrin as a measure of the surface wetability or the hydrophobicity has been measured in this study. Increasing the parameters of temperature, salinity (up to certain level), and the length of time of immersion decreased the contact angle until it reached saturation. The dc and ac breakdown, water absorption and surface roughness of Delrin were also measured and were found to have correlations with the hydrophobicity of Delrin. After the reduction of hydrophobicity had reached saturation, the specimens were removed from the saline solutions. The effects of volume of the droplet of distilled water and the time to measure the contact angle after placing the droplet on the surface were also studied. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|The Modular System {{draws on}} {{traditional}} wood engraving, woodcut and letterpress practices. It comprises two printing surfaces and printing furniture specifically devised to facilitate offset and transfer relief printing. Rigid <b>acetal</b> <b>resin</b> tint blocks, hand or laser engraved, generate tone or colour {{that may be}} applied {{to more than one}} image. Multiple overprinting produces variant colour mixtures. Their function is similar to late nineteenth-century tints devised for colour letterpress printing. Compound printing surfaces of linoleum or vinyl are segmented and joined to make removable and replaceable parts. They print variable configurations in a process that resembles historical solutions to simultaneous colour printing: from the Mentz Psalter (1475), to the compound plates of William Congreve (1820) and the segmented wood engravings of John Holt Ibbetson (1819). These compound surfaces also act as receptors for impressions from the tint blocks. Repositioning and offsetting them is expedited by press furniture especially devised for the project. Registration devices are based on the simple Japanese kent? system and laser-cut circular chases derived from traditional letterpress furniture. Printing the tint blocks directly onto the flexible compound surfaces produce two viable prints that are offsets of each other. They are reversed, but one offset is also tonally inversed. It is this unpredictable tonality that has driven this experimental project. Both the construction and processes developed using the Modular System directed historical research into functional colour relief printing which consequently unearthed examples that would influence the further development of the project. This has generated both devices and processes capable of wider applications. Printing surfaces employed in the Modular System may be laser engraved or cut and adapted to use in both lithography and intaglio printmaking...|$|E
