We compared nirS and nirK abundances with the <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of denitrification, the longitudinal coefficient of denitrification (i. e., Kden, which represents optimal denitrification rates at given environmental conditions), and water quality in seven prairie streams to determine if nir-gene abundances explain denitrification activity.

40|$|The <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of {{reabsorption}} by superficial rat proximal tubules {{was measured}} by the in situ microperfusion technique under conditions of hydropenia, infusion of saline, and infusion of saline plus aortic constriction sufficient to decrease whole kidney filtration rate below hydropenic levels. Fractional reabsorption was measured in adjacent filtering nephrons by collecting and recollecting tubular fluid from late proximal convolutions during each experimental condition. During hydropenia, the <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of proximal tubular reabsorption averaged 3. 56 ± 0. 60 nl/min per mm and late proximal tubular fractional reabsorption averaged 0. 56 ± 0. 10. From these two measurements and measurements of tubule length to the site of micropuncture, a value for filtration rate was calculated for filtering nephrons. During hydropenia this value averaged 32. 9 ± 7. 1 nl/min. Saline infusion increased sodium excretion to 5. 5 % of the filtered load as the <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of proximal tubular reabsorption decreased 38 % and fractional reabsorption decreased 45 %. Calculated superficial nephron filtration rate increased 21 % which on the average was identical with the simultaneously measured increase in whole kidney filtration rate. Similar results were obtained in a separate group of animals by the technique of total collection of late proximal tubular fluid. Aortic constriction during saline infusion decreased whole kidney and calculated nephron filtration rate to the same degree and to values lower than those during hydropenia. Fractional reabsorption increased but not to hydropenic values. The persistent natriuresis during aortic constriction was associated with a continued depression of the <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of proximal tubular reabsorption which was sufficient to maintain an increased delivery of filtrate out of the proximal tubule despite the fall in nephron filtration rate. These results indicate that depressed fractional reabsorption in the proximal tubule during acute saline infusion is due predominantly to a decrease in <b>absolute</b> reabsorptive <b>rate</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} to an increase in superficial nephron filtration rate which is proportional to the increase in whole kidney filtration. Continued natriuresis when filtration rate is decreased during saline infusion can be accounted for entirely by the persistent large reduction in the <b>absolute</b> <b>rate</b> of proximal tubular reabsorption...|$|R

The chlorine atoms react with benzene (k 3 = 6. 0 7 10 9 M - 1 s -) to form a species which is firmly identified as the C 6 H 6 Cl 7 3 ̆c 0 -complex, 1.

40|$|Context: Few {{epidemiological}} {{studies have examined}} the relationship between chronic respiratory symptoms and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at work in adults, and none have shown clear dose-response relationships. Objective: To examine the respiratory effects of ETS exposure at home and at work among never-smoking adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey conducted in December 1995 and January 1996 among 4468 male and 728 female police officers in Hong Kong who were never-smokers. Main Outcome Measures: Respiratory symptoms and physician consultation in the previous 14 days for such symptoms by presence and amount of ETS exposure at work. Results: Eighty percent of both men and women reported ETS exposure at work. Significant odds ratios (ORs) for respiratory symptoms were found among men with ETS exposure at work (for any respiratory symptoms, difference in <b>absolute</b> <b>rate,</b> 20. 4 %; OR, 2. 33; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 97 - 2. 75; attributable risk, 57 %) and physician consultation (difference in <b>absolute</b> <b>rate,</b> 4. 5 %; OR, 1. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 1. 61; attributable risk, 23 %). Trends were similar among women for any respiratory symptoms (difference in <b>absolute</b> <b>rate,</b> 15. 4 %; OR, 1. 63; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 2. 56; attributable risk, 39 %) and for physician consultation (difference in <b>absolute</b> <b>rates,</b> 2. 8 %; OR, 1. 45; 95 % CI, 0. 87 - 2. 41; attributable risk, 31 %). Positive dose-response relationships with number of coworkers smoking nearby and amount of ETS exposure in the work place were found. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence of the serious health hazards associated with ETS exposure at work. The findings support a ban on smoking in the workplace to protect all workers in both developed and developing countries. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
