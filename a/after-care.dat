25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study in}} adult polydrug users in a detoxification program showed {{the efficacy of}} prasterone treatment combined with psychosocial enrichment and <b>after-care.</b> Prasterone administration positively affected decision-making, mood and well-being as early as one month into treatment, and had a long-lasting preventive effect on relapse to drug use. In a 16-month follow-up, relapse rates of prasterone-treated subjects were only 11.5%. No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.|$|E
500|$|Though Brinkley {{continued}} {{to perform the}} occasional goat gland transplant, in Texas his practice shifted mostly to performing slightly modified vasectomies and prostate [...] "rejuvenations" [...] (for which he charged up to $1,000 per operation ($ in current value), and prescribed his own proprietary medicine for <b>after-care).</b> [...] His business, fueled by radio advertisements and speeches, {{continued to}} thrive, and he opened another clinic in San Juan, Texas specializing in the colon. By 1936, Brinkley had amassed enough wealth to build a mansion {{for himself and his}} wife on [...] of land. [...] Brinkley boasted a stable of a dozen Cadillacs, a greenhouse, a foaming fountain garden surrounded by 8,000 bushes, exotic animals imported from the Galapagos Islands, and a swimming pool with a [...] diving tower. [...] Brinkley continued living high in Del Rio, until in 1938 a rival doctor began cutting into Brinkley's business by offering similar procedures much more cheaply. [...] When Del Rio's city elders refused to put the competitor out of business, Brinkley closed up shop and reopened in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas with another hospital at what is now Marylake Monastery.

2500|$|After the Second World War, prison populations dropped, causing undercrowding {{and prison}} disturbances. This {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the Fauteaux Committee in 1953. The Committee saw prisons not merely as fulfilling a custodial role, but also to provide programs that would promote [...] "worthwhile and creative activity" [...] and address the basic behaviour, attitudes and patterns of inmates. This meant prisons had to change to support such programs and provide opportunities for vocational training, pre-release and <b>after-care</b> programs. The Fauteux Report recommended hiring more, and better-trained, personnel, including those with professional qualifications in social work, psychology, psychiatry, criminology and law. An important legacy of the Committee was the creation of the National Parole Board in 1959 and the development of a system of parole to replace the former ticket of leave system. While stating that parole was not to be a reduction, or undermining, of the sentence, the committee emphasized its strong support for parole: ...|$|E
