The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Malaria Surveillance System, using data supplied by state and local health departments (SLHDs), is maintained to detect local malaria transmission and monitor trends in imported cases. To determine the completeness of reporting of malaria cases to SLHDs, cases identified by local surveillance systems were compared with those identified through <b>active</b> case <b>detection</b> conducted at all laboratories that receive clinical specimens from 11 metropolitan areas in Arizona, Cali-fornia, New Mexico, and Texas. Of the 61 malaria cases identified through either local surveillance or <b>active</b> case <b>detection,</b> 43 (70 %) were identified by SLHDs (range by metropolitan area 5 50 – 100 %) and 56 (92 %) through <b>active</b> case <b>detection.</b> High percentages of cases were identified by SLHDs in New Mexico (80 %) and San Diego County (88 %), where laboratories are required to send positive blood smears to the SLHD laboratory for confirmation. Completeness of reporting, calculated using the Lincoln-Peterson Capture-Recapture technique, was 69 % for SLHD surveillance systems and 89 % for laboratory-based <b>active</b> case <b>detection.</b> The high percentage of cases identified by the 11 SLHDs suggests that the National Malaria Surveillance System provides trends that accurately reflect the epidemiology of malaria in the United States.

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{security}} {{becomes an}} important topic in re-cent years, as {{to overcome the}} botnet in a virtualized environment is a critical task for the cloud providers. Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could {{not aware of the}} existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware. Keywords—bot, fingerprinting, hypervisor, intrusion detection. I...|$|E

For wet tropical forest ecosystems we developed a metric called the fire-driven deforestation potential (FDP) that integrated information about the length and intensity of the dry season. FDP partly explained the spatial and interannual pattern of fire-driven deforestation across tropical forest regions. This climate-fire link in combination with higher precipitation rates in the interior of the Amazon suggests that a negative feedback on fire-driven deforestation may exist as the deforestation front moves inward.

40|$|Background: Dual Chamber Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) in {{addition}} to providing hemodynamically improved bradycardia support can also reduce the incidence of inappropriate ventricular shocks owing to episodes of Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), with reported incidence of up to 41 % of patients. An atrio-ventricular (AV) discrimination algorithm is needed in dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) to avoid these inappropriate shocks. Methods: An AV discrimination algorithm, SMART DetectionTM, has been developed to differentiate between episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and SVT. It relies on the concept that the chamber with the higher rate is the origin of the tachycardia. The ventricular rate stability criterion is also used to detect concurrent VT during an episode of SVT. Other parameters used in the discrimination algorithm are: atrial and ventricular rhythm multiplicity, P-R regularity, sudden onset. The SMART DetectionTM algorithm has been implemented in the Biotronik Phylax® AV dual chamber ICD. The original SMART DetectionTM has been improved recently with the addition of <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> in the case of 1 : 1 AV conduction. Results: 10 patients were implanted with Phylax® AV's at the Bakoulev Institute. Analyses of stored dual chamber intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) indicate that all episodes of VTs and Ventricular Fibrillations (VF) were terminated following appropriate therapies. No episode of Atrial Flutter (Afl) or Atrial Fibrillation (AF) was treated even though the majority of patients have a history of SVTs. In one patient, an episode of Sinus Tachycardia (ST) was inappropriately treated. Increasing the sudden onset criterion, which is used only in the case of stable 1 : 1 rhythms, was sufficient to prevent recurrence of inappropriate therapy. To avoid the necessity of setting the, not very reliable, sudden onset criterion an <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> procedure was developed. Isolated Premature Ventricular Stimuli were used to test the hypothesis of VT with retrograde atrial conduction in the 1 : 1 AV rate case. Results of acute tests of this <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> improvement are reported in this paper. Conclusion: The SMART DetectionTM algorithm, with is <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> improvement in the case of 1 : 1 AV rate, should prove to be an effective AV discrimination algorithm in dual chamber ICD which will offer freedom from unnecessary shocks in response to SVTs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the development of}} information flow analyses to support resilient design and <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> of adversaries in cyber physical systems (CPS). The area of CPS security, though well studied, suffers from fragmentation. In this paper, we consider control systems as an abstraction of CPS. Here, we extend the notion of information flow analysis, a well established set of methods developed in software security, to obtain a unified framework that captures and extends system theoretic results in control system security. In particular, we propose the Kullback Liebler (KL) divergence as a causal measure of information flow, which quantifies the effect of adversarial inputs on sensor outputs. We show that the proposed measure characterizes the resilience of control systems to specific attack strategies by relating the KL divergence to optimal detection techniques. We then relate information flows to stealthy attack scenarios where an adversary can bypass detection. Finally, this article examines <b>active</b> <b>detection</b> mechanisms where a defender intelligently manipulates control inputs or the system itself in order to elicit information flows from an attacker's malicious behavior. In all previous cases, we demonstrate an ability to investigate and extend existing results by utilizing the proposed information flow analyses...|$|E
