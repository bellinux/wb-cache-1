25|$|Before {{the advent}} of digital online public access catalogs and the Internet, {{creating}} and maintaining a library's <b>authority</b> <b>files</b> were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the <b>authority</b> <b>files</b> of the different libraries. For {{the early part of}} library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.|$|R
40|$|<b>Authority</b> <b>files</b> {{serve to}} uniquely {{identify}} real world ‘things’ or entities like documents, persons, organisations, and their properties, like relations and features. Already {{important in the}} classical library world, <b>authority</b> <b>files</b> are indispensable for adequate information retrieval and analysis in the computer age. This is because, even more than humans, computers are poor at handling ambiguity. Through <b>authority</b> <b>files,</b> people tell computers which terms, names or numbers refer {{to the same thing}} or have the same meaning by giving equivalent notions the same identifier. Thus, <b>authority</b> <b>files</b> signpost the internet where these identifiers are interlinked on the basis of relevance. When executing a query, computers are able to navigate from identifier to identifier by following these links and collect the queried information on these so-called ‘crosswalks’. In this context, identifiers also go under the name controlled access points. Identifiers become even more crucial now massive data collections like library catalogues or research datasets are releasing their till-now contained data directly to the internet. This development is coined Open Linked Data. The concatenating name for the internet is Web of Data instead of the classical Web of Documents...|$|R

40|$|To give a {{presentation}} {{on the work}} of the InterParty project the working title that first occurred to me was "From library <b>authority</b> <b>files</b> to e-commerce".

On reflection I think it is a more accurate reflection of the key drivers of the project to reverse the caption to read "From e-commerce to library authority files". For in fact this is a project initiated by people working in the trade sector who have identified a "problem" and seen part of the solution as pre-existing in library <b>authority</b> <b>files.</b> I hope to show in this presentation that, although InterParty is not a library-led project, it does offer to open up potential new partnerships that would greatly benefit authority control work in libraries...|$|R

50|$|The Name <b>Authority</b> <b>File</b> (Personennamendatei or PND) is an <b>authority</b> <b>file</b> of people, {{which served}} {{primarily}} to access literature in libraries.

50|$|The Corporate Bodies <b>Authority</b> <b>File</b> (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei) or GKD is a German {{authority}} {{control for the}} organisation of corporation names (corporate bodies) from catalogues. It is used mainly for documentation in libraries. Like the Subject Headings <b>Authority</b> <b>File</b> (Schlagwortnormdatei or SWD) and the Name <b>Authority</b> <b>File</b> (Personennamendatei or PND), the GKD is looked after and updated by the German National Library (DNB), the Bavarian State Library, the Berlin State Library and, since 1997, the Austrian National Library, several library networks taking part. The responsible editor is the State Library in Berlin. The Common Corporate File {{was created in the}} 1970s from the catalogue data of the Journal Database (ZDB).

Concepts such as language cross-linking, or interoperability in subject headings languages, which are common in today’s research in multilingual access were limited ten years ago to language specialists. MACS uses the stable authority control environment and this linking process to extend the use of subject heading languages on an international networked multilingual level...|$|R
