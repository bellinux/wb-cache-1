40|$|Vascular <b>acrosyndromes</b> {{constitute}} a common reason for physician visits. From March 2006 to March 2008 we treated Carbomed CDT evolution device 40 patients (20 with Acrocyanosis and 20 with Raynaud phenomenon), with 1 session for {{week for a}} total of 5 weeks with a maintenance every 4 weeks. Treated patients showed benefit from the first session in the 80 % of cases (court fine), In 10 % of patients said they were partially satisfied with the treatment (court fine), in the remaining 10 % sufficiently met (adequate trial). None reported a worsening of symptoms or the occurrence of adverse phenomena. In conclusion we can say that carbossiterapia is useful in the treatment of symptomatic vascular acrosindromi...|$|E

In our microcirculatory laboratory, we use intravital capillaroscopy (IC), plethysmography (P), and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) for examining <b>acrosyndromes.</b> We combine LDF with venoarteriolar reflex test, cold test, and rewarming test to achieve more reliable diagnoses of <b>acrosyndromes.</b> Patients and methods: We examined LDF and IC according to a strict protocol using a battery of tests (venoarteriolar reflex test, cold test, rewarming test) applied to five different groups of people and compared their results: healthy controls, primary Raynaud’s phenomenon (PRP), systemic scleroderma, vibration white finger, and peripheral artery occlusive disease. Our tests included 340 individuals (72 patients plus 268 controls). Results: Although all tests provided some differences between controls and patients, only the rewarming test offered significant results for differential diagnoses. Conclusion: IC and LDF combined with the battery of tests (venoarteriolar reflex test, cold test, rewarming test) under standard conditions {{can be used as}} reliable tools to distinguish between PRP and some types of secondary RP (especially in the case of systemic scleroderma, vibration white fingers, or peripheral artery occlusive disease; RPs with organic occlusions of the small arteries causing the diseases). Our methodology can help to distinguish between other types of RP, as well.
