30|$|The {{results showed}} that initial {{rotational}} angular velocity affected the water-entry process. The effects of the two torques {{were the same as}} those mentioned above. When ω ≥ − 10 °/s, the increase of initial rotational angular velocity <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> decrease of water-entry depth, horizontal displacement, and slope angle. It also <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> increase of positive rotational angular velocity and angle of attack. The vehicle rotated upwards and even overturned. When ω ≤ − 30 °/s, the decrease of initial rotational angular velocity <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> decrease of water-entry depth, horizontal displacement, rotational angular velocity, and angle of attack. It also <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> increase of slope angle. The vehicle rotated downwards and even overturned. Choosing the proper water-entry initial rotational angular velocity is crucial to prevent the overturn phenomenon.|$|R

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> healing of the leak.

5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} Black Hawk's return, {{settlers}} throughout northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin hastily constructed forts. Construction on a fort began at Ebeneezer Brigham's Moundville settlement (now Blue Mounds, Wisconsin) on May 10. As {{construction of the}} fort commenced Black Hawk found no allies so he attempted to return to Iowa, but events overtook him {{and led to the}} Battle of Stillman's Run.

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam {{and increases the}} pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E

For the album, the band aimed {{for a more}} expansive sound than the intentionally short and speedy approach implemented on <b>Accelerate.</b> <b>The</b> album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, becoming the group's tenth album {{to reach the top}} ten of the chart. This release fulfilled R.E.M.'s contractual obligations to Warner Bros., and the band began recording material without a contract a few months later with the possible intention of self-releasing the work.|$|E

5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that the termination of the Comanche program, stating {{at the time that}} they had determined that the RAH-66 to already require numerous upgrades to be viable on the battlefield and that, instead, the Army was to direct the bulk of its rotary funding towards renovating its existing attack, utility, and reconnaissance helicopters, as well as to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the Comanche with less risk. Since the cancellation, both of the prototypes have been placed on public display.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, {{the fifth}} and final known {{tropical}} cyclone of the season developed in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave. It initially moved northwestward, but turned toward the east shortly thereafter. Drifting due eastward, the storm grew into a minimal hurricane on October 31 while passing over the Cayman Islands. The hurricane's center passed {{just north of the}} island of Jamaica later that day as it weakened back into a tropical storm. Eventually, the storm turned abruptly northeastward and crossed the eastern tip of Cuba. By November 3, it had emerged into the Atlantic and entered the southern Bahamas. Beginning to <b>accelerate,</b> <b>the</b> tropical storm passed to the west of Bermuda before becoming extratropical on November 6.|$|E

5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006–10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E
5|$|The {{galvanization}} of Mogadishu's {{real estate}} sector {{was in part}} facilitated by {{the establishment of a}} local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent.

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
