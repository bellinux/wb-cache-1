5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E

Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.|$|E

25|$|The game nearly {{went against}} <b>the</b> <b>Sooners.</b> Oklahoma went three-and-out on their opening possession.

It was a defensive struggle {{for the rest of}} the first half with neither team scoring. Iowa State had a couple chances to extend their lead, but the OU defense stood strong.

Biti also said on this occasion that talks on a national unity government had collapsed because the MDC insisted on having Tsvangirai as President and excluding Mugabe from the arrangement, while ZANU-PF insisted on Mugabe remaining President. He also expressed disappointment with regional efforts to resolve the situation and doubted that the UN would be able to resolve it, saying that Zimbabweans were [...] "on their own – <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> we realise it, the better".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{having just}} two All Black caps, Lomu was {{included}} in the squad for the 1995 World Cup in South Africa. Lomu scored seven tries in five matches, two in the first match against Ireland in Johannesburg, a try in the quarter final against Scotland at Loftus Versfeld, and four tries in the semi-final against England at Newlands. The first try in the English match occurred after Lomu received a pass behind him, beat two defenders and then, after a stumble, ran straight over the top of Mike Catt. This reduced one New Zealand commentator, Keith Quinn, to gasps. After the game, England captain Will Carling said: [...] "He is a freak <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> he goes away the better". In 2002 the UK public voted Lomu's performance no. 19 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments and has been voted the try of the tournament.

25|$|During {{the summer}} {{preceding}} the season, Oklahoma was hyped to {{be a top}} 5 team and national title contender. They initially were the favorite to win the Big 12 South. Following the dismissal of OU's returning quarterback Rhett Bomar, many felt the defending national champion Texas Longhorns were now <b>the</b> favorite (<b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> dropped six spots in the Coaches Poll {{during the first two}} weeks of the season despite winning both of those weeks). <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> opened their season 3–2 with a controversial loss to Oregon and a loss to Texas. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> also lost their Heisman-hopeful running back Adrian Peterson during their sixth game to a broken collar bone. Many had written <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> off at this point. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> won their next seven games while Texas lost their last two <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> became <b>the</b> outright winners of the Big 12 South <b>and</b> faced <b>the</b> Big 12 North winner, Nebraska, in the Big 12 Championship Game.

Oklahoma brought in many of its backups in the fourth including backup quarterback Joey Halzle and fourth-string running back Mossis Madu. While Oklahoma did score three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, they only attempted two passes (both completions).|$|R

[...] That is because both <b>the</b> Longhorns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> would have had a 6–2 conference record, but the Longhorns would have won the tie-breaker by virtue of winning the head-to-head game against Oklahoma.
