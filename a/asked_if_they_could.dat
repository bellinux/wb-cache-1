5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, {{an order of magnitude}} better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1993, Tobin {{attacked}} two 14-year-old {{girls at}} his flat in Leigh Park, Havant, after they called {{to visit a}} neighbour, who was not at home. They called at Tobin's flat and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> wait there.|$|E

60|$|Kit {{went out}} and after a time three or four figures {{appeared}} among the trees across the lagoon. They {{came down to the}} mud, but when Kit shouted, <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> launch a canoe, one shrugged and they turned back.|$|R
25|$|The {{night of}} his adoption, Marcus had a dream. He dreamed that he had {{shoulders}} of ivory, and when <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> bear a burden, he found them much stronger than before. He was appalled to learn that Hadrian had adopted him. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.|$|E
25|$|A couple {{stopped at}} Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{have a look}} at the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His {{demeanor}} was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35p.m. Bryant's car was seen reversed up to the front door. It is assumed he unloaded ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Trying {{it out for}} {{the first}} time on 21 February 1940, it {{immediately}} began producing 400W of 10cm (3GHz) microwaves. Within days they noticed that it was causing fluorescent tubes to light up across the room. Quick calculations showed this meant the tube was creating about 500W, already beating the klystrons. They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work on this new cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW. In April, GEC was told of their work and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> further improve the design.|$|E
5000|$|Journal {{sources are}} direct invitations, {{publishing}} [...] "Call for Papers", and unsolicited submissions.

5|$|McKellen {{has taken}} his {{activism}} internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where {{he was invited to}} do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended. In December 2008, he was named in Out annual Out 100 list.|$|R
50|$|During 1977 - 78, Peter Larter {{played for}} Stafford, {{his first game}} being for the 4th XV, he was so modest that when he turned up at the Club looking for a game, {{he did not say}} who he was. On several Friday evenings, the Club would receive a phone call from Northampton, <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> release him to play for them the next day.|$|R
25|$|Terence Lee of Hitbox Team also {{mentions}} that the Humble Bundle {{was a success}} for their game Dustforce, even after the bundle ended. When Humble Bundle first called the team and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> port the game to Linux and bundle it, the game sold about ten copies on Steam daily. The day the Humble Indie Bundle 6 came out with Dustforce in it, sales through the Humble Bundle skyrocketed to over 50,000 copies per day. While Hitbox Team only received $178,000 out of the $2 million Humble Bundle made, the increased number of players caused daily sales of the game to jump from less than a dozen to around 50–60 copies per day.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, the last {{chief of the}} Natchez arrived at the Tunica village with a hundred men, and {{an unknown number of}} women and children. They also {{concealed}} Chickasaw and Koroa in the canebrake around the village. Cahura-Joligo informed them that he could not receive them unless they gave up their arms. They replied that this was their intention, but <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> keep them awhile longer so their women did not get the impression that their unarmed men were prisoners. He consented to their request and proceeded to distribute food to his new guests. A celebratory dance was held till after midnight, when the Tunica retired to their cabins, thinking that the Natchez would do the same. The Natchez, Chicasaw and Koroa, attacked their hosts in their cabins, and killed all they managed to surprise while asleep. Cahura-Joligo killed four Natchez during the fighting, but was eventually killed along with twelve of his warriors. His war-chief Brides les Boeufs (Buffalo Tamer), with a dozen of his warriors, repulsed the attack and retook the Head Chief's cabin. He rallied his remaining warriors and, after fighting for five days and nights without interruption, regained control of the village. Twenty Tunica were killed and as many wounded in the fighting. They had killed 33 Natchez warriors and took three prisoners. Later they burned them in ritual punishment for the attack.|$|E
25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, Salomon Kahn, {{the owner}} of the renowned Fotostudios Kardas in Berlin, {{approached}} Rollei, <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> build him a large Rolleiflex for the 9 cm x 9 cm film format. Kahn explained as a pretext, that his customers liked to keep the negatives because they had doubts about the durability of prints. Moreover, roll film was much easier to archive than glass plates.|$|R

Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh. Paul <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> try and work out their differences, but Naomi declined and he told her she would not amount to anything.|$|E
500|$|The {{song that}} plays during Bart's {{training}} montage is [...] "Winner Takes It All" [...] by American rock singer Sammy Hagar. Selman decided {{to include the}} song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film Over the Top. According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length. The song that plays during the episode's end credits is [...] "Highway to Hell" [...] by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on The Simpsons at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, {{it turned out he}} had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use [...] "Highway to Hell", the band's manager [...] "signed on right away" [...] and gave the Simpsons staff a [...] "huge discount." ...|$|E

According to Sawyer’s memoir, Prankster Ken Babbs called to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> put on an Acid Test, and Sawyer said <b>they</b> <b>could</b> as long as they didn’t give out acid (LSD) to the audience.|$|R
500|$|Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were {{emergency}} boats with {{a capacity}} of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch {{in case of a}} person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the [...] "women and children first" [...] policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board {{in the vicinity of the}} launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there had}} been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a {{transfer}} to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Earhart saw her first aircraft at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the rickety [...] "flivver" [...] was enough for Earhart, who promptly <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> go back to the merry-go-round.
