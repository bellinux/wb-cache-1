5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in its habitat or habitats.|$|E
5|$|Adaptedness is {{the state}} of being adapted: the degree to which an {{organism}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and reproduce in a given set of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Koestini falls ill, and {{her death}} is reported. Driven mad by the news, Soedjono begins {{wandering}} aimlessly. Ultimately, as if guided by some unseen force, he discovers Koestini alive {{in a village}} called Mega Mendoeng, near Bogor. This discovery brings {{him back to his}} senses, and the two are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> happily together.|$|E

5|$|Prognosis worsens {{with the}} {{severity}} of injury. Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI {{have the potential to}} cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Central American {{squirrel monkey}} {{in the wild}} is unknown, but captive specimens {{have been known to}} live more than 15 years. Other squirrel monkey species are known to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E

50|$|During the 2011 Tōhoku {{earthquake}} and tsunami, Maller was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get <b>live</b> reports from nearby the disaster, through a caller named Donald. Donald {{had attempted to}} call into the weeknight broadcaster, JT The Brick. Ultimately, JT The Brick decided not to put Donald on the airwaves.

5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals would never be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was very}} close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> comfortably in later life through Hobbs' {{substantial}} wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran {{for the rest of his}} life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. Knighted in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|Train {{operators}} will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> view <b>live</b> {{video from}} any railcar when the passenger intercom unit is activated. This will ensure operators are better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> immediately provide information to first responders.|$|R

Having only been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at the YMCA, Jack quickly accepts the offer to move in with the duo.|$|R
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E
5|$|Practical nurse Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{leaves to}} fly to New Jersey to visit her aunt. Her client and detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is forced to go with her, as he fears not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without Sharona. While at San Francisco International Airport, a woman named Barbara Chabrol (Jennifer Dale) stands on her toes to kiss her husband Stefan (Carl Marotte).|$|E
5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|The Lake Upemba {{forest tree}} frog {{is native to}} {{northern}} Angola, southern Democratic Republic of Congo, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, southwestern Tanzania and northern Zambia. Its natural habitat is moist upland wooded savannah, but it seems <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on farmland. The limits of the distribution are uncertain {{because of the difficulty}} of distinguishing this species from Leptopelis bocagii.|$|R

Del's mother shows an uncanny sense of time when she knows exactly when the rain will stop.|$|R
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characters}} of the novella, Selver, Lyubov, and Davidson, have been described by reviewers as representing three different historical attitudes towards nature. Davidson represent the machismo of some early explorers, who feared nature and wanted to overcome it. Lyubov has a more positive but highly romanticized view of the forest, while only Selver and the other Athsheans are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in harmony with it.|$|E
5|$|While much wetland habitat {{has been}} {{eliminated}} due to human activity, new muskrat habitat {{has been created}} by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution {{of some of their}} predators.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in its habitat or habitats. Ecological {{factors such as}} habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
50|$|Foxtel {{subscribers}} are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> access <b>live</b> and on-demand content within packages {{they are}} subscribed to {{through the internet}} via the Foxtel app. The service was formerly known as Foxtel Go prior to a company wide rebrand in June 2017.|$|R

50|$|The farm {{started out}} as a {{business}} to raise alligators for their hides and <b>to</b> sell <b>live</b> alligators <b>to</b> parks and zoos. The farm {{was one of the first}} to use incubators to help raise the eggs into hatchlings. In its early days, visitors were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> purchase <b>live</b> baby alligators from the farm.|$|R
5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{received}} his first command, the destroyer , on 11 November 1924. Since its home port was the Philadelphia Navy Yard and ships' captains {{did not have}} to spend their nights on board, Kinkaid was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with Helen at her parents' residence in Philadelphia. In July 1925, he was assigned to the Naval Gun Factory. He was promoted to commander in June 1926. For the next two years, he served as Fleet Gunnery Officer and Aide to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Henry A. Wiley. In 1929 and 1930, Kinkaid attended the Naval War College. This was followed by duty on the Navy General Board. He was then seconded to the State Department as a Naval Advisor at the Geneva Disarmament Conference.|$|E
5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
50|$|The series began airing on the Community Channel from 22 February 2015 at a post-watershed {{time slot}} due to mature content.
