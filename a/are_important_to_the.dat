5|$|Arachnids <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest ecology, as both {{predators and}} prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, {{they are the}} major {{arboreal}} invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative. The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest, {{is believed to be}} parthenogenetic, meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E
5|$|Business school rankings <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various {{business}} schools {{because they are}} an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will {{over the course of}} their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E

5|$|I-375 and the Chrysler Freeway {{begin at}} Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher Freeway which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways that <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the highway}} is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation's economy, defense and mobility. The traffic levels, as {{measured}} in terms of average annual daily traffic, a calculation of the average number of vehicles along a section of roadway for any given day, vary between 1,132vehicles west of M-53 and 7,029vehicles in Croswell. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) also computed the number of commercial vehicles in the 2009 survey and found that the highway was used by 120–163commercial trucks each day on average.|$|E

The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have been useful in the study of genetics and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology.|$|E
5|$|Animals that <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but {{the species}} is known to eat many other animals, {{including}} fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most}} important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} reduce media {{centralisation}} in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their program production to MediaCityUK in Salford. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local TV industry – the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. The region also {{has a reputation for}} drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, Our Friends in the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax.|$|E

5|$|Every three years, the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, MoDOT calculated that as few as 38,152vehicles traveled along the highway at the northern terminus just north of the interchange with I-70, and as many as 75,647vehicles used the highway just east of the Grandview Triangle. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the entire route is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Every {{year the}} Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts {{a series of}} surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that as few as 26,000cars used the spur at the continuation point from SR7, and as many as 72,000cars between the onramp from I-5 and SR509. The entire Tacoma Spur is listed on both the WSDOT List of Highways of Statewide Significance, which marks the highway as a critical to connecting major communities in the state, and the National Highway System, a system of roads that <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 6,655vehicles traveled I-84 at the interchange with SR-86 in Henefer, and as many as 18,945vehicles used the highway at the SR-26 interchange in Riverdale. Between 27 and 57percent of the traffic recorded consisted of trucks. These counts are of the portion of the freeway in Utah and are not reflective of the entire Interstate, or of its concurrency with I-15.

5|$|I-470 {{is one of}} 13 {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highways in Ohio and {{the only}} auxiliary Interstate Highway in West Virginia. The Ohio Department of Transportation and West Virginia Division of Highways (ODOT and WVDOH) conduct surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is {{expressed in terms of}} average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2012, they calculated that 26,500vehicles traveled along the highway at the eastern terminus in West Virginia, and 37,840vehicles used I-470 across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge.

5|$|The freeway is {{maintained}} by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), {{who is responsible for}} maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in Colorado, including highways. As part of this role, CDOT periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, CDOT calculated that as few as 56,500 vehicles used I-270 daily east of its western terminus at I-25, and as many as 89,600 vehicles used I-270 daily southeast of York Street in Commerce City.

5|$|The many {{visitors}} {{who come to}} birdwatch, sail or for other outdoor recreations <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. The spit is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward. The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.|$|E
