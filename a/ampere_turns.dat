The current to be measured is passed through the two cores, possibly by a solid bus bar. There is almost no voltage drop in this bus bar. The output signal, proportional to the <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> in the control current bus bar, is derived from the alternating excitation voltage of the magnetic amplifier, there is no voltage created or induced on the bus bar. The output signal has only a magnetic connection with the bus bar so the bus may be, quite safely, at any (EHT) voltage with respect to the instrumentation.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{actually}} two engagement times {{to consider in}} an electromagnetic coupling. The first one is {{the time it takes}} for a coil to develop a magnetic field, strong enough to pull in an armature. Within this, there are two factors to consider. The first one is the amount of <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> in a coil, which will determine the strength of a magnetic field. The second one is air gap, which is the space between the armature and the coil shell or rotor. Magnetic lines of flux diminish quickly in the air. The further away the attractive piece is from the coil, the longer it will take for that piece to actually develop enough magnetic force to be attracted and pull in to overcome the air gap. For very high cycle applications, floating armatures can be used that rest lightly against the coil shell or rotor. In this case, the air gap is zero; but, more importantly the response time is very consistent since there is no air gap to overcome. Air gap is an important consideration especially with a fixed armature design because as the unit wears over many cycles of engagement the armature and the rotor will create a larger air gap which will change the engagement time of the clutch. In high cycle applications, where registration is important, even the difference of 10-15 milliseconds can make a difference, in registration of a machine. Even in a normal cycle application, this is important because a new machine that has accurate timing can eventually see a [...] "drift" [...] in its accuracy as the machine gets older.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adjusting}} field derivatives at {{a collection of}} points to create a desired field profile has been used.

40|$|Abstract: Synchronous {{reluctance}} {{machine with}} simple salient rotor {{is known to}} have poor power factor because of its poor reactance ratio. This study presents the use of an auxiliary winding attached to a balanced capacitor to improve the effective reactance ratio as well as the performance characteristics of synchronous reluctance machine. A unique feature of this configuration is that although the machine runs at synchronous speed, the effective reactance ratio of the machine can be improved by appropriate sizing of the capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding, with the constraint of the <b>ampere</b> <b>turn</b> rating of the auxiliary winding. The operational characteristics of a simple salient rotor synchronous reluctance machine equipped with this configuration were investigated and shown to have a desirable performance. How the effective reactance ratio, power factor and airgap flux distribution depend on the size of capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding is determined using a simplified mathematical model of the system. Analytical results and experimental measurements are in good agreement, and demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the configuratio...|$|R

40|$|The power {{requirements}} of automotive alternators are increasing significantly {{due to the}} introduction of new vehicle electrical loads. Moreover, the possible transition to a 42 V electrical system is introducing new concerns regarding the load dump overvoltage transient of alternators. This thesis makes several contributions to the power density, efficiency, and transient performance of future alternators. A comparison and design optimization of four alternator types is conducted to identify the least cost alternator that meets the challenging requirements of future automobiles. Alternator designs with conventional diode rectifiers and switched-mode rectifiers are investigated. It is found that optimized Lundell alternators are capable of meeting the demands of future systems, and that wound field synchronous machines may also be competitive. It is also found that incorporation of a simple switched-mode rectifier enables substantial improvements in designs optimized for their use. The behavior of the Lundell alternator under load dump transient conditions is studied. It is found that rotor eddy currents limit {{the rate at which the}} machine can be de-excited to terminate the transient overvoltage. Models for the de-excitation process are developed based on experimental measurements, and new field control circuits are proposed that provide fast field de-excitation. (cont.) The use of foil field windings in Lundell alternators to improve alternator power density is also explored. Foil field windings are shown to provide higher conductor packing factors than conventional wire wound fields (e. g. 73 % as opposed to 64 % for a typical wire wound design) and offer improved thermal transfer properties. These advantages are demonstrated to enable significant increases in field <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> and achievable alternator output power. However, realizing these advantages requires new field excitation circuits that can deliver high field currents at low voltages, without exceeding the limited current ratings of alternator brushes. Two new field excitation circuits capable of meeting the needs of foil field windings are developed and experimentally demonstrated. The first field excitation circuit is based on the use of a coreless printed circuit board transformer with a rotating secondary for contactless transfer of power to the rotor. A stationary inverter delivers high frequency ac to the transformer primary, and the power received by the transformer secondary is rectified and delivered to the field. This approach eliminates the need for brushes, and their associated wear and current limitations. (cont.) This rotating transformer topology is designed, built and tested at standstill with a foil wound bobbin. Experimental results demonstrate that a 51 % increase in <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> on the rotor can be delivered with this approach, which is more than sufficient for practical applications. The second class of field excitation circuits developed in this thesis uses a DC/DC converter on the rotating side to provide a step down in voltage and a step up in current for the foil field. Control information is communicated to the rotating converter to regulate the field. An experimental alternator implementing a foil field winding and this excitation circuit is developed and experimentally validated. Tests at idle speed demonstrate an improvement of 15 % in alternator output power, and an approximate increase of 30 % in field <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> for similar temperature limits. It is anticipated that significantly larger power improvements could be achieved if the alternator stator were redesigned to take advantage of this improved field capability. by Leandro Manalac Lorilla.

40|$|The "theta pinch" {{phenomenon}} of plasma physics {{is used to}} break an empty cola can into two pieces and shoot the two parts out of the coil with considerable speed. A large capacitor is charged with about 1800 joules of electrical energy and discharged through a three-turn coil in which the cola can fits snugly, as shown in Figure 1. The rapid discharge of the capacitor creates a current through the coil that rises to over 10, 000 <b>amperes,</b> which in <b>turn</b> creates a rapidly increasing axial magnetic field, which in turn causes an induced electric field that causes a current of over 10, 000 amperes in the can. The magnetic force on the electrons in the can in the magnetic field of the coil break the can and shoot the two parts out of the coil. An animated graphics sequence summarizes the mechanism by which the phenomenon occurs.

The leakage flux from the conventional structure is improved with modified magnetic circuit to improve the energy and thereby the torque value. This is approached with a double stator structure design. The proposed structure is investigated with two design variations, namely, the double stator with thin pole shoe and the double stator with thick pole shoe motors. Variations in the mechanical parameters of the all the developed models are analyzed through the finite element analysis tool. In all investigations the magnetic source is fixed in both the permanent magnet volume and coil magnetomotive force, respectively, as 400 [*]mm 3 per each pole and 480 <b>Ampere</b> <b>turns</b> per pole.

40|$|ASTROMAG is a {{particle}} astrophysics facility that was originally configured for the Space Station. The {{heart of the}} ASTROMAG facility is a large superconducting magnet which is cooled using superfluid helium. The task of resizing the facility {{so that it will}} fly in a satellite in. a high angle of inclination orbit is driven by the launch weight capability of the launch rocket and the desire {{to be able to do}} nearly the same physics as the Space Station version of ASTROMAG. In order to reduce the launch weight, the magnet and its cryogenic system had to be downsized, yet the integrated field generated by the magnet in the particle detectors has to match the Space Station version of the magnet. The use of aluminum matrix superconductor and oriented composite materials in the magnet insulation permits one to achieve this goal. The net magnetic dipole moment from the ASTROMAG magnet must be small to minimize the torque due to interaction with the earth's magnetic field. The ASTROMAG magnet consists of identical two coils 1. 67 meters apart. The two coils are connected in series in persistent mode. Each coil is designed to carry 2. 34 million <b>ampere</b> <b>turns.</b> Both coils are mounted on the same magnetic axis and they operate at opposite polarity. This reduces the dipole moment by a factor of more than 1000. This is tolerable for the Space Station version of the magnet.

40|$|A five pole, one slot per phase, full pitch, twelve coil, wye connected, {{three phase}} linear {{induction}} pump {{has been designed}} for operation with 400 C sodium. The design incorporated a graded winding {{in order to reduce}} the net pulsating component of the magnetic flux density wave and a pump duct using copper side bars. The small laboratory-size pump was designed in two steps: stator design and winding design. First, the stator and core dimensions were established on the basis of maximum pressure development and maximum power at the design flow and slip. Maximum pressure output was a requirement of the intended pump application. The condition of maximum power output was used in order to provide a good pump efficiency. Second, the parameters for the induction pump equivalent circuit were determined for several winding methods. The winding method which offered 3920 <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> per phase (equivalent to a flow rate of 4. 88 gpm, a pressure of 60 psi, a line voltage of 250 volts, and a wave length of 21. 2 cm as calculated in the first step) was selected. The theoretical performance characteristics of the flat induction pump were computed using the equivalent circuit parameters for a winding with 60 turns per coil. The measurement of developed pressure (0 to 42. 13 psi), sodium flow rate (0 to 9. 93 gpm), and power input (0 to 103. 9 watts) after installation of the pump in an operational sodium circulating loop provided an experimental determination of the pump performance characteristic.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three reluctance {{machines with}} flux assistance. These machines provide alternative novel geometries that provide high efficiencies with {{a reduction in}} the <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> in the armature windings for torque production, lowering armature winding switching losses and reducing the power electronic rating. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a switched reluctance variant of the homopolar inductor alternator topology. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a simplification of the Dual Stack machine. Both machines use a toroidal field winding to provide additional flux. The methods of connecting armature coils on each stator pole to utilise the armature flux and the choice of power electronic circuitry are important. Testing shows that such machines favour unipolar excitation with single coil per pole for the armature windings. Use of the field winding in series with the armature windings improves torque production. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine can have the mechanical angular displacement between the two stator stacks varied to provide an improved back emf waveshape for smoother torque production. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine has parasitic and axial air gaps that pose interesting design issues (e. g. end thrust). Magnets can be placed in steel sections where flux is unidirectional. An ideal candidate for magnet insertion is the Flux Switching Motor. A Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor has been built that replaces the field windings with ferrite magnets. The Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor achieves efficiencies of over 80 %. It adds no additional cost to the fan application as cost savings in lower temperature rated thermoplastics offsets the cost of magnets. A prototyping circuit incorporating a novel micro-processor program to alter the commutation timings as the machine operates has been designed to allow fast optimisation of each machine for minimum input power. ...|$|E
