5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours <b>are</b> <b>green</b> and white, {{which have}} been used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks <b>are</b> <b>green,</b> usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Spartans are the {{athletic}} teams that represent Michigan State University. The school's athletic program includes 25 varsity sports teams. Their mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty, {{and the school}} colors <b>are</b> <b>green</b> and white. The university participates in the NCAA's Division I and the Football Bowl Subdivision for football. The Spartans participate {{as members of the}} Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports. Michigan State offers 12 varsity sports for men and 13 for women.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas <b>are</b> <b>green</b> rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E

The ribbon for the medal with Honour <b>is</b> <b>green</b> with a 3 mm central stripe of crimson, while the medal with Distinction <b>is</b> <b>green</b> with 6 mm stripes of crimson at the edges, and the medal with Merit <b>is</b> <b>green</b> with 3-millimetre crimson edges and a 3-millimetre crimson central stripe.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a {{study was}} done showing that 4.5% of {{products}} tested {{were found to}} <b>be</b> truly <b>green</b> as opposed to 2% in 2009. In 2009 2,739 products claimed to <b>be</b> <b>green</b> while in 2010 the number rose to 4,744. The same study in 2010 found that 95% percent of the consumer products claiming to <b>be</b> <b>green</b> <b>were</b> not <b>green</b> at all.|$|R
5|$|The nearest tube {{stations}} <b>are</b> <b>Green</b> Park in Piccadilly, and Bond Street {{station in}} Oxford Street. Despite its name, Bond Street station {{does not directly}} connect to either New or Old Bond Street. No buses use the street, although the C2 service crosses New Bond Street. Part of New Bond Street is numbered B406 but the remainder and all of Old Bond Street is unclassified. New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road {{being used as a}} rat run.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium. Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions <b>are</b> <b>green</b> in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that its beak was about 30% {{longer than that}} of the sympatric echo parakeet, and that it had a comparatively broad beak. Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its congeners in other osteological details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which <b>are</b> <b>green</b> or partially green.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors <b>are</b> <b>green</b> (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants <b>are</b> <b>green</b> because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries <b>are</b> <b>green</b> when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E
50|$|A largish {{species at}} 39 cm, its back and head <b>are</b> dark <b>green,</b> and the uppertail <b>is</b> <b>green</b> edged with white. The throat and belly <b>are</b> lighter <b>green.</b> There <b>is</b> a large blue patch around {{the eye and}} the bill <b>is</b> <b>green.</b> Sexes <b>are</b> similar, but juveniles are duller and barred above. This is {{commonly}} seen in Plathottam, India. So Plathottam is famous for malkohas.|$|R

5|$|Mac {{leaves the}} party early, but {{the leader of}} the group appears at her room. When he tries to kiss her, she pulls away. Logan (Jason Dohring) and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing. When Mac, Parker, and Veronica go to the leader’s house, they find a woman, but he invites them in anyway. Veronica finds cages of rats in Bronson’s house, but he says that they showed up on his {{doorstep}} one day. Logan has sex with a surfer woman, and when the police show up at Bronson’s house to inquire after the stolen rats, they were gone. While investigating the hard drive of the lab’s computer, Mac finds leaves, which Veronica discovers <b>are</b> <b>green</b> tea. She shows them to the coworker, Emi, and discovers that Emi stole one of the monkey’s toys.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which <b>are</b> <b>green</b> and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} colour riot, the {{dominant}} tone of which <b>was</b> <b>green.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>green,</b> green, green--the blue-green of the springing year, and sere and yellow green and tawny-brown green of autumn. There <b>were</b> orange <b>green,</b> gold green, and a copper green. And all these <b>greens</b> <b>were</b> rich <b>green</b> beyond description; {{and yet the}} richness and the greenness passed even as we gazed upon it, going out of the gray clouds and into the sea, which assumed the exquisite golden pink of polished copper, while the hollows of the smooth and silken ripples were touched by a most ethereal pea green.|$|R
50|$|Male: The {{forewings}} are ground colour black. There <b>are</b> two <b>green</b> areas. The {{underside of}} the forewing <b>is</b> <b>green.</b> The margin of the wing is black. The veins are black. There is a chain of little postdiscal internervular black spots on the wing. The hindwing inner part and the edge are black. The {{other part of the}} wing <b>is</b> <b>green</b> and contains some large, golden spots and two or more black spots. The {{underside of the}} hindwing <b>is</b> <b>green.</b> There <b>are</b> large, golden spots and three black spots. The inner edge is very hairy.|$|R
50|$|The flag has two stripes: the {{left-hand}} stripe <b>is</b> <b>green</b> {{and the right}} is yellow. On horizontal flags the upper striper <b>is</b> <b>green</b> and the lower one yellow. The coat of arms {{is placed in the}} centre.|$|R
5|$|Viruses <b>are</b> <b>green,</b> (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs <b>are</b> <b>green,</b> bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
