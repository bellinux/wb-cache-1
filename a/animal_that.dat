5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers (heterotrophs) are {{species that}} cannot {{manufacture}} {{their own food}} and need to consume other organisms. <b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> eat primary producers (like plants) are called herbivores. <b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> eat other <b>animals</b> are called carnivores, and <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> eat both plant and other animals are called omnivores.|$|R
50|$|Trapping {{evolved from}} when early man {{realized}} that he could catch <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were difficult to hunt. In <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> came out at night or were in thick brush could not be hunted successfully. Therefore, trapping methods began to be used such as deadfalls, pits, and snares to catch <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> roamed at night or in the thick brush.|$|R
50|$|The tapetum lucidum, in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> have it, {{can produce}} eyeshine, for example {{as seen in}} cat eyes at night. Red-eye effect, a {{reflection}} of red blood vessels, appears {{in the eyes of}} humans and other <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> have no tapetum lucidum, hence no eyeshine, and rarely in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> have a tapetum lucidum. The red-eye effect is a photographic effect, not seen in nature.|$|R
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> can be examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal {{were destroyed by}} phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described an <b>animal</b> <b>that,</b> as recently as 1976, had entered their village, {{was the size of a}} cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E
50|$|The kennel {{is often}} {{in need of}} foster homes for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> do not thrive in a shelter {{environment}} and {{have not yet been}} adopted. Candidates for foster care include <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> require a special diet due to illnesses like diabetes, FIV+ cats, kittens that must be bottle fed, and old or injured <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> need special attention. Foster care be short-term or long-term, depending on the animal's particular situation.|$|R
50|$|The term aquatic can {{in theory}} {{be applied to}} <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> live in either fresh water (fresh water animals) or salt water (marine animals). However, the {{adjective}} marine is most commonly used for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> live in saltwater, i.e. in oceans, seas, etc.|$|R
30|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in feed consumption of animals. Feed consumption for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were fed with 500  g kg− 1 dietary protein was significantly lower (P <  0.05) than those <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were fed with dietary protein of 210, 300, and 350  g kg− 1 in the second protein trial. The highest feed efficiency ratio tracked the weight gain of those <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were fed with the 350  g kg− 1 dietary protein and was significantly higher than 500  g kg− 1 diet.|$|R
5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|E
5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|An <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the pudús {{include the}} horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, {{and other small}} cats. The pudú is a wary <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a {{proficient}} climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15years and 9months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, {{from a wide range}} of causes. Maternal neglect of newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.|$|E

50|$|Other <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> are not {{necessarily}} predators, such as fruit bats {{and a number of}} primates also have forward-facing eyes. These are usually <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> need fine depth discrimination/perception; for instance, binocular vision improves the ability to pick a chosen fruit or to find and grasp a particular branch.|$|R
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> cat and/or {{drink in}} {{response}} to electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (ESLH-pos) are more responsive to both schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) tests {{and a series of}} amphetamine (AMPH) injections than <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> do not exhibit these behaviors (ESLH-neg). Moreover. prior exposure to the behaviorally activating SIP experience, or to AMPH, permanently trans-formed the ESLH-neg <b>animals</b> into <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> reliably ate or drank during ESLH. Prior treatment with AMPH also increases the water consumed uring subsequent SIP tests. Thus, initial of induced ifferences insensitivity to activating experiences can determine behavioral propensities...|$|R

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> preys on them. Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E
