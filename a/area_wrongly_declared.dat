This article will draw attention to a particular problem with containerised cargoes, namely the issue of correctly stating a cargo’s characteristics. Safety includes the correct statement {{with regard to the}} weight and contents of the container to be loaded. It is suggested that 10 per cent of containers have <b>wrongly</b> <b>declared</b> weights when presented to the ship for loading. These weights are declared by the shippers. Such errors can lead to stability problems and difficulties in stowage. This, in turn, can result in lives and property being put at risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{restricted}} isometry property (RIP) {{for design}} matrices gives guarantees for optimal recovery in sparse linear models. It is of high interest in compressed sensing and statistical learning. This property {{is particularly important}} for computationally efficient recovery methods. As a consequence, {{even though it is}} in general NP-hard to check that RIP holds, there have been substantial efforts to find tractable proxies for it. These would allow the construction of RIP matrices and the polynomial-time verification of RIP given an arbitrary matrix. We consider the framework of average-case certifiers, that never <b>wrongly</b> <b>declare</b> that a matrix is RIP, while being often correct for random instances. While there are such functions which are tractable in a suboptimal parameter regime, we show that this is a computationally hard task in any better regime. Our results are based on a new, weaker assumption on the problem of detecting dense subgraphs...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common attacks against Wireless Sensor Networks is the {{wormhole}} attack. In this attack, the enemy deploys two malicious nodes in two different areas of the network and establishes a high-speed dedicated channel between these two. This will cause the normal nodes in two different <b>areas</b> <b>wrongly</b> think that they are two-hop neighbors. Therefore, this attack will greatly affect the routing algorithms. In this paper, a new distributed algorithm is provided to deal with the wormhole attack. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to discover separate routes between pairs of two-hop neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm was implemented and evaluated in terms of true and false detection rate by performing a series of experiments and the results were compared with the base algorithm. The test results showed that the proposed algorithm has desirable efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduced mammals {{are a major}} {{driver of}} {{extinction}} and ecosystem change, particularly on islands. Feral goats Capra hircus have been introduced to numerous islands worldwide and have had wholesale impacts on ecosystems. Techniques are now available, however, to eradicate goat populations from islands, providing a powerful conservation tool. Goats were removed from Pinta Island, Galápagos, Ecuador after a 30 -year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41, 000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971 – 82). In the following decade the island was twice <b>wrongly</b> <b>declared</b> free of goats. During this period, the island was visited irregularly but no monitoring programme was implemented. A revised campaign over 1999 – 2003, which included improved hunting techniques and monitoring, removed the final goats from the island. The use of Judas goats was critical in locating the remaining goats and {{as a tool to}} confirm eradication. A systematic monitoring programme is critical for confirming eradication and preventing future reintroductions. An earlier monitoring programme would probably have resulted in earlier eradication and significant financial savings. Given limited resources, island conservation programmes elsewhere should strive to increase eradication efficiency and learn from past campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to eradicate feral goat populations from islands (Daly, 1989; Veitch & Clout, 2002). These techniques, which include both ground and aerial hunting campaigns, as well as the use of Judas goats, have resulted in the successful eradication of goats from> 100 islands world-wide (K. Campbell, unpub. data). The use of Judas goats, radio-collared individuals that are released and associate with conspecifics, aid in removing goats at low densities (Taylor & Katahira, 1988; Rainbolt & Coblentz, 1999). Unfortunately, the majority of eradication efforts remain unpublished, and as a result such knowledge is often unavailable to conservation practitioners (Simberloff, 2001; Donlan et al., 2003). Here, we report the 30 -year campaign to eradicated goats from Pinta Island in the Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador, the largest insular goat population removal using ground-based methods. Over 41, 000 goats were removed from Pinta during an initial hunting campaign. In the decade following, the island was twice <b>wrongly</b> <b>declared</b> eradicated (Calvopiña, 1985; Evans, 1990), highlighting the need for regular monitoring pro-grammes. Revised hunting techniques and a monitoring programme were implemented in 1999. With this programme in place, the island is now free of goats.

A Landsat image from 07 / 16 / 2008, restaured to 10 m, was used for both, the visual classification, considered as reference map, and the supervised classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm, Maxver, available in the GIS SPRING. Slope information was obtained from SRTM data, which were segmented in classes with intervals of 4 % of declivity. To assess {{the influence of}} slope in the supervised classification the two maps were overlaid in order to obtain a third map with the confusion areas, i. e. the areas which were classified as coffee plantations by the maxver algorithm but were not coffee in the reference map. This third map, with the confusion areas, was then overlaid onto the slope map. The results showed that most of the <b>areas</b> <b>wrongly</b> classified were at slopes classes of more than 12 % of declivity, demonstrating the influence of the relief in the performance of the maxver classifier. 200...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{uncertain}} when to declare success and stop control in pest eradication operations {{that rely on}} successive reductions of the population. We used the data collected during a project to eradicate feral cats from San Nicolas Island, California to estimate both the number of cats remaining {{towards the end of}} the project, and the amount and type of surveillance effort required to declare successful eradication after the last known cat was removed. Fifty seven cats were removed between June 2009 and April 2010 and our model estimated that there was a 95 % chance that a further 1 to 4 cats remained, with 1 cat being the most likely number. After this time a further two cats were detected and removed and the model predicted this outcome with a probability of 0. 25. If managers wished to confirm eradication success at this point, we estimated that 55 km of effort searching for recent evidence of cats over the whole island without detecting any would provide 99 % certainty that no cats remained (stopping rule 1). Alternatively, the optimal amount of search effort for evidence that minimized the joint cost of searching and the cost of <b>wrongly</b> <b>declaring</b> eradication was 75 km (stopping rule 2). The equivalent amount of camera-nights (26 cameras were available) required to declare successful eradication were 416 (stopping rule 1) and 1196 camera nights (stopping rule 2). During the confirmation phase, 270 km of sign search effort and 3294 camera-nights surveillance were used from late June 2010, when the last cat was removed, through August 2010, without detecting signs of survivors. Managers can be very confident that eradication has been successful...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{progress}} {{towards the}} goal of eliminating racial health disparities requires methods for assessing the existence, magnitude, and statistical significance of health disparities. In comparing disease rates, we must account for the unreliability of rates computed for small minority populations and within sparsely populated areas. Furthermore, {{as the number of}} geographic units under study increases, we also must account for multiple testing to assure we do not misclassify disparities as present when they actually are not (false positive). To date and to our knowledge, none of the methodologies in current use simultaneously address all of these important needs. And few, if any studies have undertaken a systematic comparison of methods to identify those that are statistically robust and reliable. Results We introduced six test statistics for quantifying absolute and relative differences between cancer rates measured in distinct groups (i. e. race or ethnicity). These alternative measures were illustrated using age-adjusted prostate and lung cancer mortality rates for white and black males in 688 counties of the Southeastern US (1970 – 1994). Statistical performance, including power and proportion of false positives, was investigated in simulation studies that mimic different scenarios for the magnitude and frequency of disparities. Two test statistics, which are based on the difference and ratio of rates, consistently outperformed the other measures. Corrections for multiple testing actually increased misclassification compared with the unadjusted tests and are not recommended. One-tailed tests allowed the researcher to consider a priori hypotheses beyond the basic test that the two rates are different. Conclusion The assessment of significant racial disparities across geographic areas is an important tool in guiding cancer control practices, and public health officials must consider the problems of small population size and multiple comparison, and should conduct disparity analyses using both absolute (difference, RD statistic) and relative (ratio, RR statistic) measures. Simple test statistics to assess the significance of rate difference and rate ratio perform well, and their unadjusted p -values provide a realistic assessment of the proportion of type I errors (i. e. disparities <b>wrongly</b> <b>declared</b> significant). </p...|$|R
40|$|Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) {{products}} are regularly used for vegetation monitoring missions {{and climate change}} analysis. However, satellite observation {{is affected by the}} atmospheric condition, cloud state and shadows introducing noise in the data. MODIS state flag helps in understanding pixel quality but overestimates the noise and hence its usability requires further scrutiny. This study has analyzed MODIS MOD 09 A 1 annual data set over Sri Lanka. The study presents a simple and effective noise mapping method which integrates four state flag parameters (i. e. cloud state, cloud shadow, cirrus detected, and internal cloud algorithm flag) to estimate Cloud Possibility Index (CPI). Usability of CPI is analyzed along with NDVI for noise elimination. Then the gaps generated due to noise elimination are reconstructed and performance of the reconstruction model is assessed over simulated data with five different levels of random gaps (10 – 50 %) and four different statistical measures (i. e. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, and mean absolute percentage error). The sample-based analysis over homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels have revealed that CPI-based noise elimination has increased the detection accuracy of number of growing cycle from 45 – 60 % to 85 – 95 % in vegetated regions. The study cautions that usage of time-series NDVI data without proper cloud correction mechanism would result in wrong estimation about spatial distribution and intensity of drought, and in our study 50 % of <b>area</b> is <b>wrongly</b> reported to be under drought though there was no major drought in 2014.

40|$|Across Belize, organisations {{are working}} towards {{effective}} {{management and control}} of protected conservation areas. There is a drive to look after and enhance biodiversity and cultural heritage, whilst also managing forest and other resources in a sustainable way. To effectively plan and manage this, organisations {{need to know what}} different land cover types and resources they are working with, and therefore need accurate up-to-date mapping of each area. The Toledo Institute for Environment and Development work alongside the Government of Belize Forest Department to manage a region in the district of Toledo in Southern Belize, which contains three protected areas (PAs) of varying size and terrain. This study has identified the location and extent of palmetto palm, one of the key resources within the PAs, using remote sensing techniques. This is important as it will help with a number of different management plans such as identifying palmetto areas suitable for harvesting by local communities. A maximum likelihood classifier was used on WorldView- 2 multispectral imagery to identify the key vegetation types including the palmetto in the three areas. A number of problems were identified with this process and the results produced, through comparison with ground data. Due to the overlapping of spectral signatures between the main vegetation and land cover types, large <b>areas</b> were <b>wrongly</b> identified in the classification process. A number of improvement methods were explored, which reduced the extent of the areas that had mis-classified as palmetto. This reduced overestimation of the resource and increased the user accuracy for palmetto, however there were still areas of confusion occurring between the main vegetation types. Further research {{needs to be done to}} solve this problem. Maps were produced with the final palmetto areas identified, which had a user accuracy of over 80 %...|$|R
