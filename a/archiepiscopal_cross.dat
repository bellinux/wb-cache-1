5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> on their arms.

5|$|Robert {{was present}} in January 1164 when the king summoned a council of the barons and the bishops to Clarendon, where the king demanded that both groups swear to uphold the royal rights of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I, without any {{reservations}} or conditions. Although Becket at first attempted to resist, he eventually submitted, and then forced the other bishops to swear also. In October 1164, Becket was accused of denying justice to a royal vassal, tried at a council held at Northampton, and was found guilty {{although he did not}} accept the sentence. During the trial, Robert attempted to moderate Becket's behaviour, by persuading him from having his <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross,</b> a symbol of spiritual authority, carried in front of him when he entered the court, which would have been an insult to the king. Shortly after the trial, Robert interceded with the king to order that no injury be done to Becket, who went into voluntary exile.|$|E
5|$|After Becket's {{election}} as archbishop, Foliot was nominated to the Diocese of London, {{to which he}} was translated on 6March 1163. His nomination had been put forward by the king, who wrote to the pope stating that Foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor if he was in London, rather than in Hereford on the Welsh Marches. Becket wrote to Foliot urging him to accept the translation. His transfer was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 19 March 1163 and Foliot was enthroned at London on 28April 1163. Papal confirmation was required because the movement of bishops from one see to another was still frowned on at this time. The medieval chronicler Ralph de Diceto, who was a canon at London, states that the cathedral chapter at St Paul's Cathedral, London, the cathedral of the London diocese, approved of Foliot's selection. Becket was unable to attend Foliot's enthronement, and Foliot did not make a profession of obedience to the archbishop, arguing that he had already sworn an oath to Canterbury when he became Bishop of Hereford, and thus no further oath was required. The issue was sent to the papacy, but the pope refused to be pinned down to an answer. Foliot then attempted to make London independent of Canterbury by reviving Pope Gregory I's old plan for an archbishopric at London. Foliot proposed either to have London raised to an archdiocese along with Canterbury, or to have London replace Canterbury as the archiepiscopal seat for the southern province. Foliot did though support Becket in the latter's attempt to prevent the Archbishop of York having his <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> borne in procession before him when visiting the province of Canterbury.|$|E
5000|$|In the Anglican Communion, archbishops are styled [...] "The Most Reverend" [...] and {{addressed}} as [...] "Your Grace", while bishops are styled [...] "The Right Reverend" [...] {{and addressed}} as [...] "My Lord" [...] or [...] "Your Lordship". (In some countries, this usage is followed {{also by the}} Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and [...] "The Most Reverend" [...] and [...] "Your Excellency" [...] are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an <b>archiepiscopal</b> processional <b>cross</b> (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions. The Archbishop of Canterbury's metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.|$|R
500|$|In January 1164 {{the king}} summoned a council at Clarendon. The bishops {{were asked to}} approve the Constitutions of Clarendon, which {{proposed}} restrictions on {{the powers of the}} Church and limits to papal authority in England; Becket's refusal led to the great dispute between king and archbishop, into which Foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn. When Becket appeared before the court with his <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> borne before him, a studied insult to the king, Foliot told the archbishop that [...] "If the king were to brandish his sword, as you now brandish yours, what hope can there be of peace between you?" [...] The king refused to see Becket, and negotiations between the two camps soon revealed that Becket had ordered the bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did. Becket also threatened to appeal the case to the papacy. Both of these actions by the archbishop breached the Constitutions of Clarendon. During the subsequent {{back and forth between the}} bishops and the king, as well as the bishops and the archbishop, Foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade Becket to modify his behaviour. Foliot replied that Becket [...] "was always a fool and always will be".|$|E

[...] The arms of Tenison, placed on the sinister side of the escutcheon are blazoned as: Gules, a bend engrailed argent voided azure, between three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure.|$|E
60|$|Tibble had {{no doubt}} that his master would be willing that he should give up his time for this purpose, so he {{accepted}} the invitation. The tables were by this time nearly covered, but all stood waiting, for there flowed in from the great doorway of the hall a gorgeous train--first, a man bearing the double <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> of York, fashioned in silver, and thick with gems--then, with lofty mitre enriched with pearls and jewels, and with flowing violet lace- covered robes came the sturdy square-faced ruddy prelate, who was then the chief influence in England, and after him two glittering ranks of priests in square caps and richly embroidered copes, all in accordant colours. They were returning, as a yeoman told Tibble, from some great ecclesiastical ceremony, and dinner would be served instantly.|$|E
50|$|An <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> (archbishop's cross) is a two-barred cross used by or {{to signify}} or dignify an archbishop. It is {{typically}} made like a staff {{with the two}} barred cross up top and a very long downwards extending arm.|$|E
50|$|A {{metropolitan}} archbishop also wears a pallium {{within his}} own ecclesiastical province, once he has received it from the Pope. After receiving it, he is entitled to have an <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> (with two cross-bars instead of one) carried before him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Archbishop Chia {{consists}} of a shield upon an <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> surmounted by a green galero with 10 gold fiocchi (tassels) suspended on each side. These are standard ecclesiastical heraldic devices indicating the coat of arms is that of an archbishop.|$|E
5000|$|A two-barred {{cross is}} like a Latin cross with an extra bar added. The lengths and {{placement}} of the bars (or [...] "arms") vary, {{and most of the}} variations are interchangeably called either of cross of Lorraine, the patriarchal cross, the Orthodox cross or the <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Roman Catholic heraldry, an {{archbishop}} has an ecclesiastical {{hat with}} ten tassels {{on each side}} of his coat of arms, while a bishop has only six. The <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.|$|E
5000|$|Émile Appolis wrote, in , that Vilatte {{was titled}} [...] "Old Catholic Archbishop of Babylon" [...] (...) and his cachet was an <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross,</b> with the motto —from the east, light. Likewise, Vignot {{included}} an excerpt, of Georges Aubault de la Haulte-Chambre description of Vilatte, from La Connaissance, in which Vilatte was {{also called the}} [...] "Old Catholic Archbishop of Babylon".|$|E

5000|$|The right panel {{displays}} a musical stave of Gregorian chant, imposed upon an archbishop's cross. The stave bears the first {{notes of the}} famous Gregorian hymn to the Virgin Mary, [...] "Alma Redemptoris Mater" [...] ("Hail, thou Mother of the Redeemer"). It is a reminder both of their musical vocation and of the cathedral's special consecration to the Virgin Mary. The <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> with its double cross-bar belongs exclusively to archbishops, and may be carried before them in procession. It is the sign that the cathedral is the personal seat of the archbishop, the centre of unity in the diocese.|$|E
50|$|The {{personal}} {{coat of arms}} of Archbishop Tenison {{consist of}} {{the arms of the}} see of Canterbury impaled with the Tenison family arms. The former, placed on the dexter side of honour, are blazoned as: Azure, an <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> in pale or surmounted by a pall proper charged with four crosses patee fitchee sable. The arms of Tenison, placed on the sinister side of the escutcheon are blazoned as: Gules, a bend engrailed argent voided azure, between three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure.In standard English: a red field bearing a white (or silver) diagonal band with scalloped edges, and a narrower blue band running down its centre. This lies between three gold heraldic lion's faces, each of which is pierced by a fleur-de-lys entering through the mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{papal cross}} is an emblem {{for the office}} of the Pope in ecclesiastical heraldry. It is {{depicted}} as a staff with three horizontal bars near the top, in diminishing order of length as the top is approached. The cross is thus analogous to the two-barred <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> used in heraldry to indicate an archbishop, and seems to have been used precisely to indicate an ecclesiastical rank still higher than that of archbishop. In the past, this design of the cross was often used in ecclesiastical heraldry as a distinctive mark of his office. It was often merely an artistic device, as use of a staff or crosier {{was not part of the}} traditional papal insignia. However, at least one staff surmounted with a papal cross does exist.|$|E
50|$|The badges of {{both the}} schools founded by Thomas Tenison are based on his {{personal}} coat of arms, which consist of {{the arms of the}} see of Canterbury impaling the Tenison family arms.

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Henry II, the dispute took a new form, {{concerning}} the right of either archbishop to carry their <b>archiepiscopal</b> <b>cross</b> throughout the kingdom, not just in their own province. During the vacancy between the death of Theobald of Bec and the appointment of Becket, Roger had secured papal permission to carry his cross anywhere in England. As the Becket controversy grew, however, Alexander asked Roger to forbear from doing so, {{in order to stop}} the wrangling that had arisen from Roger's doing so. Later, Alexander revoked the privilege, claiming it had been given in error. The dispute continued between Hubert Walter and Geoffrey, respectively Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York, during King Richard I's reign, when both archbishops had their archiepiscopal crosses carried before themselves in the others diocese, prompting angry recriminations. Eventually, both prelates attempted to secure a settlement from Richard in their favour, but Richard declined, stating that this was an issue that needed to be settled by the papacy. However, no firm settlement was made until the 14th century.|$|E
