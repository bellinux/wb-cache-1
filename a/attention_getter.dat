Together, the unit would be a key cog that would help the Panthers reach the Super Bowl. As great as the defensive line was, Peppers was the clear <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> on the defensive line by opposing teams offenses, and would take on double teams to help free up his fellow defensive lineman. Peppers would finish the season with 37 solo tackles, 7 assisted tackles, 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 3 passes defensed, 4 stuffs, and 1 blocked kick, as the Panthers would go on to lose Super Bowl XXXVIII to the Patriots 29-32. Peppers and Donovan McNabb were the only people to ever play in both the NCAA men's basketball Final Four and the NFL's Super Bowl.|$|E
50|$|The {{presentation}} of baked {{fish in a}} paper envelope is about theater and spectacle. There are no purely culinary reasons to do it. The same effect can be had by baking fish {{in a shallow dish}} with a tight lid. As long as the contents can be heated quickly and most of the steam retained, you will get the same basic dish. But grand restaurants are not simply about the food. At their best, they create a sense of specialness, of celebration, of achievement, and even a bit of mystique. Great restaurants today do this. Antoine's has been doing it since the mid 19th century. The presentation en papillote is an <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> in the dining room, much like a soufflé has always been, and much like the now played-out towering architectural food of the 1990s was.|$|E
40|$|Based on two appeal {{letters from}} (i) Oxfam Hong Kong and (ii) Hong Kong Committee For United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), this paper aims {{to study the}} rhetorical choices of {{promotion}} and structural moves of two appeal letters, exploring whether the philanthropic discourse can be viewed {{in line with the}} promotional genre. The findings appear to reveal that there is a hybrid form of promotional genre in philanthropic discourse, with reference to Bhatia’s (1998) generic patterns in fund-raising discourse framework. There are similar structural moves of advertising, although the move sequences could vary. However, the move of “introducing the cause” is always found at the very beginning because the readers are more interested to realise what the main theme of the appeal letter is. In addition, appeal letters are found to be modelled in promotional genre, in which they are rhetorical choices of promotion attracting attention from readers – by using “you” and marked devices of <b>attention</b> <b>getters.</b> The findings in this study appear to be in line with the argument that promotional concerns have influenced the nature of philanthropic discourse...|$|R

40|$|Ostensive signals {{preceding}} referential cues {{are crucial}} in communication-based human knowledge acquisition processes. Since dogs {{are sensitive to}} both human ostensive and referential signals, here we investigate whether they also {{take into account the}} order of these signals and, in an object-choice task, respond to human pointing more readily when it is preceded by an ostensive cue indicating communicative intent. Adult pet dogs (n =  75) of different breeds were presented with different sequences of a three- step human action. In the relevant sequence (RS) condition, subjects were presented with an ostensive <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> (verbal addressing and eye contact), followed by referential pointing at one of two identical targets and then a non- ostensive <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> (clapping of hands). In the irrelevant sequence (IS) condition, the order of attention getters was swapped. We found that dogs chose the target indicated by pointing more frequently in the RS as compared to the IS condition. While dogs selected randomly between the target locations in the IS condition, they performed significantly better than chance in the RS condition. Based on a further control experiment (n =  22), it seems that this effect is not driven by the aversive or irrelevant nature of the non-ostensive cue. This suggests that dogs are sensitive to the order of signal sequences, and the exploitation of human referential pointing depends on the behaviour pattern in which the informing cue is embedded. © 2015, Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the development of finite complement clauses in the speech of seven English-speaking children aged 1; 2 to 5; 2. It shows that in most of children's complex utterances that seem to include a finite complement clause, the main clause does not express a full proposition; rather, it functions as an epistemic marker, <b>attention</b> <b>getter,</b> or marker of illocutionary force. The whole construction thus contains only a single proposition expressed by the apparent complement clause. As children grow older, some of the “main clauses” become more substantial and new complement-taking verbs emerge that occur with truly embedded complement clauses. However, since {{the use of these}} constructions is limited to only a few verbs, we argue that they are not yet licensed by a general schema or rule; rather, they are “constructional islands” organized around individual verbs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} the joint influences of information processing and disengagement in looking behaviour within a habituation paradigm. Six-month-old infants were habituated, during which their heart rate (HR) was measured. A parametric model of habituation yielded for each infant parameter estimates of their habituation performance. These parameters were interpreted as assessing information processing and disengagement. Corresponding measures {{were obtained from}} the HR data. The HR measures and habituation model parameter estimates were significantly correlated, as predicted. In addition, an <b>attention</b> <b>getter,</b> presented prior to each habituation trial, influenced indicators of information processing, but not of disengagement. Results confirmed the advantages of a modelling approach. In addition, and more importantly, findings led to the conclusion that both information processing as well as disengagement are involved in infants' looking behaviour in visual habituation.

Almost everyone likes fossils. They are fun to collect, interesting to Jook at, and provide a stimulus for a responsive classroom discussion about past forms of life. Both plant and animal fossils can be used. Both should be considered in the light of where they lived at t e time they were alive on earth. Most animal fossils found in the Midwest wcre deposited during past invasions of ancient seas and are thus marine organisms. The plant fossils, on the other hand, are usuall...|$|E

To date, researchers have included aspects of the criminal hoax in larger academic works. This is an original typology that sets forth the criminal hoax as a distinct part of the larger field of law and public policy. This work provides newly created definitions including four distinct categories of hoaxes: the monetary hoax, the <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> hoax, the hate crime hoax and the racial hoax. It further illustrates these types with actual detailed accounts of hoaxes and provides insights to each one. It makes policy recommendations concerning the four categories of needs: 1. legislative action, 2. a nationwide statistical database of hoax events, 3. media involvement, and 4. law enforcement training and action to deal with criminal hoaxes. Finally, it recommends further research to identify the causes and motivations of vipers. The ultimate goal of this project is to find ways to eliminate criminal hoaxes...|$|E
40|$|ATC) was {{standardised}} {{more than}} sixty years ago. Digital watermark technology for intellectual property right protection is part of many digital medias like music, pictures and videos. The EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre (EEC) proposed employing this mass-market technique to embed a digital signature as watermark in ATC voice communication. The project is called Aircraft Identification Tag (AIT). Watermarked speech allows the automatic identification of the originator of the received voice message in real-time. This AIT concept helps to increase the safety in ATC and secures the legacy voice communication system against malicious attacks. Embedding the destination address of the called aircraft into the controller’s speech would extend AIT’s safety benefit towards the aircraft by an automatically generated <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> in the cockpit when the aircraft is called. For this, active controller cooperation is required. This paper proposes {{the replacement of the}} currently used ‘Push To Talk ’ (PTT) switch by the concept of a selective PTT switch, with which the controller indicates the addressed aircraft. An early demonstrator of the selective PTT switch concept was presented to former controllers for a preliminary scenario-based evaluation of the usability. The results are positive...|$|E
40|$|It is very {{essential}} for student teachers to convey clear instructions during their microteaching class to prepare themselves {{better in the}} real teaching process at school. Student teachers need to have specific techniques to give instruction. The most advantageous technique is gesture because gesture can clarify unclear teacher talk and give visual aids in comprehending the instruction. Specifically, conversational hand gestures are associated to promote students’ better understanding {{that may lead to}} better involvement in the class activity. There are four types of conversational hand gestures {{that can be used to}} mediate instruction: iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat. This study aims to find out the types and the way how conversational hand gestures are enacted by student teachers to give the instruction. This study is qualitative descriptive design with naturalistic approach. In particular, 4 student teachers in four different microteaching classes were analyzed by videotaping them during their teaching practice. The student teachers were interviewed to support the data. Based on the findings and the discussion, this research figured out that the conversational hand gestures are supportively enacted in five different organizational steps: (1) beat and iconic gestures as an <b>attention</b> <b>getter,</b> (2) deictic, iconic, and beat gestures in delivering the direction of the instruction, (3) iconic, deictic, and beat gestures in mediating to explain expectation, (4) deictic, iconic, and beat gestures in restating the instruction, and (5) deictic and beat gestures in following up the instruction. Furthermore, the findings showed that there were only three out of four gestures that commonly used by student teachers to give instruction: deictic, iconic and beat gestures. Therefore, it can be concluded that student teachers have enacted the conversational hand gestures to support the instruction and help students understand the instruction better...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{purpose of}} this study was to record on tape and to analyze the sonagrams of the {{complete}} repertoire of the vocalizations of the Rufous-sided Towhee, Pipilo erythrophthalmus oregonus. Meanings were assigned to a number of the calls. Sounds of nestlings, juveniles, and vocalizations connected with parental care were not included in this study. The following advertising songs were noted in the male only: 1. Full song, one or two introductory notes followed by a fast trill. 2. Introductory note, often used alone or in pairs. 3. Fast trill. 4. Medium trill. 5. Slow trill. With the exception of the Thup note, heard only from the male, and the Kip note, heard only from the female, all call notes were heard from both sexes. The complete list of calls, with meanings assigned where possible, is as follows: 1. Chirp, primarily an <b>attention</b> <b>getter.</b> 2. Meow, usually indicative of the presence of a disturbing factor. 3. See, highly variable, presumably a contact call. 4. Chip, intense fear, alarm note. 5. Thup, contentment. 6. Tzip, frustration or impatience. 7. Tsk, frequent component of secondary song. 8. Chatter, sexual desire. 9. Kip, a post-copulatory note. 10. Slur note, important component of secondary song, also may indicate mild distress. 11. Twitter, used mainly in secondary song. Secondary songs are the softly whispered, usually complex, vocalizations by both sexes, heard only at very close range. Their extreme complexity and variability indicate that they serve some purpose other than to convey information. It is suggested that while advertising song, serving as an isolating mechanism, would diverge in form as part of the process of speciation, the call notes and the secondary songs are likely to remain unchanged. Thus sibling species should have unlike songs but similar call notes and secondary songs. Should this prove to be the case, studies of entire vocal repertoires could prove useful in the study of phylogeny...|$|E
40|$|Public {{communication}} {{or public}} speaking by using “speech” {{is one of}} good {{ways to improve the}} skill of communication, especially in speaking skill. Because most people tend to be anxious before doing something important in front of public, such as in giving a speech, outline is essential and suggested to use for the speaker to get an effective speaking. Speech outline is one of several things to prepare before conducting speech. Making a speech outline will be easy if the speakers make a mind map by organizing the material to develop the ideas. That is why the researcher stated some theories behind the scene to get a correct speech outline. It will give a lot of advantages to the speakers. The research design used in this research was descriptive qualitative. The populations were 12 intermediate level students who are joining speech activity as their extracurricular at Pondok Pesantren Nurul Jadid. The instrument was document analysis. The documents were the speech outline of the students who joined speech activity at that school. Based on both 9 simple rules for outlining speech and 7 parts of outline, {{the number of students who}} stated title in their speech outline were 12 students. On the other hand, there were no students who stated a specific purpose and thesis statement (purpose and central idea in 7 parts of outline). 9 students stated an introduction, 12 students stated body of the outline and 9 students stated a conclusion. The number of students who used an <b>attention</b> <b>getter</b> were 8 students and those who used a preview were 5 students. No student indented and labeled the main points of speech but there were 11 students labeled their sub points of their speech although they did not indent them. There were 9 students stated a summary and 1 student stated a memorable closing statement in their conclusion. There were no students stated bibliography and visual aids in their last speech outline. In summary, after analyzing the speech outline, the researcher found that all students did not use the format of speech outline, either based on 9 simple rules for outlining speech or 7 parts of outline. The researcher also found that speech outline that was made by the students of Pondok Pesantren Nurul Jadid need some suggestions and improvements based on the theory used. ...|$|E

She has bipolar disorder that has been well managed with medication, in different combinations at different pOints in her illness. However, {{over the last month}} she has intermittently missed doses and is consequently becoming unwell. It is puzzling that she is missing doses because she is very attached to her child and last time she stopped medication her daughter was placed in care. The following information was obtained from her in order to undertake a functional analysis. Financially, Angela was managing well on her supporting parent benefit and the maintenance paid by the father of her child. However, her former partner was sent to jail 3 months ago and the maintenance money he was sending her dried up. As a consequence, she started falling behind in some bills about 8 weeks ago. She has told you that this worries her. On top of this, her daughter started experiencing stomach aches last week and is cranky most of the time. Angela has said that she thinks that her daughter may be lactose intolerant and believes that her local GP did not take her concerns about her daughter 2 ̆ 7 s distress seriously enough when she took her to see him 10 days ago. Since becoming involved with Sam, Angela has struggled to keep a routine for her and her daughter and she says she forgets her medication from time to time.
