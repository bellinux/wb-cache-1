From May to August 1964, Holmes was on vacation so his Deputy Director, Terence Dare Sorby, acted for his position during his absence. By July of the same year, then Governor Sir David Trench reorganised the Legislative Council and the holder of the Director of Commerce and Industry was admitted to the Council as an official member.

40|$|Background: The Australian Iron <b>Status</b> <b>Advisory</b> Panel advocates dietary {{intervention}} as {{the first}} treatment option for mild iron deficiency [serum ferritin (SF) = 10 - 15 mug/L]. However, {{there appear to be}} no studies on the efficacy of dietary treatment for iron deficiency. Objective: We compared the effects of iron supplementation and of a high-iron diet on serum ferritin (SF) and hemoglobin in iron-deficient women of childbearing age. Design: Forty-four iron-deficient women (SF 68 mu mol/L) and 22 iron-replete women (hemoglobin {{greater than or equal to}} 120 g/L and SF > 20 mug/L) matched for age and parity categories were enrolled and completed 7 -d weighed food records at baseline. The iron-deficient women were randomly allocated to receive iron supplementation (105 mg/d; supplement group) or a high-iron diet (recommended intake of absorbable iron: 2. 25 mg/d; diet group) for 12 wk. Hematologic and dietary assessments were repeated at the end of the intervention and again after a 6 -mo follow-up. Results: Mean SF in the supplement group increased from 9. 0 +/- 3. 9 mug/L at baseline to 24. 8 +/- 10. 0 mug/L after the intervention and remained stable during follow-up (24. 2 +/- 9. 8 mug/L whereas the diet group had smaller increases during the intervention (8. 9 +/- 3. 1 to 11. 0 +/- 5. 9 mug/L) but continued to improve during follow-up (to 15. 2 +/- 9. 5 mug/L). Mean hemoglobin tended to improve in both intervention groups, but the change was only significant in the supplement group. Conclusions: In iron-deficient women of childbearing age, a high-iron diet produced smaller increases in SF than did iron supplementation but resulted in continued improvements in iron status during a 6 -mo follow-up...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Survival after {{metastatic cancer}} has {{improved}} {{at the cost}} of increased presentation with metastatic spinal disease. For patients with pathologic spinal fractures and/or spinal cord compression, surgical intervention may relieve pain and improve quality of life. Surgery is generally considered to be inappropriate if anticipated survival is, 3 months. The aim of this international multicenter study was to analyze data from patients who died within 3 months or 2 years after surgery, to identify preoperative factors associated with poor or good survival, and to avoid inappropriate selection of patients for surgery in the future. Patients and Methods A total of 1, 266 patients underwent surgery for impending pathologic fractures and/or neurologic deficits and were prospectively observed. Data collected included tumor characteristics, preoperative fitness (American Society of Anesthesiologists <b>advisory</b> [ASA]), neurologic <b>status</b> (Frankel scale), performance (Karnofsky performance score [KPS]), and quality of life (EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire [EQ- 5 D]). Outcomes were survival at 3 months and 2 years postsurgery. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to find preoperative factors associated with short-term and long-term survival. Results In univariable analysis, age, emergency surgery, KPS, EQ- 5 D, ASA, Frankel, and Tokuhashi/Tomita scores were significantly associated with short survival. In multivariable analysis, KPS and age were significantly associated with short survival (odds ratio [OR], 1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 15 to 1. 62; and OR, 1. 14; 95 % CI, 1. 02 to 1. 27, respectively). Associated with longer survival in univariable analysis were age, number of levels included in surgery, KPS, EQ- 5 D, Frankel, and Tokuhashi/Tomita scores. In multivariable analysis, the number of levels included in surgery (OR, 1. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 06 to 1. 38) and primary tumor type were significantly associated with longer survival. Conclusion Poor performance status at presentation is the strongest indicator of poor short-term survival, whereas low disease load and favorable tumor histology are associated with longer-term survival.

40|$|Companies must receive {{marketing}} authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{before they}} can begin commercial distribution of {{a new type of}} medical device in the United States. The premarket approval application (PMA) is the process by which this occurs. Companies submit a PMA after they have completed laboratory test, animal studies and human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for a specific condition, or therapeutic indication. Despite legislation {{in the early part of}} this decade to reduce the timeframe for FDA review of PMAs, these timeframes continue to vary dramatically and unpredictably from months to many years. The focus of this thesis is to examine factors which influence this timeframe. Hypotheses about factors that impact PMA review timeframes were developed by analyzing the review process and through interviews with industry representatives and FDA officials. The following factors were evaluated: year of submission to FDA, size of firm seeking approval, presence of prior approved PMAs by firm seeking approval, product category, first-of-a-kind device, number of amendments, expedited review <b>status,</b> <b>advisory</b> panel review, unanimous advisory panel vote, and confirmation of primary efficacy endpoints in pivotal clinical trials. The year of submission was considered a control variable. The other factors fall into one of three categories: applicant characteristics, device characteristics, and process characteristics. Analysis was limited to PMAs received by FDA from 2000 through 2005. Two levels of analysis were conducted. (cont.) First, the directional impact of each factor on PMA review time was evaluated. Second, regression analysis was used to develop predictive models for PMA review time, in days, and to test which factors have meaningful associations when controlling for other factors. Factors that have highly statistically significant associations with longer review timeframes include: a larger number of amendments, and designation as an orthopedic device. Designation as an orthopedic device has a particularly dramatic impact on PMA review time. Orthopedic devices have a mean PMA review time of 647 days, 240 days longer (66 % more) than the average for all other categories combined. Even after controlling for process, device, and applicant factors, the impact of an orthopedic designation remains large, increasing the review time by 175 days (p< 0. 01). In a univariate regression model, each additional amendment is associated with 20. 2 additional days (p< 0. 0001) of review time. After controlling for other factors, each additional amendment is associated with 17. 5 additional days (p< 0. 0001) of review time. Although the number of amendments cannot be known - or predicted - in advance of PMA submission, its significance (R-squared of 0. 25 in a univariate regression model) in predicting PMA review timeframes reinforces the notion that quality - primarily of the dossier, in terms of its organization, clarity and completeness, but also of the adequacy of the underlying data to substantiate safety and effectiveness - is critically important to the achieving a shorter PMA review time. Only one factor has an association that in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. PMAs with an expedited review status have mildly longer PMA review times, by 37 days, than those that were not expedited. (cont.) This result can be explained in part by the larger number of amendments on these PMAs (corr= 0. 32). When controlling for the number of amendments and other important factors, an expedited review designation has a significant impact on PMA review timeframes in the opposite, but hypothesized direction - it shortens PMA review times by 146 days (p< 0. 01). by Inder Raj Singh.
