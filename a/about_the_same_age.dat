All children were enrolled or on a waiting list to be enrolled in a preschool program in the Cache Valley area. A parent questionnaire and environmental assessment were utilized to determine whether a) the physical environment, b) behaviors of parents, and c) birth order of children is related to development of print awareness as measured by a print awareness test.

Major findings suggest that the behaviors that reflect parents 2 ̆ 7 attitudes regarding literacy are most important in the development of their children 2 ̆ 7 s print awareness.

40|$|Abstract: q’Ar-”Ar incremental-heating spectra {{analyses}} {{were made of}} five microgabbro dykes from the Falkland Islands, two of which yielded an acceptable plateau, and a third a close maximum estimate. All three indicate an age of dyke intrusion of about 190 Ma, supporting a single, published K-Ar date.

By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent.

40|$|Background & Aims: Cancer {{risks for}} {{mismatch}} repair gene mutation carriers have been derived almost exclusively using families ascertained owing to their strong cancer family history. These may be overestimates, due to analytic problems, and not generalizable. We estimated average cancer risks for mutations identified in population-based early onset colorectal cancer cases (probands) unselected for family history. Methods: Data were cancer histories and mutation status (carrier, non-carrier, or unknown) of 17 mismatch repair gene mutation carrier probands with colorectal cancer diagnosed before age 45 (8 hMLH 1, 4 hMSH 2, 4 hMSH 6, 1 hPMS 2) and their first- and second-degree relatives. We used modified segregation analysis theory, adjusting {{for the family}} being ascertained through the proband being an early onset mutation carrier. Results: Eleven carrier probands (64 %) were from families meeting the Amsterdam II criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The cumulative risk for colorectal cancer (95 % confidence interval) to age 70 was 45 % (29 %- 62 %) for men and 38 % (19 %- 51 %) for women. Corresponding risks were 67 % (47 %- 84 %) and 72 % (48 %- 85 %) for any hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-related cancer. Compared with the general population, colorectal cancer incidence for men was approximately 180 -fold higher before <b>age</b> 50, but <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after <b>age</b> 50. For women, incidence was approximately 100 -fold higher before age 50 and 7 -fold higher thereafter. Conclusions: For carriers of the mutations in the mismatch repair genes that cause early onset colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer increases rapidly until age 50, and the incidence decreases to general population levels at older ages. © 2006 American Gastroenterological Association...|$|R

A draft project was presented in July 1976 by J. Andrews, University of Hawaii and G. Pautot, Cnexo on a joint survey under the name of: "Hawaii-Tahiti Transect program". Further details were worked on in September 1976 during the International Geological Congress in Sydney with the participation of D.

The scientific final program was established in July 1977, planning on the participation of three research vessels: the Suroit (CNEXO), the Kana Keoki (U. of Hawaii) and the Sonne (Aachen TU). Several survey areas were selected across the Pacific Ocean (Areas A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) with <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> crustal <b>age</b> (<b>about</b> 40 million years) and a similar water depths.

40|$|We have {{performed}} a {{detailed study of}} the morphology and kinematics of the hourglass-shaped nebula around the blue supergiant Sher 25 in the galactic giant HII region NGC 3603. Near-infrared high resolution adaptive optics images in the Br gamma line and HST/NICMOS images in the HeI 1. 08 mu line were compared with iso-velocity maps in the H alpha and [NII] lines. The adaptive optics observations clearly resolved {{the width of the}} ring (0. 9 ", i. e., 0. 027 pc), yielding delta R / R = 1 : 8. We show that the H alpha and [NII] lines trace the entire silhouette of the hourglass. The bipolar lobes of the hourglass expand at 70 km/s, whereas the ring around the waist of the hourglass expands at 30 km/s. Both the ring and the bipolar lobes have <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dynamical <b>age,</b> indicating a common origin and a major outburst and mass-loss event 6630 yr ago. The ionized mass within the hourglass is between 0. 3 Mo and 0. 6 Mo - quite comparable to the total mass suggested for the expanding (pre-supernova) shell around SN 1987 A. The hourglass structure around Sher 25 {{is similar to that of}} SN 1987 A in spatial extent, mass, and velocities. The major differences between these two nebulae might arise from environmental effects. Both internal and external ionization sources are available for Sher 25 's nebula. Furthermore, Sher 25 and its hourglass-shaped nebula appear to be moving to the south-west with respect to the ambient interstellar medium, and ram pressure has apparently deformed the hourglass. We conclude that the circumstellar nebulae around SN 1987 A and Sher 25 are very similar and define a new class of nebulae around blue supergiants in their final evolutionary stage.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{frequency}} of chromosome aberrations in the lymphocytes of three established heterozygotes for the Bloom's syndrome gene (ages 67, 57, 46) {{was compared to}} that in controls (ages 68, 67, 61, 46, 34). The {{main part of the}} study was done on coded slides. No difference was found between the heterozygotes and the control group, except for one control (aged 46) who had a significantly higher number of chromosome aberrations than the others. Individuals with Bloom's syndrome, which is caused by an autosomal recessive gene (bi), have a tendency to chromosomal abnormalities and a predisposition to malignant disease (German, 1969). Whether chromosome breakage and incidence of cancer are also increased in heterozygotes is so far an open question. It has been reported that bl/+ cells may show an increase in chromosome breakage and the {{frequency of}} mitotic chiasmata (symmetrical, homo-logous chromatid exchanges) as compared with + 1 + cells (German, 1969, 1972, 1973 a, b). Hustinx et al. (1977), on the other hand, found {{no significant difference in the}} frequency of chromosome aberra-tions between four heterozygotes and normal people, and no mitotic chiasmata were observed in 592 heterozygote cells. In the present study, three known heterozygotes from a family with two members with Bloom's syndrome have been compared with controls of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> average <b>age.</b> <b>The</b> family is not of Jewish origin, and the parents are second cousins (Fig. 1). Materials and methods Lymphocyte cultures were prepared according to a modification of the usual Moorhead technique, and the slides were stained with azur A. The following people were investigated (Fig. 1) : (1) The parents (IV. 1 and IV. 2) of two children with Bloom's syndrome (cases 22 and 23 in German, 1969). Cytogenetic observations on these patients have been reported by Kuhn (1974, 1976, 1978) and by Therman and Kuhn (1976); (2) the maternal grandparents (111. 1 and 111. 2). The grandmother is a known hetero-zygote, while the grandfather is unrelated and ma...|$|R
