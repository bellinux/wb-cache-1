40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{frequently}} observed adverse reactions of a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B (LAB) {{on the first}} dose of fever and rigors are, hypokalemia and renal toxicity. Acute pancreatitis is not listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics of LAB, although some non-severe cases of pancreatitis toxicity after LAB are described in the literature. CASE SUMMARY: We present {{the case of an}} 88 -year-old male with not known allergies and diagnosed with arterial hypertension and Grade III chronic kidney disease. One month before was admitted because of pneumonia, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation and pancytopenia; he was discharged on January 13, 2016, and two weeks later, he returned to the Urgency Department with severe deterioration of the general condition, fever, and a skin rash, these symptoms were attributed to a delayed allergic reaction to levofloxacin. During his first admission, he was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, digoxin, metamizole, pantoprazole, valsartan/amlodipine. The Lab results showed pancytopenia. It was performed a bone marrow aspiration, suggesting a case of leishmaniasis. It was initiated intravenous treatment with LAB at 3 mg / kg / day. The first day of treatment, the patient showed a severe bronchospasm, exacerbation of the previous rash possibly caused by quinolones treatment, was treated with corticosteroids, antihistamines, aerosol therapy and oxygen therapy until full recovery. During the following days, LAB was administrated at a slow infusion rate and premedication with appropriate tolerance. On the fifth day of the treatment, the patient started with a diffuse abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting. The amylase lab result was 431 IU/L. An <b>abdominal</b> <b>scanner</b> showed edematous pancreatitis. After 48 hours the amylase and lipase lab values were normal. And the <b>abdominal</b> <b>Scanner</b> was repeated with no changes. The evolution of patient was aggravating until reaching multiple organs failure a few days later the patient died. CONCLUSION: We have described the first case report of pancreatitis LAB-induced resulting in death...|$|E

At the same time the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed grade II esophageal varices. We have maintained oral anticoagulation therapy. This case highlights that an early effective anticoagulation heparin therapy is needed for a clear benefit in case of suspected PSMVT. It is certain that the sooner the treatment is given, the better outcome will be...|$|R
40|$|Apc mutant (Apc(Min)) mice develop {{multiple}} adenomas {{in their}} intestines and {{are widely used}} to study colorectal carcinogenesis and chemopreventive approaches. Molecular imaging of intestinal adenomas could potentially provide noninvasive longitudinal evaluation of these lesions in living mice. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the role of F- 18 -FDG PET in the Apc(Min) mouse model. Methods: Apc(Min) mice (n = 8) fed a purified diet were imaged serially after injection of F- 18 -FDG at age 9 and 12 wk using a small-animal PET <b>scanner.</b> <b>Abdominal</b> uptake of the tracer was quantified. After dissection, intestines were imaged separately, and intestinal tracer uptake was quantified. Tracer distribution was compared with results from microscopic examination regarding adenoma number and size. Thereafter, findings were validated serially in 20 Apc(Min) mice aged 6, 8, 10, and 12 wk that received standard chow to increase adenoma numbers. In vivo abdominal F- 18 -FDG uptake was correlated with microscopy results. Results: Microscopic examination showed that the mice developed 25 - 35 intestinal adenomas at age 12 wk. Ex vivo F- 18 -FDG PET of the dissected intestines visualized all large adenomas and most small adenomas. Ex vivo total intestinal F- 18 -FDG uptake correlated with in vivo total abdominal uptake and with the number of large adenomas at age 9 and 12 wk. At 12 wk, there was a clear correlation between in vivo abdominal tracer uptake and the number of large adenomas but not the total number of lesions. Conclusion: Intestinal adenomas in Apc(Min) mice are metabolically active lesions that take up F- 18 -FDG. Abdominal 18 F-FDG uptake at age 12 wk serves as a readout modality for large intestinal adenomas...|$|R
