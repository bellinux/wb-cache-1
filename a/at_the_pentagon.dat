Next, off-resonant third order susceptibilities are investigated. We find that third order susceptibilities of higher fullerenes are a few times larger than those of C 60. The magnitude of nonlinearity increases as the optical gap decreases in higher fullerenes. The nonlinearity is nearly proportional to the fourth power of the carbon number when the onsite Coulomb repulsion is 2 t or 4 t, t being the nearest neighbor hopping integral. This result, indicating important roles of Coulomb interactions, agrees with quantum chemical calculations of higher fullerenes. 1.
