5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those {{who were members of}} Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E

5|$|He had eleven known children, all by Elizabeth. His eldest son, and heir, John, Earl of Lincoln (c. 1462–16 June 1487), eventually, due to King Richard III {{losing his}} own son, became heir to his {{maternal}} uncle's throne. Following Richard's death at Bosworth Field, Lincoln rebelled {{against the new}} king Henry VII, and himself was killed at the Battle of Stoke. John de la Pole's second son, Geoffrey, was born circa 1464, but died young. Next, Edward (1466–1485) joined the church and became Archdeacon of Richmond. John de la Pole's first daughter, Elizabeth (c. 1468–1489), married Henry Lovel, 8th Baron Morley (1466–1489), and had no issue. John's dukedom descended to his fourth son, Edmund (1471–30 April 1513), who had to bargain energetically with the king and pay a substantial amount before it was granted. He eventually became a Yorkist pretender to Henry VIII's crown, who had him beheaded. Another daughter, Dorothy, {{who was born in}} 1472, died young, whilst next, Humphrey (1474–1513) took Holy Orders, while Anne (1476–1495) became a nun. John's final daughter, Katherine (c. 1477–1513), made a good marriage to William, Baron Stourton, with whom she had no issue. John de la Pole's two youngest sons both seem to have been involved in a plot against Henry VII that was discovered in 1501. Sir William de la Pole, of Wingfield Castle (1478–1539) was imprisoned in the Tower of London, for thirty-seven years. Before this he had married Katherine Stourton; she was twenty years older than him, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> issue. The youngest son, Richard de la Pole (1480–1525), managed to escape to France on the discovery of the 1501 plot. Taking part in France's campaigns during the Italian Wars, he was killed at the Battle of Pavia, 24 February 1525.|$|E
