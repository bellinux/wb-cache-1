5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> bloke.|$|E

25|$|It {{would later}} be {{revealed}} {{that he was the}} younger (and less worthy; the black sheep) brother of the true count, who was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> guy. The real Count had mysteriously disappeared, an act supposedly engineered (but could not be proven) by his nastier brother, so that he could become the count. With his brother's disappearance, he claimed everything.|$|E

25|$|Any {{reference}} {{in the script}} to the devastation caused by the Allied bombings was removed. In the script, Shukichi remarks to Onodera’s wife in Kyoto that her city is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> place, unlike Tokyo, with all its ruins. The censors deleted the reference to ruins (as an implied critique of the Allies) and, in the finished film, the word “hokorippoi” (“dusty”) was substituted as a description of Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{actively}} visited {{areas in}} the path of totality had perfect weather. Many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse, with many or all effects visible, and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> corona, despite the proximity to the solar minimum. The partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the International Space Station, where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moon's shadow on Earth's surface. It initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of March would bring the ISS into the path of totality, but this correction was postponed.|$|E

She is again mistaken for a boy in Grandmère's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> person, as she asked if Mia was alright after Michael announces he is moving to Japan, and, though shocked by Mia's new haircut in book eight, says nothing about it. She is also {{surprisingly}} strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is continually implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed but in the eleventh book Perin and Ling Su become a couple and together run The Frank Gianini Community center.|$|E

25|$|Indiana {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball and move into Badgers territory. Indiana QB Nate Sudfeld then threw a deep pass that was intercepted by CB Sojourn Shelton at the Wisconsin 7-yard line. On the first play from {{scrimmage}} for the Badgers, RB James White ran 93 yards for the touchdown. On Indiana's second possession, a fumbled snap was recovered by OLB Brendan Kelly at the Indiana 14-yard line. The Badgers would score three plays later on a Melvin Gordon 1-yard touchdown run. Indiana was forced to punt and Wisconsin would settle for a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Another punt for the Hoosiers and the Badgers would again {{have to settle for}} a field goal, this time it was a 36-yard field goal by Jack Russell. Indiana would have the ball near midfield as the first quarter came to a close with Wisconsin leading 20–0. Indiana's drive stalled at about midfield and gave the ball back to Wisconsin. The Badgers would then be forced to punt for the first time of the game. After an Indiana three–and–out, Wisconsin took over at their own 7-yard line. The Badgers put together <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> 9 plays 93 yard scoring drive that was capped with a 32-yard touchdown run by WR Jared Abbrederis. The Hoosier and Badgers would exchange punts as Indiana then closed out the half by running out the clock. The Badgers led 27–0 at halftime.|$|E

[...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's got <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it just makes for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E

Theroux stated, [...] "I think that the pastor is not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> person. I think he's an angry person who's twisted the Bible and picked and chosen verses that support his anger, that sort of justify his anger, and he's instilled that in his children and they've {{passed it on to}} their children. Although the second and third generation are by and large quite nice people from what I saw, they still live under the influence of their Gramps." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the Second World War, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, {{circulated}} the Trout memo, a paper that compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The historian Ben Macintyre observes that although the paper was published under Godfrey's name, it [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", Godfrey's personal assistant. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> one)"; it was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.|$|E
500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. We must have done something right." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} almost universally praised by critics. [...] Abby West of Entertainment Weekly complimented {{the writing of}} B.J. Novak in the episode, saying that [...] "This was another gem... kept <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> light touch on the whole love {{triangle}} thing, only giving us that one wonderfully uncomfortable moment at Pam's desk when they were betting on how many jelly beans were in the container." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski rated it 10 out of 10, making it only one of two third-season episodes he deemed a [...] "masterpiece". He stated that [...] "Another truly brilliant episode of The Office aired this week, with more humor packed into the half-hour than you get in many feature-length comedies." [...] Zoromski also praised the acting by minor characters, such as Creed Bratton and Mindy Kaling, who portrays customer service representative Kelly Kapoor.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave {{a glowing}} review, giving the episode a 9 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} [...] "amazing." [...] He wrote that [...] "most of the major mysteries established this season are given a satisfying and proper conclusion." [...] He praised how the episode combined all the second season storylines, including the mysteries and the Neptune High portion of Veronica's life. [...] "The final scenes do <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> job of closing the high school chapter of the Veronica Mars story, while also leaving plenty {{of questions about the}} future of some characters in particular." [...] Goldman also lauded the performances of Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni, writing that [...] "As always, Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni knock it out of the park, with Bell especially having to go through a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions, all of which she does spectacularly." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he {{received}} a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond, calling it [...] "a lady's gun – and not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> lady at that!" [...] Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a Walther PPK 7.65mm and this exchange of arms made it to Dr. No. Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains. In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in Dr. No, M introduces him to Bond as [...] "the greatest small-arms expert in the world". Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in [...] "For Your Eyes Only" [...] and a Winchester [...]308 target rifle in [...] "The Living Daylights". Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt [...]45 Army Special.|$|E

When asked why he decided to participate, Warren Buffett said. “In <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> way, Powell gets {{all the rest of}} us to work quite hard.” [...] Part of Goldman Sachs' rationale for these two publicized programs was to repair its image following the 2008 global financial crisis.|$|R

[...] The end of the episode [...] "What If..." [...] features an onscreen tribute to Bill Paxton, who died in February 2017 and had portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season.

500|$|Jan Hooks reprised {{her role}} as Manjula in the episode. In a scene in the episode, Apu and Manjula are arguing in an Indian language. During the scene, both {{characters}} speak the language accurately, as both Hooks and Hank Azaria (the voice of Apu) were given a phonetic transcription of their lines. The singing parrot that Apu sends to Manjula was voiced by series main cast member Nancy Cartwright, who also portrays Bart in the series. The episode features singer sir Elton John as himself. John's lines were recorded by current showrunner Al Jean, who found working with John being a [...] "wonderful experience". [...] "Elton John was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> person," [...] Scully spoke for Jean in the DVD commentary for the episode, since Jean was busy during the commentary record. [...] "He was a great sport and worked really hard for the show."

500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> man... he may not have known exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old. We need to send it to an earlier generation." ...|$|E

Sir Tom Finney said of Morrison, [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> fellow who was quite unassuming. He was very popular with the fans and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good player.
