5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be cast the other way <b>about,</b> <b>but</b> Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (<b>about</b> , <b>but</b> along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within <b>about</b> , <b>but</b> their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E
60|$|I beg you to {{remember}} these words. If you believe the Bible to be inspired, you are bound to take its words as they stand. And therefore I beg you {{to remember}} that St. Paul preached not <b>about</b> UNrighteousness, <b>but</b> righteousness; not <b>about</b> INtemperance, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> temperance; not <b>about</b> hell, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> judgment to come; in a word, not <b>about</b> wrong, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> right. I hope that {{does not seem to}} you a small matter. I hope that none of you are ready to say, 'It comes to the same thing in the end.' It does not come to the same thing. There is no use in telling a man what is wrong, unless you first tell him what is right. There is no use rebuking a man for being bad, unless you first tell him how he may become better, and give him hope for himself, or you will only drive him to recklessness and despair. You must show him the right road, before you can complain of him for going the wrong one.|$|R

5|$|Kesselring's memoirs were {{published}} in 1953, as Soldat bis zum letzten Tag (A Soldier to the Last Day). They were reprinted in English as A Soldier's Record a year later. Although written {{while he was in}} prison, without access to his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought <b>about</b> <b>but</b> never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg (Thoughts on the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|Marginal {{wind shear}} {{disrupted}} the system's organization, and it passed north of Puerto Rico without further development, with winds dropping below gale-force on August25. Initially, the system moved quickly westward with a forward speed averaging <b>about</b> , <b>but</b> slowed down considerably after the northern {{portion of the}} wave split off on August26. The low pressure area crossed the southern Bahamas with scattered convection, becoming more defined on August 27 while moving near the northern Cuban coast. Wind shear prevented quicker development, although conditions became more favorable closer to the Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, the convection increased and became more organized. Later that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation. Based on the observations and the convective organization, {{it is estimated that}} Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00UTC on August28 while situated about 60mi (100km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida.|$|E

A composite company drawn from the HV 114th Infantry Brigade attacked VRS positions on the right flank of the advance. The 7th Guards Brigade managed to move forward by <b>about</b> , <b>but</b> had to suspend its effort as the 114th Brigade company could not defeat the VRS' entrenched defences at Marino Brdo to cover the 7th Brigade's right flank. The VRS defences were well prepared all along the front line attacked by the HV and the HVO. The Bosansko Grahovo zone was particularly well prepared for defencefortifications, shelters and covered trenches were built to establish defence in depth, with obstacles, including minefields, in between them.|$|E

5|$|When {{the issue}} of secession reached a crisis, Cleburne sided with the Southern states. His choice was not due to any love of slavery, which he claimed not to care <b>about,</b> <b>but</b> out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted {{him as one of}} their own. As the crisis mounted, Cleburne joined the local militia company (the Yell Rifles) as a private soldier. He was soon elected captain. He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal in Little Rock in January 1861. When Arkansas left the Union, the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry, later {{designated}} the 15th Arkansas, of which he was elected Colonel.
