This {{was changed}} (starting in February 2000) to <b>a</b> space-saving <b>spare</b> tire, to reduce weight {{to keep the}} car in the midsize class per government specifications. However, the spare tire well in all LS models still has space for <b>a</b> full-sized <b>spare.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the {{original}} negatives are lost, {{the closest to}} an original print is <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> negative stored in Paramount's vaults. Suffering from decay and defects, the negative was fully restored with modern technology. For the restored version of Wings, {{the original}} music score was re-orchestrated. The sound effects were recreated at Skywalker Sound using archived audio tracks. The scenes using the Handschiegl color process were also recreated for the restored version.|$|E

Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor directs Amy to write the note {{that led him to}} Craig's house, using a red pen in his jacket; she rummages around and finds the {{engagement}} ring from her husband-to-be, Rory, whom she had forgotten after he was consumed by the crack in space and time and erased from existence. A similar crack appears behind Craig's refrigerator, and widens.|$|E

50|$|Sources differ as to {{the service}} of Riquelme in the Chilean Navy. While some sources state that Riquelme was an {{operational}} commissioned unit from 1966 until 1973, when she was used as <b>a</b> source of <b>spare</b> parts for her three sister ships; Serrano (APD-26) (ex-), Orella (APD-27) (ex-), and Virgilio Uribe (APD-29) (ex-), other sources claim that Riqulme was never an operational vessel in the Chilean Navy, being only used as <b>a</b> <b>spares</b> source.|$|R

5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|The Chadian {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} sprinter Kaltouma Nadjina in the women's 400 metres, who had previously competed for the nation at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Nadjina had trained in the United States and Canada, under an International Olympic Committee scholarship. But after refusing to move from Canada to Senegal following the 2000 Games, she lost her funding, and lived in <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> room of her coach John Cannon's house in Vancouver. Prior to the 2004 Games, she had considered switching her allegiance from Chad to Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E

5|$|The Premier League {{maintains}} two trophies – {{the genuine}} trophy (held by the reigning champions) and <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> replica. Two trophies {{are held in}} the event that two different clubs could win the League {{on the final day of}} the season. In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season – then a replica won by a previous club is used.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} {{comprises}} an entry hallway and two rooms. The hallways is set with tessellated tiles {{and still has}} the original desk for the visitor's book. Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was {{stranded}} on Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} mechanical problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to build a replica Sea Lion at the Amberley Museum Railway, home of Polar Bear, using the frames of 1953-built Wingrove & Rogers loco no. 5031, which has been used at Amberley as <b>a</b> <b>spares</b> donor. The replica would be built initially as a static exhibit, {{with the potential for}} it to be made operational.|$|R

5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|Akane {{explains}} that Sigma, after his abduction in 2028, had his consciousness transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The {{goal of the}} AB project was to enable the elder Sigma to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. Sigma, as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi is kept in cold sleep. Sigma creates Kyle as <b>a</b> <b>spare,</b> in case his own body gets damaged. When they again arrive at 2074, Sigma and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when {{he stopped at the}} side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Old Bay Line's {{dissolution}} in April 1962, three ships remained docked at the Pratt Street pier: the District of Columbia, which had been kept as <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> since the Washington–Norfolk service ended in 1957, was scrapped soon afterwards. The City of Richmond was sold for use as a floating restaurant in the Virgin Islands, but sank in the Atlantic Ocean off Georgetown, South Carolina, while under tow to her new home. The City of Norfolk was idled in Norfolk until 1966, when it was towed to Fieldsboro, New Jersey on the Delaware River and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|Gill {{played in}} almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the {{following}} October, but lost his place soon afterwards through injury. Though he did then receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept <b>a</b> <b>spare</b> one back, which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, {{it became clear that}} his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
