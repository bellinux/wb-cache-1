5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on <b>a</b> <b>Colorado</b> highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E

5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, North American pre-release {{tracking}} estimated that the film would gross between $30$38million, making it the number-one film during its opening weekend. Other tracking showed that up to 17% of North American audiences were reluctant to visit cinemas following the mass shootings in <b>a</b> <b>Colorado</b> cinema in late July 2012, which might affect ticket sales. The Expendables 2 earned $10.5million on its opening day; during its opening weekend, the film earned $28.59million in 3,316 theaters (an average of $8,622 per theater) finishing as the weekend's number-one film. The gross was 18% lower than The Expendables $34.8million opening in 2010. The largest demographic for its opening weekend was male (63%) over age 25 (65%). During its second weekend, the movie held the number-one spot with $13.4million. By its third weekend, analysis showed that the film's gross had fallen behind the original {{at the same time}} in its release by $16million.|$|E
5|$|With little {{guidance}} on water allocation from the Supreme Court, {{proponents of the}} dam feared endless litigation. <b>A</b> <b>Colorado</b> attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, {{with the approval of}} Congress. Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.|$|E
