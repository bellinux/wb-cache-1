In 1999 Electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable “pay-per-wash” {{service in}} Sweden, failing to succeed {{because of a}} myopic marketing approach. New energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by Electrolux among consumers. Electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the Internet {{and took care of}} the disposal and upgrading of the machines. Consumers did not pay for the machines themselves; they were only charged with a small installation fee at the beginning, and through a pay-per-wash charging system (10 Swedish kronor (about 1 $) per wash). However, an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service, achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values, failed to convince the consumers. According to A. Ottmann et al. not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by Electrolux: convenience of pay-per-wash, including easy trade-ins for upgrades, free service and saved money of a new washing machine. In addition, the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features.|$|E

This paper examines the role of elaboration as a mechanism to encourage less biased processing of personally relevant health appeals for consumers of caffeine (Study 1) and olestra (Study 2). Results of two studies demonstrate that high-relevance consumers defensively process by freezing on the threatening information, which leads to lower change appraisal (perceived severity, self-efficacy and response efficacy) and decreased message persuasion. For these individuals, renewed elaboration on the consequences of caffeine (Study 1) and olestra (Study 2) consumption can reduce defensive processing. This elaboration "unfreezes" message processing, which leads to greater change appraisal and increased message persuasion [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Session 09 : New work environment. The aim of {{this article}} is to look into the {{possible}} effects of an ageing workforce on occupational safety in the Netherlands, and to use this information to draw conclusions about effective age-related staff policy. The article analyzes data on occupational accidents in the Netherlands, demographic and personal variables and work-specific characteristics from the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey 2005 by means of multivariate regression analysis. The results show that the overall rate of accidents and the rate of occupational accidents resulting in absence drops as workers become older, while the rate of occupational accidents resulting in absence of at least a month increases slightly with age. The interaction effects identified show different effects of age on the risk of accidents in certain sub-groups. The age-related drop in the risk of occupational accidents does not apply to all workers or all sectors. As young workers are most <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> an occupational accident, an increase in the number of older workers will have a positive effect on the total number of occupational accidents in the Netherlands...|$|E

The analysis considers the implications for elderly individuals who choose to participate in the new Medicare Part D drug benefit, labelled the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernisation Act of 2003. The results highlight the necessity for the Medicare prescription drug benefit to carefully target the eldest among the elderly, who are most in need and are in danger of becoming trapped in the so-called Medicare 'doughnut hole', i. e. incur high prescription drug outlays, without adequate coverage.

40|$|Several {{foundational}} {{documents of}} bioethics mention the special obligation researchers have to vulnerable research participants. However, {{the treatment of}} vulnerability offered by these documents often relies on enumeration of vulnerable groups rather than {{an analysis of the}} features that make such groups vulnerable. Recent attempts in the scholarly literature to lend philosophical weight to the concept of vulnerability are offered by Luna and Hurst. Luna suggests that vulnerability is irreducibly contextual and that Institutional Review Boards (Research Ethics Committees) can only identify vulnerable participants by carefully examining the details of the proposed research. Hurst, in contrast, defines the vulnerable as those especially <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> the wrongs to which all research ethics participants are exposed. We offer a more substantive conception of vulnerability than Luna but one that gives rise to a different rubric of responsibilities from Hurst's. While we understand vulnerability to be an ontological condition of human existence, in the context of research ethics, we take the vulnerable to be research subjects who are especially prone to harm or exploitation. Our analysis rests on developing a typology of sources of vulnerability and showing how distinct sources generate distinct obligations {{on the part of the}} researcher. Our account emphasizes that the researcher's first obligation is not to make the research participant even more vulnerable than they already are.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The organist has an {{intensely}} physical {{relationship with her}} instrument. Over time, routines of practice and performance of music almost invariably lead to the build-up of stress, fatigue, and muscular tension that can lead in turn to pain and injury. The organist is particularly <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> tension and pain, due {{to the demands of}} negotiating performance on multiple dimensional planes (i. e., the multiple manuals at differing heights and the ranks of stops placed at some distance from the organist), with the added challenges of simultaneously operating the pedal board and additional expression pedals. Thus, all four limbs of the player are in almost constant and frequently independent motion, leaving the player susceptible to hyperextension, fatigue, and a variety of range-of-motion issues. The “Alexander Technique”, devised by F. M. Alexander in the 1890 s to assist performers and public speakers, can provide the organist with effective strategies for becoming more aware {{of the ways in which}} stress and tension can arise in the course of performance and how the prolonged misuse of the body leads to pain and injury. The goal of the Technique is restore physical balance, equilibrium and poise through body awareness, allowing efficient and painless movement over sustained periods of time. This dissertation investigates the ways in which the Alexander Technique can assist the organist in achieving this goal with regard to the particular physical demands and challenges of organ performance, focusing on how the Alexander Technique allows the organist to create and maintain the optimal posture for pain-free organ performance...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates {{one of the largest}} health care delivery systems in the nation [...] providing health care services to more than 5 million veterans each year in over 1, 000 facilities. These health care services are delivered by physicians, nurses, and other types of practitioners and range from routine examinations to complex surgical procedures. As in any health care setting, veterans receiving health care services at VA facilities may be <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> medical injury as a result of substandard care. Recent incidents have heightened concern about the quality of care provided to veterans by VA facilities. For example, in 2010 we reported that one VA facility discovered in 2009 that medical equipment had been improperly cleaned, thus posing safety risks to 2, 526 veterans. In the event that an injury occurs as a result of care rendered by a VA practitioner, a veteran alleging medical malpractice may seek compensation by filing a tort claim with one of VA's 22 regional counsel offices. The offices, which operate under VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC), are responsible for initially investigating and, to the extent possible, resolving the tort claims through administrative review. After undergoing administrative review, claims may proceed to litigation in federal court, in which the Department of Justice (DOJ) defends the United States. During either VA's administrative review or litigation, the government may resolve tort claims by making payments to veterans. When such payments are made to veterans, VA's Office of Medical-Legal Affairs (OMLA) uses medical information from these paid tort claims, as well as related medical records and other relevant information, to assess the quality of care provided to veterans. In 1995, we reported that data on tort claims provided opportunities for VA to identify concerns with individual providers and decrease the risk of future tort claims. Specifically, we recommended that VA use available data on tort claims to help identify problem-prone areas in VA's delivery of care and initiate programs that could help prevent the types of incidents that generate tort claims for medical injuries. VA generally concurred with our 1995 recommendation and implemented a process to analyze and use available tort claims data to assess the quality of veterans' care. In light of recent concerns about the quality of veterans' care provided in some VA facilities, Congress asked us to examine the resolution of tort claims filed against VA in the context of VA's efforts {{to improve the quality of}} veterans' care at its facilities. In this report, we (1) describe the number of tort claims that were resolved through VA's administrative review and through litigation from fiscal years 2005 through 2010 and (2) examine how OMLA uses paid tort claims data to assess the quality of veterans' care. ...|$|E

METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial at the cardiology outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Maastricht. Participants were <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> a cardiovascular event. Changes in risk behaviours and behavioural determinants were assessed with self-administered validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 1270 patients at baseline, 1169 after 4 months (92 %), and 1032 after 18 months (81. 3 %). After 4 months, intention-to-treat analyses revealed a decrease in fat consumption (- 5. 6 %, P = 0. 000), {{a reduction in the}} percentage of smokers [odds ratio (OR) 0. 57, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 33 - 0. 97] and a trend towards a maintained physical activity level (OR 1. 28, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 1. 70).

40|$|Individuals {{switch from}} risk seeking to risk aversion when mathematically {{identical}} options {{are described in}} terms of loss versus gains, as exemplified in the reflection and framing effects. Determining the neurobiology underlying such cognitive biases could inform our understanding of decision making in health and disease. Although reports vary, data using human subjects have implicated the amygdala in such biases. Animal models enable more detailed investigation of neurobiological mechanisms. We therefore tested whether basolateral amygdala (BLA) lesions would affect risk preference for gains or losses in rats. Choices in both paradigms were always between options of equal expected valueâ��a guaranteed outcome, or the 50 : 50 chance of double or nothing. In the loss-chasing task, most rats exhibited strong risk seeking preferences, gambling <b>at</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> double the penalty, regardless {{of the size of the}} guaranteed loss. In the betting task, the majority of animals were equivocal in their choice, irrespective of bet size; however, a wager-sensitive subgroup progressively shifted away from the uncertain option as the bet size increased, which is reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> aversion. BLA lesions increased preference for the smaller guaranteed loss in the loss-chasing task, without affecting choice on the betting task, which is indicative <b>of</b> reduced <b>risk</b> seeking for losses, but intact risk aversion for gains. These data support the hypothesis that the amygdala plays a more prominent role in choice biases related to losses.

During generalized seizures the individual is unable to utilize protective reflexes during falls and may consequently suffer head, orthopedic, or soft tissue injury. Our aim is to evaluate the spectrum of trauma in epilepsy patients presenting to our emergency department as a result of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient records collected between January 2004 and December 2007 at the Emergency Department of Dicle University Medical School. All patients aged 15 years or more with epilepsy and trauma due to generalized tonic clonic seizures were included in the study. Records were analyzed for age, gender, type of injury, sufficiency of anti-epileptic medication, and mortality. Results: The average age of the 51 patients included in the study was 26. 02 ± 9. 86 years, range 15 - 52 years. Thirty-three patients (64. 7 %) were male; the male female ratio was 1. 83. Soft tissue injuries were the most common injury (26 instances). Head trauma, cuts, dental and tongue injuries were less common. Blood levels of anti-epileptic medication were in the therapeutic range in 9 (17. 6 %) patients, while 42 (82. 4 %) had sub therapeutic levels for effective treatment.

The NCVS collects information at the household and person-level, and when victimization is identified through screener questions, at the incident-level. In addition to capturing crime and violence reported to the police and medical professionals, this methodology captures incidents that go unreported and untreated. Controlling for correlates of violence and reinjury, persons injured in violent events receiving medical attention alone, or in combination with police notification, are <b>at</b> substantially lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> future violence and violence-related injuries than persons injured but not receiving medical or police attention.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigates the}} {{economic}} consequences {{of illness and}} of paying for health care in Zimbabwe. It explores the incidence of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), impoverishment and the factors, (particularly socio-economic factors) associated with them. In addition, this study determines the strategies that households employ {{to cope with the}} financial burden of OOP payments in Zimbabwe. Data was collected from 499 households in Harare urban and Seke rural districts of Zimbabwe. Total monthly household OOP health expenditure was defined as 'catastrophic' if it exceeded the threshold level of 40 % of a household's monthly capacity to pay. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that influence the incidence of CHEs. A non-poor household was impoverished by OOP health expenditure if its total household expenditure after deducting OOP payments was lower than the subsistence expenditure. The results of this study indicated that, the incidence of CHEs was very high amongst the study population. Households at all levels <b>of</b> wealth <b>incurred</b> catastrophic health expenditures, and the proportion <b>of</b> households <b>incurring</b> CHEs was similar across the asset quintiles. Out-of-pocket payments precipitated impoverishment of non-poor households. Poor households, households with members above 65 years, female headed households, households with member(s) suffering from chronic illness and households with greater use of health services were <b>at</b> higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> CHEs. On the contrary, households with a disabled member were less likely to incur CHEs. Besides 'avoiding seeking care', selling of assets and borrowing were the 2 most popular strategies used to cope with OOP health care payments. An analysis of these results suggests that, targeted exemption of vulnerable households, as well as provision of subsidised health services could reduce the economic impact of illness on households. The results of this study also point out to the need for strengthening risk pooling mechanisms through the implementation of community based health insurance schemes and enhancing tax collection. In addition, other strategies that extend beyond the health sector such as economic empowerment of women could be effective in mitigating the economic impact of illness amongst female headed households in Zimbabwe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction As {{distance}} running {{continues to}} increase in popularity, so too does {{the number of people}} suffering from Running Related Injuries (RRI) (Abt et al. 2011). While identification of parameters related to RRI have commonly been identified in laboratory settings, ecologically sound testing methods are required in applied research. As inertial sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and combined units are low cost, portable and lightweight {{they may be able to}} generate the necessary information for applied research. While the use of inertial sensors in walking gait analysis has been widely documented, their application to longitudinal running gait analysis is extremely limited. Longitudinal Running Gait Analysis and Inertial Sensors – Why? An increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> RRI onset has long been identified with increasing absolute mileage ran per week (Walter et al. 1989). Yeung and Yeung (2001) found that in a review of the literature, increased exposure to higher training loads, whether it be running duration, frequency or distance, increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> RRI. It is therefore acceptable to reason that longitudinal studies would unveil a significant wealth of information related to RRI, compared to studies undertaking acute trials. Combined with this, parameters which can be derived from inertial sensor technology have been linked to RRI. Among the research, Zifchock et al. (2008) found that subjects with previous unilateral RRI presented elevated peak tibial acceleration on their previously injured side compared to their previously uninjured side. Meardon et al. (2011) found that through stride time long range correlations for previously injured subjects stride time variation differed from previously uninjured subjects. They also identified that this area should be investigated in the future in terms of injury prediction. Lastly, Mizrahi et al. (2000 a) identified decreases in stride rate due to fatigue in long distance running. These kinematic adaptions due to fatigue have been linked with RRI as they correspond with muscular fatigue causing a decreased ability to absorb shock and in increase in bone strain rate and magnitude (Mizrahi et al. 2000 b). Future Research and Conclusion Future research will focus on the use of inertial sensors, accelerometers in particular, on recreational runners training for and participating in a half/full marathon. These runners are <b>at</b> higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> an RRI due to their lack of previous running experience/mileage undertaken. Accelerometers will be placed bilaterally on the distal anteromedial tibia and record running sessions over 4 - 6 months in the training for and completion of the distance running event. If links between injury onset and acceleration patterns could be found within these individuals this would make significant progress towards combating injury onset and also the development of a feedback system to assist this...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} predictors of recurrent sprain after an index ankle sprain. Findings of our comprehensive systematic review of the literature demonstrated a scientific gap with regards to predictors of chronic ankle instability (CAI) after an index sprain. The second and third studies therefore, were designed to investigate what impairments after an index sprain predispose participants to recurrent sprains. Participants with a recent index sprain (n= 30) and controls (n= 70) were recruited. Ankle joint range of motion (ROM), balance, proprioception, motor planning, inversion/eversion peak power, and timed stair tests were measured and compared between two groups. Participants were then followed up for 12 months and occurrence of ankle sprains was recorded. Younger participants with an index sprain found to be <b>at</b> significantly higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>incurring</b> recurrent sprains. Although impaired balance was evident after an index sprain, balance deficits did not independently predict the likelihood of ankle sprain. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate the physical, physiological, functional and central differences among participants with CAI (n= 42), copers (participants who recovered from a sprain, n= 19) and controls (n= 21). Ankle joint laxity and ROM, balance, proprioception, motor planning, timed stair test, peak power, and cortical representation of the foot and ankle measured by limb laterality recognition task, were compared among the three groups. The groups did not demonstrate any significant differences across ranges variables measured. However, deficits in inversion/eversion, balance, and performance in limb laterality recognition task were associated with pain at the ankle joint. Further, proprioceptive deficits were present in participants regardless of a history of ankle sprain and were associated with centrally mediated changes shown by bilateral impairments in performance of limb laterality recognition task.
