5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> orbit and <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> encounter with another star.|$|E

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto <b>a</b> <b>distant</b> object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes {{modelled}} {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted.
