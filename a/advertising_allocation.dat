40|$|Abstract: Colonel Blotto {{games have}} been widely applied {{in a variety of}} {{contests}} where the players allocate resources across a number of battlefields and the winner in each battlefield is the one with more resources there. One drawback of this standard model is the assumption that players can perfectly target their efforts toward different battlefields. In many situations, players can only imperfectly target different battlefields, with an allocation affecting more than one battlefield. We develop an extension of Colonel Blotto that incorporates this type of interrelation. The equilibria here generally utilize mixed strategies that tend to be asymmetric across battlefields. That is, at least one player will have zero probability of dividing resources equally across battlefields, even if the characteristics of the battlefields are similar. We use advertising data from the 2002 races for governor and US senate to test the application of the Blotto model to political contests. Although the Colonel Blotto model has been used extensively to model political campaigns, we find that candidates’ <b>advertising</b> <b>allocations</b> across markets are far too symmetric to fit the model...|$|R

Scientific studies have focused on individual reactions to specific advertising forms in isolation and have offered little guidance for aggregate-level budget allocation decisions, which are typically based on simple rules. This article compares the long-term effectiveness of nine forms of advertising—seven online and two offline—by means of a structural vector autoregressive model and restricted impulse responses. For five product categories, we investigate how these forms of advertising generate traffic, affect conversion, and contribute to revenue. We find that content-integrated advertising is the most effective form, followed by content-separated advertising and firm-initiated advertising. Although online advertising forms have similar power to drive traffic, content integration dominates content separation in the area of progression toward purchase. Last-click attribution underestimates content-integrated activities and suggests online <b>advertising</b> budget <b>allocations</b> that yield 10 %– 12 % less revenue than the status quo, whereas the model's proposed online <b>advertising</b> budget <b>allocation</b> yields a 21 % revenue increase over the status quo.

40|$|Advertising is {{the major}} tool for {{transmitting}} information of products to consumers. In this study, we consider an <b>advertising</b> media <b>allocation</b> problem with the objective to maximize the firm's profit during the planning horizon. To obtain an optimal decision, an appropriate model that incorporates related variables is developed. The Lanchester model {{is the basis of}} the <b>advertising</b> media <b>allocation</b> decision model, for it is rich enough to provide a meaningful description of aggregate market profits. We focus on finite and equally-spaced discrete periods in this model. Since the <b>advertising</b> media <b>allocation</b> model is a non-linear programming model, a simulated annealing algorithm is employed to solve it. Other than presenting the procedure to solve the model with the simulated annealing algorithm, we explore the impacts on the objective function value of various values of the parameters. We also analyze the optimal <b>advertising</b> media <b>allocation</b> decisions against an even policy, advertising pulsing policy and advertising maintenance/pulsing policy implemented by the other major competitor respectively. 請參閱摘要(英) CONTENTS ABSTRACT……………………………………………i LIST OF TABLES …………………………………v LIST OF FIGURES…………………………………vi Chapter 1 Introduction………………………… 1 1. 1 Advertising Media Allocation……………… 1 1. 2 Research Objectives…………………………… 4 1. 3 Outline of The Thesis………………………… 6 Chapter 2 Literature Review……………………… 7 2. 1 The Lanchester model…………………………… 7 2. 1. 1 The Original Lanchester Model………………… 8 2. 1. 2 The Extended Lanchester Model…… 8 2. 2 Advertising Models………………… 10 2. 2. 1 Duopoly Models………… 10 2. 2. 2 Oligopoly Models…………………… 12 Chapter 3 Model Formulation………………………… 17 3. 1 The Notation and Assumptions…………………… 17 3. 2 The Media Allocation Model……………………… 19 Chapter 4 Simulated Annealing………………………… 22 4. 1 Introduction to Simulated Annealing…………… 22 4. 1. 1 The Analogy………………………………………… 23 4. 1. 2 The Application of Simulated Annealing……… 24 4. 2 The Algorithm of Simulated Annealing…………… 25 4. 2. 1 Local Search Strategies…………………………… 25 4. 2. 2 The Simulated Annealing Algorithm……………… 26 4. 3 Cooling Schedule………………………………………… 31 4. 3. 1 The Starting Temperature ………………………… 31 4. 3. 2 The Final Temperature ……………………………… 32 4. 3. 3 The Cooling Rateα…. …………………………… 33 4. 3. 4 Number of Iterations at Per Cycle IPC… 34 4. 3. 5 Stopping Criterion θ…………………………………………… 36 Chapter 5 Empirical Analyses…………………………… 38 5. 1 Sensitivity Analysis of the Parameters………… 38 5. 1. 1 Sensitivity Analysis of the Initial Market Share of Firm 1 … 41 5. 1. 2 Sensitivity Analysis of the Marginal Values of Firm 1 … 43 5. 2 Sensitivity Analysis of SA Parameters…………… 45 5. 2. 1 Sensitivity Analysis of the Cooling Rateα…………………… [...] . 45 5. 2. 2 Sensitivity Analysis of Different Values of the Starting Acceptance Probability ………………………… 46 5. 2. 3 Sensitivity Analysis of Different Combinations of theαand 47 5. 3 The Analysis of the Advertising Policies………… 49 5. 3. 1 Even Advertising Policy……………………………… 54 5. 3. 2 Advertising Pulsing Policy…………………………… 56 5. 3. 3 Advertising Pulsing/Maintenance Policy…………… 58 Chapter 6 Conclusions and Recommendation……………… 60 6. 1 Conclusions………………………………………………… 60 6. 2 Recommendation……………………………………………… 62 References………………………………………………………… 63 Appendix…………………………………………………………… 6...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{problems}} {{in two different}} application fields are investigated: {{the first one is}} the popular portfolio optimization problem and the second one is the newly developed online display advertising problem. The portfolio optimization problem has two main concerns: an appropriate statistical input data, which is improved with the use of factor model and, the inclusion of the transaction cost function into the original objective function. Two methods are applied to solve the optimization problem, namely,the conditional value at risk (CVaR) method and the reliability based (RB) method. Asset allocation problem in finance continues to be of practical interest because decisions as to where to invest must be made to maximize the total return and minimizing the risk of not attaining the target return. However, the commonly used Markowitz method, also known as the mean-variance approach, uses historic stock prices data and has been facing problems of parameter estimation and short sample errors. An alternative method that attempts to overcome this problem is the use of factor models. This thesis will explain this model in addition to explaining the basic portfolio optimization problem. Conditional value at risk and the reliability based optimization method are applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem with the consideration of transaction costs in the objective function. They are applied and evaluated by simulation in terms of their convergence, efficiency and results. The online display advertising problem extends a normal deterministic revenue optimization model to a stochastic allocation model. The incorporation of randomness makes it more realistic for the estimation of demand, supply and market price. Revenues are considered as a combination of gains from guaranteed contracts and unguaranteed spot market. The objective is not only to maximize the revenue but also to consider the quality of ads, so that the whole market obtains long-term benefits and stability. The thesis accomplishes in solving the online display <b>advertising</b> <b>allocation</b> problem in a stochastic case with the measure of conditional value at risk algorithm...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{covers a}} number of topics in public economics, specifically dealing with program evaluation and the private provision of public goods. The first chapter deals with the evaluation of a prominent federal policy: the Federal Healthy Marriage initiative. This program funded organizations at the community level, enabling the provision of relationship and marriage education {{in an effort to}} promote and sustain marriages. I identify the impact of funding on marriage and divorce, considering the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. I find that increased funding reduces the likelihood of marriage while also decreasing the likelihood of divorce amongst certain groups. In the second chapter, Randall Walsh and I evaluate a series of high-profile programs known as "Promise scholarships" in which private organizations guarantee money towards the costs of attendance at selected colleges and universities provided that a student has resided and attended school within a particular public school district continuously for at least the four years prior to graduation. Our estimates indicate that K- 12 public school enrollments increase in Promise zones relative to their surrounding areas following Promise announcements, schools associated with merit-based programs experience increases in white enrollment and decreases in non-white enrollment. Furthermore, housing prices increase following announcement, with the largest effects in neighborhoods with high quality schools in the upper half of the housing price distribution. These patterns lead us to conclude that such scholarships are primarily affecting the behavior of high-income households and that merit-based versions disproportionately impact white households. Finally, in the third chapter I examine the incentives for private firms, such as those sponsoring Promise scholarships, to participate in the production of public goods, specifically through sponsoring fundraising lotteries and raffles. I develop a model where firms have advertising incentives to contribute to public causes, deriving predictions about public goods production under various plausible <b>advertising</b> <b>allocation</b> mechanisms including exclusive sponsorships. I test these predictions in a laboratory experiment ultimately finding that, while exclusivity is sometimes beneficial in the theoretical environment, non-exclusive arrangements unambiguously generate more revenue for the public good empirically...|$|E

Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiring classification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns, such as targeted <b>advertising,</b> resource <b>allocation,</b> etc. To achieve this goal, we delegate part of the path extraction process to objects, by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppress unnecessary location updates and thus, help reducing communication overhead.

40|$|Much of the {{importance}} of the new dynamic programming methods has remained unnoticed because of the apparent complexity of the underlying mathematics. This is indeed unfortunate because the essence of the programming methods for certain classes of problems is not new to practicing economists. Dynamic programming methods can provide an efficient computational algorithm for problem types frequently encountered in consumer demand and production theory. In this paper the following approach will be utilized. First, an illustration concerned with the <b>allocation</b> of an <b>advertising</b> budget among competing media will be presented that will enable the reader to study the relationship between dynamic programming and simple combinatorial analysis. Second, an attempt will be made to show the relationship between demand and production theory on the one hand and programming on the other. Third, an <b>advertising</b> budget <b>allocation</b> problem much like the simpler one discussed in the first section will be cast in terms of the dynamic programming computational procedure and solved.

(2) To “map ” the P. A. Genome, just like the Human Genome has been mapped, to understand more fully the breadth and variety of public administration topics and behaviors. The analogy process starts with chromosomes. Each cell {{in the human body}} contains 23 pairs (male/female) of these. In the case of the P. A.

40|$|Models of {{advertising}} response implicitly {{assume that the}} entire advertising budget is spent on disseminating one message. In practice, managers use different themes {{of advertising}} (for example, price advertisements versus product advertisements) and within each theme they employ different versions of an advertisement. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly considers the effects of wearout {{as well as that}} of forgetting in the context of an advertising campaign that employs five different advertising themes. We quantify the differential wearout effects across the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better manage their scheduling. We develop a model to show how our response model parameters can be used to improve the effectiveness of <b>advertising</b> budget <b>allocation</b> across different themes. We find that a reallocation of resources across different themes according to our model results in a significant improvement in demand.

40|$|Copyright © The Authors 2007 Objective To {{identify}} key {{predictors of}} fast-food consumption {{from a range}} of demographic, attitudinal, personality and lifestyle variables. Methods We analysed data from a nationwide survey (n = 20 527) conducted in Australia by Nielsen Media Research. Items assessing frequency of fast-food consumption at (1) eat in and (2) take away were regressed onto 12 demographic, seven media consumption, and 23 psychological and lifestyle variables, the latter derived from factor analysis of responses to 107 attitudinal and behavioural items. Results Stepwise multiple regression analyses explained 29. 6 % of the variance for frequency of take-away and 9. 6 % of the variance for frequency of eat-in consumption of fast foods. Predictors of more frequent consumption of fast food at take away (and, to a lesser extent, eat in) included lower age – especially under 45 years, relative indifference to health consequences of behaviour, greater household income, more exposure to advertising, greater receptiveness to <b>advertising,</b> lesser <b>allocation</b> of time for eating, and greater allocation of time to home entertainment. There were no effects for occupational status or education level. Conclusions The effects for age suggest that fast-food take-away consumption is associated with a general cultural shift in eating practices; individual differences in attitudinal and lifestyle characteristics constitute additional, cumulative, predictive factors. The role of advertising and the reasons for the lesser explanatory value of the eat-in models are important targets for further research.

In this paper we review the econometric literature that examined the effects of marketing as well as recruiting effort on high quality enlistment contracts in the 1980 s. A random-effects meta analysis is used to examine the systematic variation across studies of advertising, recruiter effort, and unemployment rate elasticities. The result of a meta analysis indicates that (1) the estimated effect of unemployment rate on military recruiting does not vary significantly over several military recruiting studies; (2) the average elasticity of high quality contract with respect to unemployment rate is estimated as 0. 48; (3) elasticities of high quality contract with respect to advertising and recruiter forces are influenced by individual study characteristics; (4) although the Army recruiter elasticity (0. 43) turns out to be higher than advertising elasticity (0. 15), Army advertising appears to cost slightly less than recruiter forces on average when an additional contract is needed.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the sales of}} their products through advertising, firms must integrate their brand-advertising strategy for capturing market share from competitors and their generic-advertising strategy for increasing primary demand for the category. This paper examines whether, when, and how much brand advertising versus generic advertising should be done. Using differential game theory, optimal advertising decisions are obtained for a dynamic duopoly with symmetric or asymmetric competitors. We show how advertising depends on the cost and effectiveness of each type of advertising for each firm, the allocation of market expansion benefits, and the profit margins determined endogenously from price competition. We find that generic advertising is proportionally {{more important in the}} short term and that there are free-riding effects leading to suboptimal industry expenditure on generic advertising that worsen as firms become more symmetric. Due to free-riding by the weaker firm, its instantaneous profit and market share can actually be higher. The effectiveness of generic <b>advertising</b> and the <b>allocation</b> of its benefits, however, have little effect on the long-run market shares, which are determined by brand-advertising effectiveness. Extensions of the model show that market potential saturation leads to a decline in generic advertising over time. advertising, generic advertising, differential games, dynamic duopoly, optimal control...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by Internet <b>advertising</b> applications, online <b>allocation</b> {{problems}} have been studied extensively in various adversarial and stochastic models. While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the stochastic (such as i. i. d or random-order) arrival models do not realistically capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty {{is the presence of}} unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In this paper, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework. As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework...|$|R
40|$|While it is {{relatively}} easy to start an online <b>advertising</b> campaign, proper <b>allocation</b> of the marketing budget is far from trivial. A major challenge faced by the marketers attempting to optimize their campaigns is in the sheer number of variables involved, the many individual decisions they make in fixing or changing these variables, and the nontrivial short and long-term interplay among these variables and decisions. In this paper, we study interactions among individual advertising decisions using a Markov model of user behavior. We formulate the budget allocation task of an advertiser as a constrained optimal control problem for a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the theory of constrained MDPs, a simple LP algorithm yields the optimal solution. Our main result is that, under a reasonable assumption that online advertising has positive carryover effects on the propensity and the form of user interactions with the same advertiser in the future, there is a simple greedy algorithm for the budget allocation with the worst-case running time cubic in the number of model states (potential advertising keywords) and an efficient parallel implementation in a distributed computing framework like MapReduce. Using realworld anonymized datasets from sponsored search advertising campaigns of several advertisers, we evaluate performance of the proposed budget allocation algorithm, and show that the greedy algorithm performs well compared to the optimal LP solution on these datasets and that both show consistent 5 - 10 % improvement in the expected revenue against the optimal baseline algorithm ignoring carryover effects...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{customization}} and {{one-to-one marketing}} strategies have greatly impacted business {{practices in the}} last decade. This has been true in advertising where marketers can effectively customize a message based {{on the nature of}} the receiver, deliver it in a cost-effective way, and obtain feedback regarding its effectiveness. The purpose of the present study by the Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is to benchmark the amount of personalization and complexity of personalized advertising in the U. S. Two distinct populations, advertising agencies and marketing executives, were sampled to measure their current usage patterns and their underlying motivations for recommending personalization within the context of media planning and campaign execution. The objectives of the research were: 1. To define the dynamics between the advertising agency, the marketing executive, and the print services provider relative to media decisions and campaign direction. 2. To reveal the current preferences for print or non-print marketing programs and perspectives on the best media options for personalized campaigns. 3. To determine the amount of variable information or personalization used and the degree of complexity of the customized communication. 4. To understand the barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of a personalized communication strategy. 5. To determine who measures the effectiveness of a campaign and how it is done. The advertising agency respondents were drawn from The Red Book list, which contains detailed profiles of more than 13, 000 U. S. and international advertising agencies. A total of 250 advertising agencies completed a 30 - minute telephone interview in the spring of 2003. The marketing executive sample was drawn from the Dun and Bradstreet list and was restricted to financial services fi rms, manufacturers, and retail firms. A total of 1, 999 firms were contacted by phone to produce the 205 completed surveys. The results, by research objective, are: Dynamics Among Firms Impacting Media Choice • Over half (53 %) of marketing executives in the sample had used an advertising agency in the past year. Only 36 % reported that the advertising agency bought print on their behalf. • Approximately one-third of marketing executives printed almost all marketing materials internally. • Media choices for advertising revealed the integrated nature of campaigns. Magazines and newspapers led the way for both advertising agencies and marketing executives, making up 31 % and 35 % of their respective allocations. Collateral and direct mail made up a total of 23 % of <b>advertising</b> agencies’ media <b>allocations</b> and 31 % of marketing executives’ <b>allocations.</b> <b>Advertising</b> agencies spent a higher proportion of the media budget on broadcast television and radio than did the marketing executives. • The type of media purchased by advertising agencies varied according to their client base. Those that served primarily business-to-business (B 2 B) clients bought more collateral, direct marketing, and magazine advertising. Those that served primarily business-to- consumer (B 2 C) clients bought more broadcast TV, radio, and newspaper advertising. • Advertising agencies were asked to indicate up to five factors that drove the media choices for campaigns. Target market selection or demographic was the top factor at 71 %. Cost/budget was the second most important factor at 63 %; marketing strategy was third at 56 %. ROI target was important to 31 % of respondents. The least important specific factor driving media choices for campaigns was the need for a personalized message (14 %). Use of Personalization • An average of 23 % of the work completed by advertising agencies involved personalization. Nearly 20 % of advertising agencies had not produced a personalized campaign in the past year. An average of 33 % of marketing executives’ campaigns involved personalization. Only 3 % of the marketing executives had not produced a personalized campaign in the past year. • When asked, “To what degree are the messages customized?”, both advertising agencies and marketing executives responded that nearly half of their campaigns used the lowest level of complexity, the mail-merge option, including only a variable address and/ or salutation. Only 27 % of advertising agencies and 18 % of the marketing executives used graphics in the customized messages. • Over three quarters of advertising agency clients (79 %) who requested personalization were categorized as small, with annual revenues of $ 100 million or less. Nearly half of clients (47 %) who requested personalization were categorized as B 2 B companies. The two most common industry classifications for clients who requested personalization were manufacturing and retail, both at 40 %. The third most common industry classification for clients requesting personalization was financial at 34 %. • In response to the question of which types of media are best for personalization, 86 % of advertising agencies indicated that direct mail was the best. E-mail was rated as effective by 56 % and customized Internet pages were rated as effective by 35 %. Phone/call center/telemarketing was the lowest rated medium for personalization at 18 %. Barriers to Using Personalization • Nearly two thirds of both groups were aware of the new print technologies used for personalization. However, while over half of the advertising agencies said that they had shown samples to their corporate clients, only 36 % of the marketing executives reported that they had seen samples demonstrated by their agencies. • The biggest specific obstacles keeping advertising agencies from recommending personalization strategies to their clients were price and lack of a suitable database. For the marketing executives, the lack of resources (money, databases, people, or knowledge) and lack of need were the top obstacles mentioned. • The marketing executives were asked if they used a customer relationship management (CRM) system. Only 21 % indicated that they did. E x e c u t i v e Summary Copyright 2003 Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at RIT - All rights reserved. 4 However, almost all had a customer database. In managing the customer database, nearly 60 % used sales force management capabilities, 31 % used data mining, and 28 % used campaign management. Measuring Campaign Effectiveness • We found that advertising agency and marketing executive perceptions differed on this issue. Seventy-five percent of marketing executives said that they measured campaign results, whereas only 37 % of advertising agencies indicated that their clients, the marketing executives, measured the results. Sales leads, a change in sales, number of orders, and response to direct mail were used to measure results by 45 to 50 % of the marketing executives. In order for the demand for more complex levels of customized communications to grow, advertising agencies and their corporate clients must perceive the importance of personalization strategies in campaign planning. While there is still a need to build awareness, there is even greater need to communicate the cost/ benefi t advantages to customized communication. With reduced marketing budgets and intense ROI pressure, advertising agencies should find that their marketing executive clients are searching for proven techniques that will help them achieve better business results.

This growing interest is reflected in their allocated marketing budgets and expenditures, which shows that digital marketing and especially mobile <b>advertising</b> is booming. <b>Allocations</b> of the resources for various mobile advertising formats reveals that SMS (Short Message Service) advertising is usually ignored as it only accounts for a small portion of this expenditure, while newer approaches such as paid for search and display adverting incur the highest investments. However, new reports such as eMarketer (2016 a) suggest that there is still potential for SMS advertising to foster positive brand-customer relationships. These effects have been largely overlooked by both practitioners and academics as evidenced by the dearth of research on the influence of text messages on brand equity. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the effect of SMS advertising on online brand equity. There is a growing body of the literature recognising the importance of brand equity. However, in terms of online brands, there is still potential for further research on online brand equity and its corresponding dimensions. Subsequently, following a comprehensive review of the literature, this study adopts four dimensions –brand awareness, brand trust, brand value and brand loyalty – to investigate online brand equity. Thus, the present thesis explores the relationship between SMS advertising and dimensions of online brand equity. In particular, the research examines the effect of two factors – namely, attitude toward using SMS advertising and consumers’ incentives assessments – on adopted dimensions of CBBE (consumer based brand equity) for online brands; specifically, brand awareness, brand trust, brand value and brand loyalty. Furthermore, this study selects students in the UK as a new cultural context. Accordingly, this study developed four research objectives and fourteen hypotheses to achieve its aim. The positivist perspective was used to examine the hypotheses. Since the study was aimed at exploring relationships between known variables, a questionnaire was designed using key items form relevant studies and administered to 311 students in the UK. The collected data was analysed for validity and reliability and subsequently, the hypothesised relationships were examined using Smartpls 3. The findings of the research show that while there are statistically significant relationships between SMS advertising and dimensions of online brand equity, their overall effect on brand equity is limited – except for the influence of incentives assessments on brand loyalty. In particular, this study showed that attitude toward using SMS advertising has direct and significant relationships with both brand trust and brand awareness. Furthermore, consumers’ assessment of the incentives that are included in text messages could affect the brand value and brand loyalty. This research also demonstrates that there are inter-relationships between the identified dimensions of online brand equity i. e. there is a significant relationship between brand value and brand trust. Moreover, the findings show that consumers’ gains (benefits) from the text messages (i. e. incentives and information) have a more significant effect on consumers’ attitude toward using SMS advertising compared to the sacrifices demanded in the process (i. e. irritativeness and importance of permission). Thus, despite the fact that some limited studies have examined the effects of SMS advertising on brand equity, this research makes incremental contributions to the mobile advertising and branding research in three ways: First, the previous studies on the factors influencing consumers’ attitude toward SMS advertising were mainly conducted before 2010. However, the nature of SMS advertising has since changed significantly i. e. the role of text messages has changed from an entertaining communication medium to a simple informative and reminder of available offers. Hence, this research re-evaluates the strength of previously identified relationships in this regard. Furthermore – applying the expectancy-value theory— this thesis focuses on attitude toward using SMS advertising (attitude toward an act) in comparison to previous research which focused on attitude toward SMS advertising or attitude toward specific text messages (attitude toward an object). Secondly, based on the hierarchy of effects model, the present research examines the inter-relationships between the dimensions of online brand equity—namely, brand awareness, brand trust, brand value and brand loyalty—for pure digital brands. Thirdly, this thesis extends the hierarchy of effects model to determine the possible relationships between SMS advertising and the dimensions of online brand equity...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{landscape is}} littered with islands of disjoint resource providers including commercial Clouds, private Clouds, national Grids, institutional Grids, clusters, and data centers. These providers are independent and isolated {{due to a lack}} of communication and coordination, they are also often proprietary without standardised interfaces, protocols, or execution environments. The lack of standardisation and global transparency has the effect of binding consumers to individual providers. With the increasing ubiquity of computation providers there is an opportunity to create federated architectures that span both Grid and Cloud computing providers effectively creating a global computing infrastructure. In order to realise this vision, secure and scalable mechanisms to coordinate resource access are required. This thesis proposes a generic meta-scheduling architecture to facilitate federated resource allocation in which users can provision resources from a range of heterogeneous (service) providers. Efficient resource allocation is difficult in large scale distributed environments due to the inherent lack of centralised control. In a Grid model, local resource managers govern access to a pool of resources within a single administrative domain but have only a local view of the Grid and are unable to collaborate when allocating jobs. Meta-schedulers act at a higher level able to submit jobs to multiple resource managers, however they are most often deployed on a per-client basis and are therefore concerned with only their allocations, essentially competing against one another. In a federated environment the widespread adoption of utility computing models seen in commercial Cloud providers has re-motivated the need for economically aware meta-schedulers. Economies provide a way to represent the different goals and strategies that exist in a competitive distributed environment. The use of economic allocation principles effectively creates an open service market that provides efficient allocation and incentives for participation. The major contributions of this thesis are the architecture and prototype implementation of the DRIVE meta-scheduler. DRIVE is a Virtual Organisation (VO) based distributed economic metascheduler in which members of the VO collaboratively allocate services or resources. Providers joining the VO contribute obligation services to the VO. These contributed services are in effect membership “dues” and are used in the running of the VOs operations – for example <b>allocation,</b> <b>advertising,</b> and general management. DRIVE is independent from a particular class of provider (Service, Grid, or Cloud) or specific economic protocol. This independence enables allocation in federated environments composed of heterogeneous providers in vastly different scenarios. Protocol independence facilitates the use of arbitrary protocols based on specific requirements and infrastructural availability. For instance, within a single organisation where internal trust exists, users can achieve maximum allocation performance by choosing a simple economic protocol. In a global utility Grid no such trust exists. The same meta-scheduler architecture can be used with a secure protocol which ensures the allocation is carried out fairly in the absence of trust. DRIVE establishes contracts between participants as the result of allocation. A contract describes individual requirements and obligations of each party. A unique two stage contract negotiation protocol is used to minimise the effect of allocation latency. In addition due to the co-op nature of the architecture and the use of secure privacy preserving protocols, DRIVE can be deployed in a distributed environment without requiring large scale dedicated resources. This thesis presents several other contributions related to meta-scheduling and open service markets. To overcome the perceived performance limitations of economic systems four high utilisation strategies have been developed and evaluated. Each strategy is shown to improve occupancy, utilisation and profit using synthetic workloads based on a production Grid trace. The gRAVI service wrapping toolkit is presented to address the difficulty web enabling existing applications. The gRAVI toolkit has been extended for this thesis such that it creates economically aware (DRIVE-enabled) services that can be transparently traded in a DRIVE market without requiring developer input. The final contribution of this thesis is the definition and architecture of a Social Cloud – a dynamic Cloud computing infrastructure composed of virtualised resources contributed by members of a Social network. The Social Cloud prototype is based on DRIVE and highlights the ease in which dynamic DRIVE markets can be created and used in different domains...|$|R
