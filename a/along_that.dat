5|$|Highway130 has {{retained}} {{most of its}} current route since the mid-1970s, but was longer prior to then, when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then <b>along</b> <b>that</b> road into downtown Thunder Bay, ending at what is now Water Street.

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the route was {{improved}} west to Highway10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service roads were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate <b>along</b> <b>that</b> section.|$|E

The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BLI-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near {{the headquarters of the}} Whirlpool Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east <b>along</b> <b>that</b> roadway to an interchange with I-196/US31. The shoreline roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US31.

Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|From Quaking Aspen {{across the}} Sierra Nevada to Olancha, Caltrans {{has adopted a}} {{proposed}} alignment, but is unlikely to build it, {{in part due to}} two protected wilderness areas— the Golden Trout Wilderness and South Sierra Wilderness— along the route. The unconstructed routing heads northeast from Quaking Aspen, cresting a small summit before following Freeman Creek easterly past the Freeman Creek Grove, crossing the Kern River near its forks, and then using the path of Rattlesnake Creek and Beach Creek to the Beach Meadows area. Crossing several ridges to the northeast, SR 190 would make its way to the South Fork Kern River near Monache Mountain, then heading southeast <b>along</b> <b>that</b> waterway to the vicinity of Haiwee Pass. That pass, elevation about 8200 feet (2500 m) above sea level, would take the highway over the Sierra Crest into Inyo County, dropping down the steep Eastern Sierra escarpment for 12.0 miles (19.3km) in a north-northeasterly direction to US 395 at Olancha (elevation 3650 feet/1100 m).|$|E

In return, Archer tries to caution her that space exploration is not as idealistic as she thinks it is. In spite of this, the two manage to rekindle their romance. Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval. Elsewhere, Doctor Phlox learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack, xenophobically blaming all aliens, and Phlox's presence in a bar results in a brawl.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} a freeway along the US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic <b>along</b> <b>that</b> route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, {{which was to be}} maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E

From there, US16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit. <b>Along</b> <b>that</b> routing, it intersected US24 at Telegraph Road and M-39 at Southfield Road. US12 joined US16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road. The two ran {{the rest of the way}} concurrently to Cadillac Square.

5|$|Once again, Balize, Louisiana was {{directly}} in the hurricane's path, and suffered heavily as a consequence. The storm lasted from the afternoon on Friday, September 14 to late Saturday morning. Local reports indicate heavy rain and large hail fell {{in association with the}} cyclone, and in Balize, nearly every structure was destroyed; any buildings that withstood the initial winds were swept away by the ensuing inundation. Floodwaters killed ten people at one location alone in Plaquemines Parish. Residents of the hardest-hit communities were forced to wade to safety, in some cases through water shoulder-high. Northerly winds drove water from Lake Pontchartrain that had already been built up by northeasterly winds southward over small fishing and resort towns along the southern bank of the lake. Sheds, wharves, and bathhouses <b>along</b> <b>that</b> section of the lake were destroyed. Several people drowned in flood waters that covered lower Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane drove several ships, including the steamer Galveston, ashore.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner.

When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E
