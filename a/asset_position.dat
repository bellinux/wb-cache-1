40|$|The United States has a {{large and}} {{persistent}} current account deficit. Yet, U. S. 's income receipts {{from the rest of}} the world have exceeded its income payments to the rest of the world for many years. This appears to be paradoxical because for a country with a negative net foreign <b>assets</b> <b>position,</b> such as the U. S., international income payments to the rest of the world are likely to exceed its international income receipts. Hausmann and Sturzenegger (2005) offer an explanation of this apparent paradox. They argue that U. S. current account statistics do not properly measure U. S. 's net foreign <b>assets</b> <b>position</b> and that its actual net foreign <b>assets</b> <b>position</b> is measurably better than the officially estimated position primarily due to the existence of intangible corporate capital invested overseas. In their view the debate about the sustainability of the U.

This paper critically evaluates Hausmann et al's claims and examines the implications of their hypothesis.

50|$|Since 1989, {{the current}} account deficit of the US has been {{increasingly}} large, reaching close to 7% of the GDP in 2006. In 2011, it was the highest deficit in the world. New evidence, however, suggests that the U.S. current account deficits are being mitigated by positive valuation effects. That is, the U.S. assets overseas are gaining in value relative to the domestic assets held by foreign investors. The net foreign assets of the U.S. are therefore not deteriorating one to one with {{the current account}} deficits. The most recent experience has reversed this positive valuation effect, however, with the US net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>position</b> deteriorating by more than two trillion dollars in 2008, down to less than $18 trillion, but has since risen to $25 trillion. This temporary decline was due primarily to the relative under-performance of domestic ownership of foreign assets (largely foreign equities) compared to foreign ownership of domestic assets (largely US treasuries and bonds).|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of net outflows of long- and short-term capital and rising holdings {{of foreign exchange}} by the central government produced enormous change in Japan's accumulated holdings of foreign assets, compared with foreigners' holdings of assets in Japan. As a result, from a net <b>asset</b> <b>position</b> of US$11.5 billion in 1980 (meaning that Japanese investors held US$11.5 billion more in foreign assets than foreigners held in Japan), Japan's international net assets had grown to more than US$383 billion by 1991. Japanese assets abroad grew from nearly US$160 billion in 1980 to over US$2 trillion by 1991, a more than twelvefold increase. Liabilitiesâ€”investments by foreigners in Japanâ€”expanded somewhat more slowly, about elevenfold, from US$148 billion in 1980 to US$1.6 trillion in 1991. Dramatic shifts were seen in portfolio securities purchasesâ€”stocks and Bondsâ€”in both directions. Japanese purchases of foreign securities went from only US$4.2 billion in 1976 to over US$21 billion in 1980 and to US$632.1 billion by 1991.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} international monetary evolution {{over the past}} two decades is that gross international <b>asset</b> <b>positions</b> have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. The phenomenon is most evident for the high-income industrial countries, but even gross private foreign <b>asset</b> <b>positions</b> for emerging countries are on a generally rising trend. The best-known data on the phenomenon are those assembled by Philip Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, illustrated for a few countries in Chart 1. The chart shows the sum of gross foreign assets and liabilities divided by GDP. My thesis is that these ballooning gross positions, which of course reflect ballooning gross financial flows, have important implications for the functioning of the international monetary system. Some of these implications became painfully evident in the course of the global financial crises of 2007 - 10, but it has also become evident that economistsâ€™ knowledge of the determinants of gross financial flows and their repercussions is exceedingly slim. Relative to output, gross positions appear nonstationary based on the evidence to date, and most plausibly this is an artifact of rapid structural change. But we cannot predict with confidence when (or if) a stationary distribution of gross position ratios will emerge. Here is another area where mainstream macroeconomics has abstracted from real-world phenomena that are of first-order importance for economic stability and welfare. Falling political and technological barriers to international asset trade are of course consistent with the general trend, but we have few clues to explain <b>asset</b> <b>positions</b> that have quickly grown to multiples of GDP â€“ far beyond what simple homogeneous-agent models of international risk sharing woul...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEconomic {{reforms in}} rural China have brought {{opportunities}} to diversify both within-farm activities and off-farm activities. Participation in these activities {{plays an important}} role in increasing rural households' income. This paper analyzes the factors that drive rural households and individuals in their income-source diversification choices in a Northern China township. At the household level, we distinguish three types of diversification as opposed to grain production only: within farm (non-grain production) activities, local off-farm activities, and migration. We find that land availability stimulates on-farm diversification. Local off-farm activities are mostly driven by households' <b>assets</b> <b>position</b> and working resources, while migration decisions strongly depend on the household size and composition. At the individual level, we analyze the determinants of participation in three different types of jobs as compared to agricultural work: local off-farm employment, local self-employment and migration. We find a clear gender and age bias in access to off-farm activities that are mostly undertaken by male and by young people. The households' <b>assets</b> <b>position</b> as well as village networks are found to strongly affect participation in off-farm activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{cross-border}} portfolio holdings of a large variety of assets have risen sharply. This has created an important role for changes in asset prices of a country's external assets and liabilities (i. e. "valuation effects") in affecting the country's net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>position.</b> Valuation effects are commonly thought as stabilizing: they counteract current account movements and mitigate {{the impact of the}} current account on the country's net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>position.</b> This paper shows that whether valuation effects are stabilizing or not depends critically on the nature of underlying productivity shocks. In response to transitory shocks, valuation effects are stabilizing; but in response to trend shocks, such effects amplify the impact of the current account on the net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>position.</b> These contrasting results arise because optimally smoothing consumers respond differently to a transitory shock than to a trend shock to income. The results are consistent with the pattern of external imbalances between the United States and other G. 7 countries since the 1990 s.

40|$|The authors {{consider}} external sustainability {{from the}} perspective of equilibrium in net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>positions.</b> Under their approach, an external situation is sustainable if it is consistent with international and domestic investors'achieving their desired portfolio allocation across countries. They develop a reduced-form model of net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>positions</b> whose long-run equilibrium condition expresses the ratio of net foreign assets to the total wealth of domestic residents as a negative function of investment returns in the country relative {{to the rest of the}} world, a positive function of investment risk, and an inverse function of the ratio of foreign-owned to domestically owned wealth. To estimate this equilibrium condition, the authors use a newly constructed data set of foreign asset and liability stocks for a large group of industrial and developing countries, from the 1960 s to the present. They also develop summary measures of country returns and risks. Their econometric methodology is an application of the Pooled Mean Group estimator recently developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999), which allows for unrestricted cross-country heterogeneity in short-term dynamics while imposing a common long-run specification. The estimation results lend considerable support to the model, especially when applied to countries with low capital controls or high or upper-middle income. The results for countries with high capital controls and, especially, lower-income countries are less supportive of the stock equilibrium model. As a by-product of the model's estimation, the authors obtain estimates of the long-run equilibrium ratios of net foreign assets to wealth, conditional on the observed values of the country's relative returns, risks, and wealth. Then, for a selected group of industrial and developing countries, they evaluate the extent to which actual ratios diverge from their long-run counterparts - and hence the sustainability of current net foreign <b>asset</b> <b>positions.</b> Economic Theory&Research,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,International Terrorism&Counterterrorism,Fiscal&Monetary Policy,Environmental Economics&Policies,Environmental Economics&Policies,Banks&Banking Reform,Macroeconomic Management,Economic Theory&Research,International Terrorism&Counterterrorism...|$|R

The dataset provides a richer picture of financial linkages, enabling us to map the financing of Euro area imbalances. Creditor and debtor positions vis-ÃƒÂ -vis the rest of the EU have tended to increase between 2000 and 2008, with capital flowing largely from wealthier to catching-up economies.
