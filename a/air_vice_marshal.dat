5|$|Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF {{underwent}} major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control {{system to}} {{one based on}} function, resulting {{in the establishment of}} Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. At the same time, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne was absorbed by the Department of Air in Canberra. Hely was acting Air Member for Personnel from 3January to 7March 1955, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Val Hancock and Fred Scherger. On 24January 1956, he became AOC Training Command, taking over from <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Murdoch. He was succeeded as DCAS by <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Douglas Candy. Hely's rank of <b>air</b> <b>vice</b> <b>marshal</b> became substantive on 5September. In January 1957, Point Cook retired its last de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers, signalling the end of the biplane era in the RAAF. That May, Hely was seconded to the Department of Defence and posted to Washington,D.C., to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff. He was succeeded as AOC Training Command by <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Ian McLachlan.|$|E
5|$|On 30January 1961, Headlam {{joined the}} staff of Operational Command (OPCOM), the {{successor}} organisation to Home Command, responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units. He took over as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) OPCOM from <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Val Hancock in April. Headlam was promoted to <b>air</b> <b>vice</b> <b>marshal</b> on 29May. On 17July 1962, he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaya, and took up the appointment of AOC No.224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later. He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Alister Murdoch. As AOC No.224 Group, Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962, and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month. Divorced from his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20January 1964. He handed over No.224 Group to <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Christopher Foxley-Norris on 30November.|$|E
5|$|Headquartered in the Sydney {{suburb of}} Edgecliff, Eastern Area Command was formed on 15May 1942 under the {{leadership}} of <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Bill Anderson. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers. Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.2 (Training) Group. No.5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern Area Command. In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, formed the majority of his US flying units into the Fifth Air Force, and most of their Australian counterparts into RAAF Command, led by <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Bill Bostock. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the Chief of the Air Staff, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> George Jones, for supplies and equipment.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{had planned}} to deploy an {{airborne}} formation, No.238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre and requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command, but this was cancelled {{with the end of}} hostilities in August 1945. His next posting was to Kure, Japan, in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General John Northcott, commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin not only for his operational command and staff experience in the RAAF and the RAF during World WarII, but for his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having a background that was confined to the Air Force alone. Promoted acting <b>air</b> <b>vice</b> <b>marshal</b> on 1March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> John McCauley, in June 1947. After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) Frederick Scherger, in reshaping the post-war Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted <b>air</b> <b>vice</b> <b>marshal)</b> and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E

Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> George Jones, {{less than a year}} later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 General George Kenney, the {{commander}} of the Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), adopted a goal of landing forces at Selaru Island in the eastern NEI and establishing a bomber base there. Accordingly, in early March, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> William Bostock, who led RAAF Command, presented Kenney with a proposal for the RAAF to contribute two fighter wings and several ancillary units to this operation, which at the time was scheduled for 15June. One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and the other with Spitfires. In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell, the RAAF's highest-scoring flying ace of the war, reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> George Jones. In a meeting between Jones and Caldwell, Jones stated that the wing would have the highest priority for supplies and equipment.|$|E

The ADGB was reorganised on 13 July 1936, with control of fighter aircraft passing to the newly established RAF Fighter Command, which moved to RAF Bentley Priory. The following day the remaining elements of ADGB became RAF Bomber Command, headquartered in Hillingdon House.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. It {{soon became clear}} that Jones and Bostock could not get along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Northcott as Chief of the General Staff and Blamey as Commander-in-Chief bore some similarities {{to the one}} between the RAAF's Chief of the Air Staff, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> George Jones, and <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> William Bostock, {{the commander of the}} RAAF forces in the field, but Blamey was senior to Northcott, both in rank and in the Army's command structure. The relationship could still have been a delicate one, but in the event it was characterised by none of the rancour and rivalry that marred the wartime administration of the RAAF. In late 1943, Blamey sought to appoint Northcott as his deputy, but the government turned down his request, on the advice of General Douglas MacArthur, who did not want another officer who was answerable both to himself and the Australian Government. However, when Blamey travelled to Washington, D.C. and London in April 1944, he arranged for Northcott to act as Commander-in-Chief in his absence. After Wynter's death in February 1945, the post of LGA was abolished and the CGS again became responsible for administration.|$|E

The tests were supervised by Group Captain Snaith and observed by, amongst others, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals</b> Linnell and Burton.Following its successful first flight, undertaken by Captain Baker, the next series of test flights revealed the MB3 to be highly manoeuvrable and easy to fly but on 12 September 1942, the engine failed soon after take-off and Captain Baker, {{in an attempt to}} save the aircraft while executing a difficult forced landing, crashed in a field and was killed.|$|R
500|$|As AMP, Hewitt was {{responsible}} for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post-war Air Force. This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal Richard Williams and <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals</b> Stanley Goble, Bill Bostock, Frank McNamara, Bill Anderson, Henry Wrigley and Adrian Cole, ostensibly {{to make way for}} the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees, explaining the reasons for the decision and redundancy payments involved. He also had the [...] "thankless task" [...] of rationalising the Air Force List of officers and their seniority, which had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime. This resulted in many officers of senior rank being 'demoted' as many as three levels, such as group captain to flight lieutenant, in the first post-war List released in June 1947.|$|R
500|$|Bostock's {{relationship}} to Kenney permitted him to ignore operational requests from Jones, while Jones continued to assert administrative control over Bostock's command. When Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command in April 1943 and replace him with Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, AOC of No.9 Operational Group, Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones {{that he was}} opposed to any such change of command. Kenney threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government, and some time later MacArthur told Curtin that Hewitt [...] "was not an adequate replacement" [...] for Bostock. The matter was allowed to drop, but the rivalry continued. In January 1945, an acrimonious series of cables was exchanged between the two <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals.</b> Jones complained to Bostock of the latter's [...] "insubordinate tone" [...] and [...] "repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters". Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was [...] "responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you", {{and that he would}} [...] "continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference".|$|R
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> Adrian Lindley Trevor Cole, CBE, DSO, MC, DFC (19June 1895– 14February 1966) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Joining the army at the outbreak of World WarI, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1916 and flew with No.1 Squadron in the Middle East and No.2 Squadron on the Western Front. He became an ace, credited with victories over ten enemy aircraft, and earned the Military Cross and the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1921, he was {{a founding member of}} the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 10 June a group of senior officers, including General Douglas MacArthur, his air commander General George Kenney, and Australians Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead and <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshal</b> William Bostock (head of RAAF Command), made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead. MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in action, and the party visited a group of front line infantrymen before departing.

500|$|For his {{commitment}} to the concept of airworthiness, as an attitude to quality and professionalism that went beyond simply whether aircraft were fit to fly or not, Wackett has been described as one of the [...] "outstanding officers of the post-war era". [...] The establishment of a dedicated Technical Branch, which he founded in 1948, was a key factor in the Air Force developing the ability to successfully manage the maintenance and upgrade of such highly sophisticated aircraft as the General Dynamics F-111. Wackett's 17-year tenure on the Air Board, which was dissolved in 1976, remained the longest of any officer in the RAAF. He was followed by a series of leaders of the Technical Branch (renamed Engineering Branch in 1966) who shared his vision, including <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals</b> Ernie Hey (1960–1972) and James Rowland (1972–75). Wackett was among those considered as possible successors to Air Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) when the latter was retired in 1952, but Prime Minister Robert Menzies' federal government chose an RAF officer for the role, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman. In any case, Air Force regulations at that time stipulated that appointees had to belong to the RAAF's General Duties (Aircrew) Branch. In 1975, Air Marshal Rowland was appointed as CAS, though he had to transfer from Engineering to General Duties before this could be formalised. The following year, the requirement for CAS {{to be a member of}} the General Duties Branch was removed.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{independence}} of Pakistan and the migration of nearly all Sikhs to India the Sikh community's rights were diminished as their population decreased.

For example, Hercharn Singh became the first Sikh to join the Pakistan Army. For {{the first time in}} the 58-year history of Pakistan there has a Sikh been selected into Pakistan's army. Prior to Harcharan Singh's selection in the Pakistani army no individual person who was a member of the Hindu or the Sikh community were ever enrolled in the army, however; the Pakistani Christian community has prominently served in the Pakistan Armed Forces and some had even reached into to the ranks of Major Generals in the army, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals</b> in the Pakistan Air force and rear Admiral in the Pakistan Navy.

He {{travelled}} via the United States, meeting film stars Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour {{on the set}} of Road to Utopia at Los Angeles in February 1944. In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the invasion of France on 6June 1944, he wrote: [...] "There has been no rejoicing. A hushed quietness has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it." [...] Later in the year, Lerew was invested with his Distinguished Flying Cross by King GeorgeVI at Buckingham Palace. He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a Royal Air Force night-fighter pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced. In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General George Vasey; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew. Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director. Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the notorious feud between the service's two senior officers, <b>Air</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Marshals</b> George Jones and Bill Bostock, Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.|$|R
