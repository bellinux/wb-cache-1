Human population growth and associated demand for land, food and resources is the key impact on wilderness.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{reforms of the}} regulatory business environment inspired by the World Bank’s Doing Business reports impact the economic participation of women in developing countries. It focuses on gender-related impacts of four business environment reforms in areas of 1) Obtaining Credit, 2) Registering Property, 3) Starting a Business and 4) Employing Workers. The paper begins by describing the methodology of the Doing Business reports and how the suggested reforms would lead to private sector growth. Then, using an institutional economics framework, it traces women’s most binding constraints in areas of credit, land titling, business start-up and female employment that the Doing Business failed to capture. Discussions show how Doing Business-style reforms in the four areas mentioned create ambiguous impacts for women entrepreneurs by either leading to increased economic opportunities or reinforcing constraints and opening up <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploitation.</b> The paper emphasises that {{although most of the}} binding constraints for female economic participation take root at the level of customs, norms and beliefs – it is possible for the government to remove discrimination in the private sector by creating informed, gender-sensitive reforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the {{relation}} between national economic ventures, environmental security and community development. It does so through {{a case study of}} the implementation process of an iron and copper mine (La Dominga Project) in a “biodiversity hotspot” in central-northern Chile. Using qualitative methods to gather empirical data and a discursive analytical framework, it seeks to understand how the mine affects livelihoods and community development, as perceived by local citizens. The results show that the state, the extractive industries and private landowners constantly contest the local community’s access to land. The state and the industry have an advantage in power, manifested in the decision-making procedure. As a consequence of the deficient participation in this process, the community faces a forced exposure to risk. La Dominga jeopardizes local livelihoods and alternative development plans, which show potential to be long-term ecologically sustainable. Those are 1) the community based- and adaptively co-managed <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploitation</b> of benthic resources and 2) the tourist activities, based on the bird and whale spotting tours to the closely located protected islands. The thesis further suggests that social mobilization and articulation of local resistance fails because of 1) elements of social control within the community, 2) the discursive role of mining, and more specifically copper mining in the Chilean landscape ideologies and 3) CSR-interventions in form of extensive, individual “grant programs”...|$|E

Archaeological evidence at today's Normanton points to Haw Hill (or How Hill), an eminence that was probably a Norman defensive strategic mound once reinforced by a wooden palisade. The evidence of a Norman motte-and-bailey fortification at the town, and the name, is likely evidence that Normanton's name derived from the substantial Anglo-Norman presence in the area.

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) use {{unusual and}} restricted habitats such as swampy clearings, montane outcrops and dry rivers {{for a variety}} of social and ecological reasons. Within these habitats elephants focus on very specific <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> resource <b>exploitation,</b> resulting in deep caves, large forest clearings and sand pits as well as long-established and highly demarcated routes for moving between resources. We review evidence <b>for</b> specific habitat <b>exploitation</b> in elephants and suggest that this represents socially learned cultural behaviour. Although elephants show high fidelity to precise locations over the very long term, these location preferences are explained neither by resource quality nor by accessibility. Acquiring techniques for exploiting specific resource sites requires observing conspecifics and practice, and is evidence for social learning. Elephants possess sophisticated cognitive capacities used to track relationships and resources over their long lifespans and they have an extended period of juvenile dependency {{as a result of the}} need to acquire this considerable social and ecological knowledge. Thus, elephant fidelity to particular sites results in traditional behaviour over generations, with the potential to weaken relationships between resource quality and site preferences. Illustrating the evidence for such powerful traditions in a species such as elephants contributes to understanding animal cognition in natural contexts...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of industrialization and urbanization in China, arable land resources are still continuing to be occupied, {{leading to the}} intensification of conflicts between an increasing population and decreasing arable land resources. Thus, how to exploit and use the reserve resources of arable land in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has attracted much more attention under the serious situation of protecting arable land. But it is the necessary prerequisite {{to carry out a}} study on natural suitability evaluation before the exploitation and utilization of reserved arable land. This paper took the reserved arable land of 18 counties in the "Three Rivers" Area region of Tibet as an example. Eight factors of landform, climate, soil and water, that is, slope, elevation, slope direction, temperature, rainfall, soil depth, organic matter content, and distance to water area, were adopted as evaluation factors. The fuzzy weight of evidence model, which is both knowledge and data driven, was employed to get the grade of natural suitability evaluation of reserve resources of arable land, which was then compared with the result evaluated by a comprehensive index model. Evaluation results showed as follows: first, 99. 38 % of "reference objects" of the arable land are above the third grade on the basis of five suitability grades in total, which means that the fuzzy weight of evidence model could evaluate the natural suitability of reserved arable land effectively. Second, compared with the evaluation results of a comprehensive index model, 90. 83 % of the arable land resources are above the third grade, which shows the fuzzy weight of evidence model is more objective and reasonable than the comprehensive index model in this case. And it also overcomes the subjective arbitrariness in weight determination and the computation complexity by various natural conditions. Third, 11 434. 1 km 2 of reserved arable land had suitable natural quality, among which grade 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accounted for 9. 6 %, 5. 5 %, 38. 6 %, 22. 8 %, and 23. 4 % respectively. And we suggest that Shigatse, Konggar, Chanang, Lhaze, Nedong, Lhasa, and Bainang counties should be the main <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> <b>exploitation</b> of reserved arable land in the future...|$|R

The Huaibei coalfield is typically composed of various tectonically deformed coals containing rich coalbed methane resources. However, the occurrence of coal seam {{in this area is}} complicated largely by the structural deformation, which has not yet been evaluated systematically <b>for</b> exploration and <b>exploitation</b> of coalbed methane. In this study, tectonism in Huaibei coalfield is discussed by combining systematic analyses on the occurrence of coal seams and the formation of coalbed methane reservoirs. The study shows that, with structural deformation in the study area, the coal seams in Huaibei coalfield are distributed in north-south tectonic blocks and east-west tectonic zones. North tectonic block of Huaibei coalfield is not favourable <b>for</b> <b>exploitation</b> of coalbed methane because of low gas content or disadvantageous structural conditions. Within the south tectonic block, the east Suzhou syncline contains high gas content but coal permeability is very low. This area is generally not suitable <b>for</b> <b>exploitation</b> of coalbed methane and is a dangerous mining area due to gas outburst because of the widely developed mylonitic coals. South Suzhou and Nanping synclines in the middle part of the south tectonic block are exposed to relatively weak structural deformations.

40|$|From {{mechanics}} and macroscopic viewpoints, {{the sensitivity of}} the flow stress of a material to the strain rate, i. e. the strain rate sensitivity (m), governs the development of neck formation and therefore has a strong influence on the tensile ductility and hence formability of materials. Values of strain rate sensitivity range from unity, for the case of Newtonian viscous materials, to less than 0. 1 for some dispersion strengthened alloys. Intermediate values of m = 0. 5 are associated with classical superplastic materials which contain very fine grain sizes following specialized processing. An overview is given of the influence of strain rate sensitivity on tensile ductility and of the various materials groups that can exhibit high values of strain rate sensitivity. Recent examples of enhanced formability (or extended tensile ductility) in specific regimes between m = 1 and m = 0. 3 are described, and potential <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> commercial <b>exploitation</b> are noted. These examples include: internal stress superplasticity, superplastic ceramics, superplastic intermetallics, superplastic laminated composites, superplastic behavior over six orders of magnitude of strain rate in a range of aluminum-based alloys and composites, and enhanced ductility in Al-Mg alloys that require no special processing for microstructural development...|$|R

The objective was to delineate the aquifer system and to assess its exploitation potential. The investigation comprised time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) soundings, tectonic interpretations of satellite images as well as a drilling program with borehole geophysics and water sampling, followed by a water analysis. A total of 77 TEM soundings were carried out in two field campaigns. The soundings were highly successful to delineate the before unknown extent of the Eiseb Graben, and the resistivity distribution accurately displays its internal structure. A promising <b>area</b> <b>for</b> groundwater <b>exploitation</b> was located at the northern graben flank, possibly bound to a paleo-channel filled with relatively coarse sediments.

Pope John Paul II maintained that the stark Cartesian opposition between body and spirit leads to human sexuality as an <b>area</b> <b>for</b> manipulation and <b>exploitation,</b> rather than wonder and unity as he addresses in the Theology of the Body lectures.|$|R
40|$|In Chile, a Territorial User Rights for Fisheries {{system was}} {{developed}} to manage benthic fisheries. This system {{is referred to as}} Management <b>Areas</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Exploitation</b> of Benthic Resources. Management areas involved a shift from top-down control by governments to comanagement. We have analyzed the effects of a highly variable fishery, characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, on the governance of local institutions designed for resource management. We focused on a case study in north central Chile, in which the surf clam fishery experienced high levels of variability when the fishery was in an open access system. The management <b>areas</b> were established <b>for</b> the fishery in 1999. As a result, a set of rules for the fishery were created and enforced by fishers and local fishery authorities. Despite intense efforts on the part of all stakeholders, the fishery collapsed after three years of management area policy. This approach {{has been shown to be}} an effective management option for other species; however, for resources with boom-and-bust cycles, it is important to understand the response pattern of users confronting this spatial and temporal variability before the establishment of territorial user rights. Defining the appropriate spatial scale of the territorial rights could allow fishers to switch among different surf clam beds to maintain their livelihood and support the sustainability of local institutions for resource management...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the possibilities of touristic development of the La Lopé National Park and to indicate the most important barriers and limitations of the <b>area</b> <b>exploitation.</b> <b>For</b> this purpose a SWOT method was applied. This assignment presents the situation as of the end of 2014. The majority of the up-to-date data was collected during the mission, the purpose of which was to observe the region, and which was organized by Université Omar Bongo in Libreville and Warsaw University. The La Lopé National Park has a significant touristic potential which is very poorly used. The diagnose of the reasons for that can be an indicator for attempts to rationally use the resources of the region and present an appropriate development strategy...|$|R
40|$|We used {{allozyme}} electrophoresis {{to compare}} the genetic variation of an introduced and strongly isolated population of the edible clam Tapes decussatus in the Azores (Lagoa de Santo Cristo, Sao Jorge) with populations from the main range of the species (Ria and Thau). Observed and expected heterozygosity values, number of polymorphic loci, and mean number of alleles per locus in the main-range populations fall within the limits reported for T. decussatus and other Venerid clams. In contrast to previous studies on Venerid clams, we observed no heterozygote deficiencies. In the introduced Lagoa population, we observed a strong reduction of allelic diversity and expected heterozygosities and an effective population size of only 5. 30. The Lagoa population is only slightly differentiated from populations from the species' main range and may thus be of low "biological value. " Exploitation of T. decussatus could therefore {{be allowed to continue}} but must follow strict collection guidelines, especially given that only 15 % of the <b>area</b> is suitable <b>for</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Otherwise, a unique component of the Azorean fauna that also serves as a fishery resource may be lost...|$|R
