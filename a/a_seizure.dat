5|$|After {{the active}} portion of <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} {{a period of}} recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> is relatively common, occurring in 6â€“10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss in the event of <b>a</b> <b>seizure.</b> As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of epilepsy is unknown, {{but a little}} is known about its cellular and network mechanisms. However, it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> with its excessive synchronization.|$|E
50|$|Myoclonic astatic <b>Seizures</b> {{that involve}} <b>a</b> myoclonic <b>seizure</b> {{followed}} immediately by <b>an</b> atonic <b>seizure.</b> This type of seizure is exclusive to MAE {{and is one}} of the defining characteristics of this syndrome.|$|R
50|$|When {{the effects}} of <b>a</b> partial <b>seizure</b> appear as <b>a</b> 'warning sign' before <b>a</b> larger <b>seizure,</b> they are known as an aura: frequently, <b>a</b> partial <b>seizure</b> will spread {{to other parts of}} the brain and {{eventually}} become generalized, resulting in a tonic-clonic convulsion. The subjective experience of an aura, like other partial seizures, will tend to reflect the function of the affected part of the brain.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that anticonvulsant therapy {{should be offered}} once a patient has experienced 2 or more seizures. However, there is controversy over whether treatment should be offered after <b>a</b> single <b>seizure.</b> The type of epileptic event that has occurred may {{determine whether or not}} a single episode will bring the individual to medical attention. In individuals who experience <b>a</b> single <b>seizure,</b> there is significantly increased risk of recurrence if neurological or paroxysmal electroencephalogram abnormalities are present or if the seizure is partial. Anticonvulsant therapy, if taken as prescribed after <b>a</b> single <b>seizure,</b> will substantially reduce the risk of <b>seizure</b> recurrence. Unless <b>a</b> further <b>seizure</b> would hold little disadvantage, early treatment probably offers distinctly more benefit than hazard. No data are available to indicate the most appropriate duration of therapy after <b>a</b> single <b>seizure...</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of his}} life, Kennedy {{had come to be}} viewed as a major figure and {{spokesman}} for American progressivism. In 2008, Kennedy was hospitalized after suffering <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> and was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died at age 77 on August 25, 2009, at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is defined}} as a severe P.falciparum-malaria {{presenting}} with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale greater than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after <b>a</b> <b>seizure.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the luncheon, Senator Ted Kennedy {{collapsed}} {{after suffering}} <b>a</b> <b>seizure,</b> {{and he was}} transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, {{a longtime friend of}} Kennedy, eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{breakthrough}} <b>seizure</b> is <b>an</b> epileptic <b>seizure</b> {{that occurs}} despite {{the use of}} anticonvulsants that have otherwise successfully prevented seizures in the patient. Breakthrough seizures may be more dangerous than non-breakthrough seizures because they are unexpected by the patient, who may have considered themselves free from seizures and therefore, not take any precautions. Breakthrough seizures are more likely {{with a number of}} triggers. Often when <b>a</b> breakthrough <b>seizure</b> occurs in <b>a</b> person whose <b>seizures</b> have always been well controlled, there is a new underlying cause to the seizure. Rates of breakthrough seizures vary. Studies have shown the rates of breakthrough seizures ranging from 11-37%. The treatment for <b>a</b> breakthrough <b>seizure</b> involves measuring the level of the anticonvulsant in the patient's system, and may include increasing the dosage of the existing medication, adding another medication in addition to the existing one, or altogether switching medications. A person with <b>a</b> breakthrough <b>seizure</b> may require hospitalization {{for a period of time}} for observation.|$|R
50|$|In simple focal <b>seizures</b> <b>a</b> {{small part}} of one of the lobes may be {{affected}} and the person remains conscious. This will often be a precursor to <b>a</b> larger <b>seizure</b> such as <b>a</b> complex partial <b>seizure.</b> When this is the case, the simple partial seizure is usually called an aura.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> complex focal <b>seizure</b> is <b>an</b> epileptic <b>seizure</b> that is {{associated}} with unilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and causes impairment of awareness or responsiveness, i.e. alteration of consciousness.|$|R
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) {{journey to}} the Greene home. There, Glenn begins to pray for the {{well-being}} of his fellow survivors, while T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. Meanwhile Carl goes in and out of consciousness, and briefly recalls his encounter with the deer before going into <b>a</b> <b>seizure.</b> A distraught Lori opines to Rick about ending Carl's suffering, but Rick insists on keeping him alive.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2008, Kennedy {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>seizure,</b> {{and then}} another one as he was rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced that Kennedy had a malignant glioma, a type of cancerous brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought reactions of shock and prayer from many senators of both parties and from President Bush.|$|E
5|$|Slowly {{stopping}} medications may {{be reasonable}} {{in some people}} who do not have <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months. Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults.|$|E
50|$|If <b>a</b> focal <b>seizure</b> spreads {{from one}} {{hemisphere}} {{to the other}} side of the brain, this will give rise to <b>a</b> secondarily generalised <b>seizure.</b> The person will become unconscious and may well have <b>a</b> tonic clonic <b>seizure.</b> When people have multiple focal seizures they generally have a condition known as temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|R
50|$|Epilepsy surgery {{investigations}} are performed to identify <b>a</b> discrete <b>seizure</b> focus. Extensive investigations in ring chromosome 20 syndrome patients fails to identify <b>a</b> discrete <b>seizure</b> focus and published data supports that that epilepsy in ring chromosome 20 syndrome is not amenable to resective surgery.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> complex focal <b>seizure</b> affects <b>a</b> larger {{part of the}} {{hemisphere}} than <b>a</b> simple partial <b>seizure</b> and the person may lose consciousness.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about <b>a</b> <b>seizure.</b> Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|While {{being treated}} for various injuries, Favre {{developed}} an addiction to Vicodin, which became publicly known when he suffered <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> during a hospital visit. Amid an NFL investigation, he went public to avoid any rumors about his condition. In May 1996, he went into treatment and remained in rehabilitation for 46 days. Had he chosen not to go, the NFL would have imposed a $900,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E

50|$|In <b>a</b> complex partial <b>seizure</b> <b>a</b> {{person may}} appear {{confused}} or dazed {{and can not}} respond to questions or direction. Focal seizure may become generalized.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>seizure</b> {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after <b>a</b> <b>seizure.</b> It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of generalized seizures are idiopathic. However, some generalized <b>seizures</b> start as <b>a</b> smaller <b>seizure</b> such as <b>a</b> simple partial <b>seizure</b> or <b>a</b> complex partial <b>seizure</b> and then spread to both hemispheres of the brain. This is called a secondary generalization. Factors could include chemical and neurotransmitter imbalances and <b>a</b> genetically determined <b>seizure</b> threshold, {{both of which have}} been implicated. The seizure threshold can be altered by fatigue, malnutrition, lack of sleep or rest, hypertension, stress, diabetes, the presence of neon or xenon strobe-flashes, fluorescent lighting, rapid motion or flight,blood sugar imbalances, anxiety, antihistamines and other factors.|$|R

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300â€“400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450â€“600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct <b>a</b> <b>seizure</b> and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing oneâ€™s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E
