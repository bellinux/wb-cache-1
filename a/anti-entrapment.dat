She worked for <b>anti-entrapment</b> laws {{and the right to}} privacy. She was involved in the founding and work of the present Mattachine Society as well as its predecessor and focused on the Chicago Police Department and its historic entrapment of gays.|$|E
50|$|According to the National Safety Council (NSC), 172 {{children}} under the age of 15 drowned in pools or spas between Memorial Day and Labor Day in 2010. An additional 180 {{children under}} the age of 15 were injured. The NSC is further calling for increased vigilance by parents and pool/spa owners. They suggest precautions such as four sided fences for pool/spa areas, alarms on all doors accessing pool/spa areas, heavy duty pool covers, <b>anti-entrapment</b> drains and close supervision of children near pools/spas.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2002, Graeme {{was stuck}} to {{a hot tub}} drain by suction. Efforts by her mother to free her were {{unsuccessful}} and when two men eventually were able to free her (postmortem), the drain broke from the force. Although Graeme drowned, her official {{cause of death was}} [...] "suction entrapment due to a faulty drain cover". Following Graeme's death in June 2002, her mother, Nancy Baker, began work to advocate pool and spa safety. She began lobbying Congress to pass legislation to require <b>anti-entrapment</b> drain covers as well as other pool and spa safety devices. Sponsored by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act was included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 as Title XIV. [...] EISA was introduced to Congress on January 12, 2007 and signed into law on December 19, 2007 by President George W. Bush.|$|E
40|$|Can {{regulated}} parties ever rely {{on official}} assurances {{that the law}} will not apply to them? Recent marijuana and immigration nonenforcement policies have presented this question in acute form. Both policies effectively invited large numbers of legally unsophisticated people to undertake significant legal risks in reliance on formally nonbinding governmental assurances. The same question also arises {{across a range of}} civil, criminal, and administrative contexts, and it seems likely to recur in the future so long as partisan polarization and sharp disagreement over the merits of existing law persist. This Article addresses when, if ever, constitutional due process principles may protect reliance on federal officials’ nonenforcement assurances. The Article proposes that answering this question ultimately requires balancing separation of powers costs against fairness considerations. As a general matter, the balance tilts in favor of preserving the enforceability of substantive prohibitions, so as to deny executive officials de facto authority to cancel statutes by inviting reliance on promised nonenforcement. In certain circumstances, however, particularly acute fairness concerns or limited separation of powers costs support recognizing a reliance defense. Courts have already recognized a limited <b>anti-entrapment</b> due process defense in some cases in which enforcement officials mistakenly assure regulated parties that planned conduct is lawful. This Article proposes that an analogous reliance defense should bar use of information obtained in reliance on promised nonenforcement, including information provided to the government in connection with recent immigration programs; that other forms of indirect reliance, such as providing facilities or services to formally illegal businesses, should receive protection; that courts should sometimes protect individuals’ reliance on congressionally mandated (rather than agency-initiated) nonenforcement; and that longstanding persistence of overt nonenforcement policies should eventually support a due process defense of desuetude. The Article also suggests that Presidents and Congresses in the future might seek to avoid risks of unfairness created by nonenforcement policies by relying instead on executive clemency, administrative measures, and legislative reforms to moderate the scope of outdated or unpopular laws...|$|E
