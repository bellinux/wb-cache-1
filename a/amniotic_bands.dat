50|$|Bands which {{wrap around}} {{fingers and toes}} can result in {{syndactyly}} or amputations of the digits. In other instances, bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet. In more severe cases, the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>bands</b> can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate. If the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be life-threatening for the fetus.|$|E
50|$|Amniotic band {{syndrome}} {{is often difficult}} to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound. Often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs, digits, etc. Misdiagnosis is also common, so if there are any signs of <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity. 3D ultrasound and MRI can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damage/danger to the fetus.|$|E
50|$|During {{the fourth}} week of human {{development}} the neuropore in a normally developing fetus closes. When this process is either interrupted or never initiated, acrania occurs. The desmocranium becomes a membranous coverage instead of forming the epidermis of the scalp. Whether from being blocked by <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands</b> or by just not initiating, the migration of mesenchyme under the ectoderm does not occur. Because this migration does not occur, the skull, and all involved muscles, are never formed. Without {{the presence of the}} neurocranium, the brain fails to separate into two separate lobes. The hindbrain proceeds to develop normally, allowing for the child to be carried to term, but the diencephalon and ocular lobe remain small and underdeveloped.|$|E
40|$|Ashutosh HalderDepartment of Reproductive Biology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, IndiaAbstract: Six {{cases of}} <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> syndrome/limb body wall complex were studied {{in respect to}} clinicopathologic characteristics. The {{diagnosis}} was based on {{two out of three}} of the following manifestations: cranio facial clefts; limb body wall defects and <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> attachment. Four cases were stillborn and associated with internal defects, including central nervous system. Two cases had facial and limb defects and were live born (3 &ndash; 5 years old at examination). Phenotypic features of the stillborn cases were craniofacial clefting, thoracoabdominoschisis, amputation, ring constriction, <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> adhesion, placental adhesions, and internal malformations. Histology of bands revealed fibroconnective tissue as well as flattened epithelial cells together with neuroectodermal elements. Umbilical cord section revealed an abnormal number of vessels.

40|$|Objective: <b>Amniotic</b> <b>band</b> {{syndrome}} is an uncommon clinical entity with {{a spectrum of}} presentation including constriction rings, syndactyly, amputations, and spontaneous abortion. The bands themselves are not present {{at the time of}} birth. This has created controversy regarding the pathogenesis of the disorder. Methods: The unusual case of a neonate with a persistent <b>band</b> of fibrous <b>amniotic</b> material and the associated deformity of a constriction ring is evaluated. The significance of this unique case is discussed in the context of existing understanding of the syndrome. Results: The <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> was released in the neonatal intensive care unit shortly after birth. Despite removal of the band, the constriction ring persisted. Conclusion: The presence of a fibrous <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> at the site of a constriction ring is an extremely unusual finding. This case further demonstrates the importance of amniotic material in the etiology of constriction rings. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>band</b> {{syndrome is}} an uncommon clinical entity that has been recognized for centuries. 1, 2 The manifestations of <b>amniotic</b> <b>band</b> syndrome range from constriction rings of the thorax, extremities, and head, to syndactyly, 1, 3 – 5 to amputations, and to spontaneous abortion. 1 Seventy-seven percent of patients present with multiple anomalies. 6 At the tim...|$|R

40|$|In a fetopathologic {{evaluation}} of 18 cases with <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> we discerned 3 types of lesions: (1) constrictive tissue bands, (2) amniotic adhesions, and (3) more complex anomaly patterns, designated as limb-body wall complex (LBWC). Constrictive bands {{are caused by}} primary amnion rupture with subsequent entanglement of fetal parts (mostly limbs) by shriveled amniotic strands. Adhesive bands {{are the result of}} a broad fusion between disrupted fetal parts (mostly cephalic) and an intact amniotic membrane. Most of the craniofacial defects (encephaloceles and/or facial clefts) occurring in these fetuses are not caused by constrictive <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> but are the result of a vascular disruption sequence with or without cephalo-amniotic adhesion. Our observations confirm the fact that amnion rupture is not a conditio sine qua non for the development of LBWC. However, LBWC is often complicated by rupture of the unsupported amnion with ensuing formation of constrictive bands. We think that the concept that considers the 3 lesions in question as a single pathogenetic entity is erroneous and will inevitably lead to a never-ending debate between followers of the 2 prevailing theories. In our view, the theories of Streeter and Torpin are not mutually exclusive but rather apply to different types of lesions. The recognition of constrictive <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> amniotic adhesions, and LBWC as discrete but often combined disruption sequences with important pathogenetic overlap may resolve many dilemmas in interpretation when a fetus exhibits classical constrictive bands beside more severe defects. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Misoprostol is a {{synthetic}} prostaglandin analog administered vaginally to induce labor for intrauterine death or termination of pregnancy for congenital abnormalities. We encountered {{a case of}} misoprostol induction of labor at 14 weeks of gestation for fetal acrania associated with <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands.</b> Histology demonstrated abundant deposits of refractile material appearing to be of vegetable fiber origin on the maternal surface of the fetal membranes. Misoprostol tablet scrapings had a similar microscopic appearance. Ten additional placentas from cases of misoprostol induction of labor between 16 and 18 weeks of gestation were examined and half were found to contain such deposits. No deposits were seen in cases between 15 and 18 weeks of gestation where misoprostol was not used. We attribute the refractile material to a nonmedicinal ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, in the misoprostol tablet preparation. This study demonstrates that vaginal administration of misoprostol tablets can be detected microscopically in {{at least half of}} cases and may have a florid appearance simulating a potential causative factor of fetal malformation. Despite the large amounts of microcrystalline cellulose and its apparent embedding in placental tissue, the misoprostol in our index case was unlikely to have caused the <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands</b> and the resulting cranial abnormality...|$|E

40|$|Fetoscopic {{coagulation}} of placental anastomoses is {{the treatment}} of choice for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. In the present day, fetal laser therapy {{is also used to}} treat <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> chorioangiomas, sacrococcygeal teratomas, lower urinary tract obstructions and chest masses, all of which will be reviewed in this article. Amniotic band syndrome can cause limb amputation by impairing downstream blood flow. Large chorioangiomas (> 4 [*]cm), sacrococcygeal teratomas or fetal hyperechoic lung lesions can lead to fetal compromise and hydrops by vascular steal phenomenon or compression.

40|$|Amniotic band {{sequence}} (ABS) is {{an uncommon}} and heterogeneous congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts by fibrous <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands,</b> causing distinctive structural abnormalities involving limbs, trunk, and craniofacial regions. The incidence ranges between 1 / 1200 and 1 / 15, 000 live births, but {{is higher in}} stillbirths and previable fetuses. The intrinsic theory attributes the constriction band syndrome as an inherent development defect of embryogenesis while the extrinsic theory proposes that an early amnion rupture {{is responsible for the}} adherent bands. It is also suggested that amputations and constriction rings might be due to vascular disturbances. Anomalies resulting from <b>amniotic</b> <b>bands</b> are quite variable and sometimes may simulate chromosomal abnormalities. The authors report a case of a 36 -week-gestation male neonate who lived for 29 hours after a vaginal delivery with an Apgar score of 8 / 9 / 9. The mother was primipara, and the prenatal was uneventful except for two episodes of urinary tract infections. The newborn examination depicted multiple anomalies characterized by exencephaly, bilateral labial cleft with distorted nostrils and palate cleft. There was also facial skin tag band, exophthalmos with hypoplasia of the eyelids. The limbs showed distal amputation of the fingers in both hands and feet, oligodactyly associated with syndactyly in the left foot, ring constriction in the right leg, the presence of right hyperextension, and clubfoot. The upper limbs showed length discrepancies. Karyotype analysis was normal at 46 XY.
