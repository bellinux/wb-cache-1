5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E
5|$|Although Sadler was a {{committed}} Adventist {{for much of}} his early life, he stayed less involved after John Kellogg was excommunicated in 1907 {{in the wake of a}} conflict with Ellen G. White, the church's founder. The Sadlers became disenchanted with the church and subsequently criticized it. Sadler rejected some Adventist teachings, such as White's status as a prophetess <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> Saturday as Sabbath. He retained a positive view of White and rejected allegations that she was a charlatan.|$|E

5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E
5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted {{to try to stop}} the standardization.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{personally}} presided at {{the trial}} of John Lambert in November 1538 for denying the real presence.

5|$|Jeffrey Henderson {{writes that}} women {{were present in the}} theatre, citing Plato's Laws and Gorgias as saying that drama was {{addressed}} to men, women and children. Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre, such as the tale that Aeschylus' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into miscarrying. Other evidence of the presence of women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> women in Athenian rituals, especially those associated with Dionysus.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles {{is also home to}} a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious {{as well as the}} political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos.
