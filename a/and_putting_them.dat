5|$|The museum’s plan {{concept was}} {{developed}} by architect, Laurie Baker, without charging any fee, because of his interest in rural architectural design. Baker's approach included the use of local materials and the adaptation of artisanal production methods suited to the environment. Benny Kuriakose was the architect at site. Kuriakose, retained the main “spatial types and syntax”, but altered the layout plan. The {{southern part of the}} museum was devoted to restoring and recreating native structures <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> together in a sequence in the order of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu; a separate area was initially earmarked for the tribal people of these states but this was not put into effect.|$|E
5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.|$|E
5|$|Hershey {{defeated}} the Springfield Falcons 3–2 in a shootout on November 2, in which Boyd Kane and Matt Pope scored their first regulation {{goals of the}} season, and Galiev made the game-winner in the seventh round of the shootout, his first professional shootout attempt. In a subsequent 3–2 loss against the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on November 5, the Bears allowed a season-high 11 power plays, four of which were five-on-three. Hershey had 50 total penalty minutes in the game, compared to 115 minutes total in their first eight games. Stoa suffered an upper body injury that left him scratched until January 5. The Bears went 3-for-7 on the power play during a 3–1 victory against the Penguins on November 9, ending a 0-for-18 power play stretch; Holtby made 38 saves in the game. The Bears lost their next match 2–1 against the St. John's IceCaps on November 10. They were outshot 27 to 19, making a total of 359 to 266 for the season <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> 29th out of 30 {{in the league in}} shots.|$|E

5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Vanbiesbrouck {{was named}} to the All-Star Game. In the game, he played the second period and gave up three goals on seven shots. The Panthers were in playoff {{position}} {{for more than half of}} the season, but faltered late in the season and were close to falling out of the playoff race. Late in the season Vanbiesbrouck shutout the New Jersey Devils putting Florida into the playoffs. At the end of the regular season he played in 57 games posting a 21–25–11 with 2 shutouts. His games played ranked him tenth in the league while his GAA of 2.68 was ninth. In the first round Florida defeated the Boston Bruins in five games. Their second round match-up was against the heavily favored Philadelphia Flyers. Vanbiesbrouck posted a shutout in the first game of the series, the third post season shutout of his career and the first in Panthers playoff history. During the series Vanbiesbrouck held the Flyers scoreless for 116:46 straight minutes, as Florida upset Philadelphia winning four games to two. In the Conference Finals the Panthers were again huge underdogs to the Pittsburgh Penguins, a team that featured the leagues two top scorers in Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr. The Penguins took a 3–2 series lead, but the Panthers won game six 4–3 to force game seven. In game 7 Vanbiesbrouck made 39 saves in a 3–1 Panthers victory, winning the Eastern Conference <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Panthers fell behind the Colorado Avalanche 3–0 in the series. Game four was considered one of the classic games in finals' history. The game was a 0–0 tie entering the third overtime period. Early in the period, a long shot from Colorado's Uwe Krupp eluded Vanbiesbrouck giving the Avalanche a 1–0 win and the Stanley Cup. Vanbiesbrouck made 55 saves in the loss and finished third in voting for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.|$|E

25|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of violence}} in slums is armed violence (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums. It leads to homicide {{and the emergence of}} criminal gangs. Typical victims are male slum residents. Violence often leads to retaliatory and vigilante violence within the slum. Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well by picking up some men, beating them <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in jail. Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including verbal abuses and even physical violence from households.|$|E
25|$|Viking burial rituals were {{complex and}} dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala {{describes}} the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted {{of days of}} mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, {{it could not have}} solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.|$|E

25|$|On April 17, 2007, Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Hirofumi Hayashi {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} seven official documents in {{the archives of the}} Tokyo Trials, suggesting that Imperial military forces – such as the Tokkeitai (Naval military police) – forced women whose fathers attacked the Kenpeitai (Army military police) to work in front-line brothels in China, Indochina, and Indonesia. These documents were initially made public at the war crimes trial. In one of these, a lieutenant is quoted as confessing to having organized a brothel and having used it himself. Another source refers to Tokkeitai members having arrested women on the streets <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in brothels after enforced medical examinations.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the biology of the species, since it was not {{recognized}} as a separate species until after it is believed to have become extinct. Edgar Stead visited Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1936 and made several observations. He described the species as flying no more than “ten feet above the ground” and always after dusk. At one point he found seven bats roosting in a tree cavity in a state of torpor. After capturing a few <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in a cage they crawled around on the floor, much like New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are known to do. As well as roosting in tree cavities, it is known that they roosted in granite caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island.|$|E
25|$|Abbott's {{investigations}} {{have led to}} questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case. Police had believed that the Kensitas brand cigarettes in the Army Club packet were due to the common practice {{at the time of}} buying cheap cigarettes <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in a packet belonging to a more expensive brand (Australia was still under wartime rationing). However, a check of government gazettes of the day indicated that Kensitas were actually the expensive brand, which opens the possibility (never investigated) that the source of the poison may have been in the cigarettes that were possibly substituted for the victim's own without his knowledge. Abbott also tracked down the Barbour waxed cotton of the period and found packaging variations. This may provide clues to the country where it was purchased.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, several {{students}} are murdered, and thanks to Hajime's investigative skills, their killers are found out and executed. However, Hajime begins to realize something isn't quite right with the world, and discovers a terrible truth. He and his fellow students are in fact the surviving members of Ultimate Despair, a group led by the first game's antagonist, Junko Enoshima, whose sole purpose was to spread despair to the world. They managed to instigate a worldwide rebellion that caused society to collapse. However, one group, called the Future Foundation, has been attempting to undo the damage Ultimate Despair caused. They captured the surviving members, but instead of executing them, decided to try and rehabilitate them by erasing their memories <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in a virtual reality program.|$|E
25|$|Persecution of the Jews by the Nazi {{occupation}} government, {{particularly in}} the urban areas, began immediately after the commencement of the occupation. In {{the first year and}} a half, the Germans confined themselves to stripping the Jews of their property, herding them into ghettos (approximately 400 were established beginning in October 1939) <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> into forced labor in war-related industries. Thousands of Jews survived by managing to stay outside the ghettos. During this period, a Jewish so-called community leadership, Judenrat, was required by the Germans in every town with a substantial Jewish population and was able to some extent to bargain with the Germans. Already during this initial stage tens of thousands of Jews died because of factors such as overcrowding, disease and starvation. Others survived, supported by the Jewish social self-help agency and the informal trading and smuggling of food and necessities into the ghettos.|$|E
25|$|The Rangers {{defeated}} the Tampa Bay Lightning 5–1 on February 10, {{and beat the}} Boston Bruins in overtime on February 12. Boston tied game with a three-goal rally in the third period, including two goals in 91 seconds with the goaltender pulled, but Callahan made the game-winning shootout goal in the fourth round. During that game, the Rangers received their sixth penalty of the season for too many men on the ice, {{the most of any}} team in the league. They lost 3–4 in overtime against the New York Islanders on February 14, surrendering a 0–2 lead after the Islanders scored three goals in seven minutes during the second period. Hagelin scored his fourth goal in three games to tie the game, but they lost in an overtime shootout when Gaborik's and Nash's shots were stopped. The Rangers beat the Washington Capitals 2–1 on February 17, bringing New York to seventh place <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> in playoff contention for the first time all season.|$|E

25|$|Spurrier's first {{extended}} opportunity came in 1972, when {{an injured}} ankle left Brodie unable {{to play for}} over a month. San Francisco was 2-3 when Spurrier became the starter, and he led the team to a 6-1-1 record, throwing sixteen touchdowns over eight games <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> {{in a position to}} make the playoffs. Spurrier continued to start even after Brodie had recovered. However, when he threw three interceptions in the first half of the regular season finale, Brodie entered the game and led a second half comeback that clinched a playoff spot. Head coach Dick Nolan chose to start Brodie in the first round of the playoffs against the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers had beaten 31-10 on Thanksgiving Day with Spurrier starting. Spurrier did not make an appearance in the playoff rematch, and the Cowboys intercepted Brodie twice on their way to a 30-28 victory that ended the 49ers' season.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{historian}} Róbert Hermann {{writes in}} one of his studies, that during the battles around Zsigárd and Pered between 16–21 June, General Artúr Görgei committed one of his few great mistakes of his military career: the Hungarian main commander chose at 16 June not to command directly from the battlefield the actions of his new, inexperienced corps commanders, who because of this failed to coordinate their actions, and were defeated, with this letting the opportunity to win the battle to slip. Later he apologized himself writing that he wanted to put his new army corps commanders to the proof, but the importance of this battle {{for the future of the}} Hungarian revolutionary state was too high for such a risk. In the Spring campaign, when the commanders of the corps were the very talented and experienced Damjanich and Klapka, Görgei was every time nearby, but now when the new commanders were first time commanding an army corps, and when their tasks were far more difficult than in the former corps commanders had in the Spring Campaign, Görgei did not supported them. Another mistake of Görgei was the replacement of Colonel Lajos Asbóth, the most successful army corps commander of the first day of the Battle of Pered, 20 June with Colonel József Kászonyi, whose performance eased the task of the enemy forces to win the battle. But during the battle of Pered Görgei showed a great efficiency as high commander, turning several times the fate of the battle by reorganizing his retreating troops <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> to attack again. But he could not be in every place in the same time to hold the battle together, while his chief of the general staff, Colonel József Bayer did not shown up to help him, remaining in his bureau.|$|E
