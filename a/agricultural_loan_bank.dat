40|$|The study {{examines}} balance sheet changes at Texas commercial banks following the 1980 bank deregulation. A comparison of selected deposit and asset variables for 1978 (pre-deregulation) and 1987 (post- deregulation) reveals a {{rapid increase in}} costly deposits {{and a decline in}} the proportion of loans in general, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>loans</b> in particular, relative to total bank assets. Although a weak Texas economy during this time period contributed to the observed asset reallocation, banks were also responding to the increased deposit costs and interest rate volatility following deregulation. This conclusion is consistent with previous findings cited in the study. Commercial <b>banks,</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>Bank</b> deregulation, Financial Economics,...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios of <b>banks</b> serving agricultural producers in the southeastern U.

The main finding is that La Nina years are associated with on average three times lower charge-offs and more and larger <b>loans,</b> in <b>banks</b> focusing on agricultural lending in this region. The results suggest that ENSO impact on the agricultural lending is relatively small perhaps because farmers utilize well existing insurance mechanisms {{and take advantage of}} government disaster relief payments...|$|R
40|$|In an era {{of rapid}} {{consolidation}} in banking, the effect of mergers {{on the availability of}} credit to agricultural businesses is unclear. Commercial bank mergers have profoundly altered the urban credit marketplace and are positioned {{to do the same for}} the agricultural credit marketplace. Adjustment models are estimated with data on independent bank consolidations from 1988 through 1995. The regression results bode well for agricultural lending if acquiring banks have larger concentrations of assets in agriculture than acquired banks. Conversely, if acquiring banks have smaller concentrations than acquired banks, acquisitions have a negative impact on agricultural lending. Since most acquiring <b>banks</b> have smaller <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> concentrations than acquired banks, there is concern for agricultural lending. However, other lenders are likely to fill credit gaps that develop. acquisition, <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio, <b>banks,</b> consolidation, merger, Agricultural Finance, Industrial Organization,...|$|R
40|$|Do small, rural banks lend {{to farmers}} {{because they are}} small, or because they are rural? This paper {{combines}} a new measure {{of the extent of}} agricultural activity in banking markets with an appropriate statistical framework to examine causes of interbank variation in <b>agricultural</b> production <b>loans.</b> The results show that a bank's size and head office location both matter to some extent, but that the size of a bank's branches in agricultural areas {{is the single most important}} factor determining <b>agricultural</b> <b>loan</b> levels. Other variables, such as ownership structure and charter type, have no significant effects. While far from definitive, the results suggest that industry consolidation and mergers may have little effect on agricultural credit, as long as they do not lead to the outright closure of branches in rural areas. <b>Agricultural</b> credit; <b>Bank</b> <b>loans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Commercial <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> to New York {{farmers are}} {{significantly}} overestimated in the reported USDA statistics due to out-of-state lending and reporting of some agribusiness <b>loans</b> as <b>agricultural</b> <b>loans</b> by New York State banks.

Majority of farmers are much aware of climate change, about 91. 5 % were aware of the climate change and their impacts, only 8. 5 % do not; though they emphasize on the bad events of flood that happen in some years back that 54. 2 % of respondents have long years of experiencing climate change.
