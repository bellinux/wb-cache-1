5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E

25|$|Oz was {{not always}} a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> thus {{preventing}} its people from all contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.|$|E
25|$|Positioned on {{the shores}} of a glacial lake {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, Pickering was in an ideal place for early {{settlers}} to benefit from the multiple natural resources of the moorlands to the north, the wetlands to the south, running water in the beck and the forests <b>all</b> <b>around.</b> <b>It</b> had wood, stone, wildfowl, game, fish, fresh water and fertile easily worked soils. The east–west route from the coast passed along the foothills of the North York Moors through the site at a place where the beck could be forded.|$|E
25|$|By {{the next}} day, {{government}} forces recaptured Lysychansk. On the same day, fighting raged around Horlivka. Government forces launched air and artillery strikes on insurgents within the city, and clashes were fought <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> One important bridge {{collapsed in the}} fighting, severing a critical route out of the city. People fled the violence in cars and on foot. Despite these advances by the Armed Forces, the border with Russia was not secured. Izvaryne border post in Luhansk Oblast, which {{is controlled by the}} Army of the South-East, was reported to be the main entry point for weapons and reinforcements from Russia. Shelling began again in the Kyivskyi, Kirovskyi and Petrovskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to Donetsk city administration, eleven houses were damaged in Petrovsky, and at least one man was injured. The fighting continued overnight into 26 July, with explosions, shelling, and shooting heard across the city.|$|E

2500|$|A {{very famous}} {{ciborium}} that {{apparently did not}} stand over an altar was one that apparently functioned as a quasi-reliquary shrine or symbolic tomb for the missing remains of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Hagios Demetrios, the large and important church erected in Thessaloniki over the mass grave {{in which he was}} traditionally buried. [...] This appears, from various accounts of miracles associated with it, and depictions in mosaic, to have been a free-standing roofed structure inside the church, at one side of the nave, with doors or walls in precious metal <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> It was hexagonal and made of or covered with silver; inside there was a couch or bed. The roof had flat triangular panels rising shallowly to a central point. [...] It was rebuilt at least once. [...] A medium-sized 13th-century ciborium in a corner of San Marco, Venice, known as the capitello ("little chapel"), was used for the display of important icons and relics in the Middle Ages.|$|E
2500|$|The three spirit souls {{are located}} beneath the liver. They look like {{human beings and}} wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go {{wandering}} about. At this time, lie down with your feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart {{about the size of}} an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire <b>all</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: [...] "Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life!

2500|$|This {{version of}} the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with sharp angles and rounded sides. Its {{interior}} is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible <b>all</b> <b>around.</b> <b>It</b> is armed with guided immobilizer missiles and grappling cables. Being a [...] "single-seat" [...] by design, it {{was never meant to}} carry two people, as shown when Terry's friend Maxine was once sitting behind the seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicles top speed is Mach 3; however Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry's batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however another system consisting of holographic projector disguising it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence.|$|E

To date (2005), the northwest summit is the only unclimbed peak of the massif.|$|R
