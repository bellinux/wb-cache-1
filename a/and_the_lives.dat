On 1 January 1943, the Navy base at Garden Island was commissioned as HMAS Kuttabul in commemoration of the ferry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{began his}} career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After {{establishing}} himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lives</b> of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943).|$|E

5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Mallanarya of Gubbi, a poet bilingual in Kannada and Sanskrit, {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of King Krishnadeva Raya. His important writings in Kannada in the shatpadi metre are the Bhava Chintaratna (also called Satyendra Chole Kathe, 1513) and the Virasaivamrita Purana (1530). The former {{was based on}} a 7th-century Tamil work and about a Chola King {{in the context of the}} Shaiva faith; the latter is a writing of encyclopedic proportions that goes beyond philosophical content, describing the various forms (or sports, called lila) of god Shiva <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of famous Shaiva saints.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which {{part of the country}} they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E

5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Super Columbine Massacre was {{enormously}} negative; {{the title was}} criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the innocent. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super Columbine Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed {{as one of the}} possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing Columbine about his game and its impact.|$|E
