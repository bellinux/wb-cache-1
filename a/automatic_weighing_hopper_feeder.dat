40|$|Abstract. The work aims at the {{optimization}} of {{the output}} feed rate of a Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder</b> {{so that the}} best possible set of parameters affecting it can be selected to get the desired output. For this purpose the effect of various parameters on the feeder output is studied. To facilitate the study and detailed analysis, a statistical model is constructed {{which is used to}} predict and optimize the performance of the system. Efficient feed rate optimization determines the input variable settings to adjust the feed rate of the feeder according to the consumption of the parts in the next phase of production. The Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder,</b> whose performance is to be studied, consists of a rotating circular plate and a guiding hook fixed at the centre and running up to the periphery of the plate. As the plate rotates, the parts follow the trajectory of the hook, orient themselves and then eventually are delivered through the delivery chute, tangentially to the plate. The factors influencing the feeder’s performance include the speed of rotation of the disc, the population of the parts in the hopper and the size of parts to be fed. A series of experiments is performed on the three process parameters to investigate their effect on the feed rate. To study the interaction among the factors a full 23 factorial experiment approach has been adopted using the two basic principles of experimental design- replication and randomization. The process model was formulated based on Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab ® statistical package. The outcome is represented graphically and in the form of empirical model which defines the performance characteristics of the Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle <b>weighing</b> instruments or <b>automatic</b> rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, weighing of container wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry.

These results can then be used to compute the probabilities of a Markov model for the feeder. To demonstrate our technique, we present preliminary results for the design of two simple feeders. Our findings suggest that using dynamic simulation is a promising approach for designing parts feeders. 1 Introduction Vibratory bowl <b>feeders</b> and <b>hopper</b> <b>feeders</b> have proliferated industry as a cost-effective means for reliably orienting parts.

40|$|This work proposes and validates {{experimentally}} a model-based {{scheme for}} the compensation of environmental vibrations affecting load cell measurements in <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> machines. Weighing machines are often {{adversely affected by}} low frequency vibrations which may arise from the coupled effects of machine frame flexibility and the excitation induced by internal (inertial) or external (impact) vibration sources. These vibrations are generally named “environmental vibrations”, since they seem to arise from the environment around the machine. Environmental vibrations have a detrimental effect on load cell responses and can in turn deteriorate machine performances. It is usually ineffective to try overcoming this problem by low-pass filtering load cell measurements: low cut-off frequencies usually downgrade machine speed by both introducing delay and increasing filtered signal rise time. Since <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> machines need to operate at ever increasing speed, alternative approaches must be investigated. In this work it is suggested {{to make use of}} the mechanical models of the weighing machine and the load cells to process supplementary accelerometer measurements and compute an effective compensation of the effect of environmental vibrations on load cell response. The technique is here applied to a multi-head weighing machine in order to prove its effectiveness and implementability in industrial devices with real-time controllers...|$|R
40|$|The current {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} concentration of respirable coal mine dust is as follows. Each filter is preweighed by the filter manufacturer to 210. 1 mg. Following sampling with the Coal Mine Dust Personal Sample Unit (CPSU) at 2. 0 L/min, the filter with coal mine dust is sent to MSHA for weighing. The current MSHA procedure for weighing respirable dust samples uses a Mettler Model AE 163 analytical balance in conjunction with an <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system with a precision of 210. 02 mg [Tomb 19901. Each balance is calibrated twice per day. Quality control for the <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system includes the systematic weighing of one in eight filters on a second Mettler AE 163 balance. Tolerance is set at 210. 1 mg between the two weighings of the same sample. Weights are truncated at the 0. 1 mg level (e. g., 3. 457 mg is truncated to 3. 4 mg) [Bowman et al. 19851. The difference of the two truncated weights is then recorded as the weight of coal dust deposited. The respirable concentration (mg/m 3) is computed by multiplying by a correction equal to 1. 38 and dividing by the volume of air sampled (2. 0 L/min x sampling time [min]) ...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of food {{requirements}} {{is a key}} feature {{in the evaluation of}} the ecological status of the marine megafauna. However, this remains technically difficult because prey intake by marine top predators occurs mainly under water, out of sight. In this paper, we compare three independent methods currently available for use in quantitative dietary studies: (1) time-energy budget; (2) stomach-temperature measurements; and (3) <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing.</b> To this end, concurrent measurements were performed on Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo carbo) breeding in Normandy. According to the time-energy budget method, breeding males required 690 g of fish while incubating, 1050 g when rearing small chicks, and 1350 g when rearing large chicks; corresponding values for breeding females were 500, 760, and 970 g. These measurements are similar to estimates derived from <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> data, which gave a mean food intake of 540 and 390 g for incubating males and females, 1150 and 830 g for those tending small chicks, and 1410 and 1010 g for those tending large ones, respectively. Stomach-temperature measurements, which can only be performed for birds raising small chicks, were lower (640 g fish in males and 450 g in females) than those obtained using the other two methods. We compare these results with former estimates obtained at the same study site and for other Great Cormorant subspecies and discuss the relative accuracies of the three techniques. Finally, we stress that better assessment of the ecological status of marine top predators requires further technical improvements and additional investigations outside of the reproductive phas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new {{generation}} of extruder control system for recycled materials which has ability to automatically maintain constant a polymer melt viscosity of mixed recycled polymers during extrusion, regardless of variations in the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of recycled mixed grade high density polyethylene (HDPE) feedstock. The variations in MFI are due to differences in the source of the recycled material used. The work describes how melt viscosity for specific extruder/die system is calculated in real time using the rheological properties of the materials, the pressure drop through the extruder die and the actual throughput measurements using a gravimetric loss-in-weight <b>hopper</b> <b>feeder.</b> A closed-loop controller is also developed to automatically regulate screw speed and barrel temperature profile to achieve constant viscosity and enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled HDPE materials. Such a system will improve processability of mixed MFI polymers may also reduce the risk of polymer melt degradation, reduce producing large volumes of scrap/waste and lead to improvement in product quality.
