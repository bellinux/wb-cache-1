40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real options model of alliance formation between two firms {{for entry into}} a new market. We analyze how different compensation measures affect the alliance timing and option values. Generally, when profit structures of the two firms before and after an alliance are different, their individually optimal alliance timings do not coincide. Therefore, achieving an agreement on a common alliance timing becomes an important issue. To promote alliance formation, we examine two feasible compensation measures provided by one firm to the other: share <b>adjustment</b> (<b>flow</b> compensation) and subsidy (lump-sum compensation). We find that subsidy induces an earlier alliance, although share adjustment is Pareto optimal {{in terms of the}} joint option value. Real options Alliance Flow payment Lump-sum payment...|$|E

This study is therefore aimed at evaluating the influence of operating parameters on airborne emissions at the plant stack, especially Gaseous Organic Compounds (GOC), in addition to identifying both the best mixing conditions and bitumen influence through laboratory testing. Emission measurements have been performed for a given set of production conditions, and results highlight significant changes in emission flows.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{individual}} aspects of suture placement influence local haemodynamics within microarterial anastomoses. An attempt to physically quantify flow characteristics of blood past microvascular sutures is made using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Particular focus has been placed on increased shear strain rate (SSR), a known precipitant of intravascular platelet activation and thrombosis. Measurements were taken from micrographs of sutured anastomoses in chicken femoral vessels, with each assessed for bite width, suture angle and suture spacing. Computational geometries were then created to represent the anastomosis. Each suture characteristic was parameterised to allow independent or simultaneous <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Flow</b> rates were obtained from anonymised Doppler ultrasound scans of analogous vessels during preoperative assessment for autologous breast reconstruction. Vessel simulations were performed in 2. 5 mm ducts with blood as the working fluid. Vessel walls were non-compliant and a continuous Newtonian flow was applied, in accordance with current literature. Suture bite angle and spacing had significant effects on local haemodynamics, causing notably higher local SSRs, when simulated at extremes of surgical practice. A combined simulation, encompassing subtle changes of each suture parameter simultaneously i. e. representing optimum technique, created a more favourable SSR profile. As such, haemodynamic changes associated with optimum suture placement are unlikely to influence thrombus formation significantly. These findings support adherence to the basic principles of good microsurgical practice...|$|E

Immunophenotyping {{by using}} a flow cytometry method allows characterizing cells with the help {{monoclonal}} antibodies or any other probes and enables to judge their type and a functional condition on presence {{of this or that}} set of cellular markers and processes occurring in them.

Design considerations and functional analysis of a microvalve system are discussed, and manufacturing techniques analyzed. The design was verified by comparing the prototyped system to a commercially available mini ball valve. The valves were run through full actuation at varying pressures and the resulting flow was observed and characterized.

40|$|Abstract. The layered {{recovery}} {{technology has}} been applied to the heterogeneous multi-layer standstone oilfields for many years. However, as these standstone oilfields have been entering into the ultra-high water cut period, the conventional layered water injection technology has too long test and adjustment period and heavy workload and cannot determine the reservoir condition. To solve this problem, this paper proposes and develops an intelligent multi-layer water injection technology suitable for the ultra-high water cut period based on the synchronous dynamic test and adjustment idea. The whole <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> process has no any intervention and the synchronous dynamic <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> of each layer finishes by the digital clock calibration thereby avoiding interlayer interference. This technology also can obtain data by the redisplay of computer.

While their model offers a new method for modeling traffic evolution, it contains an ad-hoc step of <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> to preserve the flow conservation. This <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> step leads to difficulties in analyzing the system properties.

The generalized formulation provides the ease to construct a variety of day-to-day traffic assignment models, and serves as a framework for analyzing the models’ properties, such as the invariance property and the preservation of the Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity. Specifically, a proportional-adjustment model and a projection-type model are developed based on the proposed generalized formulation.
