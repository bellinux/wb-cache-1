5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the <b>air</b> <b>strip</b> was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard {{remained}} {{unaffected by}} the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, {{as well as a}} source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet–British occupation; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-Ålesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen, and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated. With Longyearbyen depopulated, a small German garrison and <b>air</b> <b>strip</b> was established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>air</b> <b>strip</b> on Svalbard was {{constructed}} in Adventdalen, near Longyearbyen, by the Luftwaffe during World War II. This was not used after the war; during the summer the archipelago was served by ships, but was completely isolated from November to May. In the early 1950s, the Norwegian Air Force started postal flights using a Catalina aircraft that departed from Tromsø and dropped postal parcels at Bear Island and at Longyearbyen. However, these aircraft never landed until 9 February 1959, when a resident had become seriously ill, {{and needed to be}} flown to mainland Norway for treatment. The mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani cleared the runway at Adventsdalen and the 14-hour flight and landing was successful. A second landing, this time for delivery of post, was made on 11 March.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{removal of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds from biological treatment processes occurs through several mechanisms. These include biodegradation, adsorption onto solids, and <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> or volatilization to the atmosphere. Volatilization results in fugitive emissions to the atmosphere, which is largely uncontrolled. Recent regulations have called for increased evaluation and control of inadvertent {{volatile organic compounds}} emissions from treatment processes. The use oxygen as a parallel volatile compound is extremely useful for prediction of volatile organic compounds removal by <b>air</b> <b>stripping.</b> In this study, the simultaneous biodegradation and <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> of volatile organic compounds, based on steady state mass balance are examined and a general approach to estimating the dominant removal mechanism is developed. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to estimate <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions. Several volatile organic compounds were selected for this study. The results showed the values drived from the model correspond with the experimental data for benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and methyl isobutyl ketone...|$|R
5|$|In 1985, five tammar {{wallabies}} {{were introduced}} onto North Island, {{and the population}} established successfully. Possible reasons for this success include {{the absence of the}} wallabies' natural predator, the carpet python (Morelia spilota imbricata); the availability of additional food and water from the fishers' huts, which are occupied during the harshest time of the year; and the presence of the <b>air</b> <b>strip,</b> which apparently provides additional food for them. By the 2000s, there were over 450 tammar wallabies on the island. The wallabies overgrazed and ringbarked the native vegetation, particularly the area burnt in 1935, thus reducing vegetation cover and causing a serious decline in populations of some plant species. In 2003, island residents asked the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation) for help in managing the issue. CALM staff visited the island in April and May of that year and produced a report recommending an investigation into controlling population levels by the use of implanted contraceptives. Exploration of this option began in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued. Around 60 wallabies were removed to educational institutions for research purposes, and culling began. By February 2008, the wallaby population had been reduced to around 25 individuals.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} removal of mercury from {{wastewater}} using chemical reduction and <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> using a full-scale treatment system at the Savannah River Site. The existing water treatment system utilizes <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> as the unit operation to remove organic compounds from groundwater that also contains mercury (C ~ 250 ng/L). The baseline <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> process was ineffective in removing mercury and the water exceeded a proposed limit of 51 ng/L. To test an enhancement to the existing treatment modality a continuous dose of reducing agent was injected for 6 -hours at the inlet of the air stripper. This action resulted in the chemical reduction of mercury to Hg(0), a species that is removable with the existing unit operation. During the injection period a 94 % decrease in concentration was observed and the effluent satisfied proposed limits. The process was optimized over a 2 -day period by sequentially evaluating dose rates ranging from 0. 64 X to 297 X stoichiometry. A minimum dose of 16 X stoichiometry was necessary to initiate the reduction reaction that facilitated the mercury removal. Competing electron acceptors likely inhibited the reaction at the lower 1 doses, which prevented removal by <b>air</b> <b>stripping.</b> These results indicate that chemical reduction coupled with <b>air</b> <b>stripping</b> can effectively treat large-volumes of water to emerging part per trillion regulatory standards for mercury...|$|R
