40|$|Correct {{ergonomic}} design of work systems {{is a major}} challenge in industrial societies {{and is one of}} the most important requirements for ensuring humane and economic use of human labor. Virtual human models and virtual reality systems are significant aids to {{ergonomic design}}. This paper describes the principle requirements for developing virtual human models and the design concept of the virtual human model system VirtualANTHROPOS. The VirtualANTHROPOS system is initially being used in assembly planning. By <b>assembling</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantling</b> products virtually, the planner can acquire important data on the economic use of space and on human biokinematics. VirtualANTHROPOS can simulate assembly sequences interactively in a virtual environment that reproduces real production conditions. When determining the optimal method and sequence of assembly, it takes account of the structure and geometry of the relevant product and of the restrictions imposed by inadequate space or limited accessibility...|$|E

It was powered by a seven-cylinder, 80 PS Oberursel U.0 rotary engine — basically a German-made near-clone of the Gnome Lambda pre-war French rotary — mounted on struts between the wings driving a pusher propeller. The pilot had an open cockpit just forward of the lower wing. Because of the slender hull stabilising floats were fitted below {{and at the end of}} the lower wings.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamical}} {{systems approach}} addresses Bernstein's {{degrees of freedom}} problem by assuming that the neuro-musculo-skeletal system transiently <b>assembles</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantles</b> its components into functional units (or synergies) to meet task demands. Strikingly, little is known from a dynamical {{point of view about}} the functioning of the muscular subsystem in this process. To investigate the interaction between the dynamical organisation at muscular and behavioural levels, we searched for specific signatures of a phase transition in muscular coordination when a transition is displayed at the behavioural level. Our results provide evidence that, during Fitts' task when behaviour switches to a different dynamical regime, muscular activation displays typical signatures of a phase transition; a reorganisation in muscular coordination patterns accompanied by a peak in the variability of muscle activation. This suggests that consistent changes occur in coordination processes across the different levels of description (i. e., behaviour and muscles). Specifically, in Fitts' task, target size acts as a control parameter that induces a destabilisation and a reorganisation of coordination patterns at different levels of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system...|$|R

Accordingly, there is now a strong impetus to discover new ways of looking at the workings of proteins in living cells. Although the use of fluorescent tags to track individual proteins in cells has a long history, the availability of laser-based confocal microscopes and the imaginative exploitation of the green fluorescent protein from jellyfish have provided new tools of great diversity and utility. It is now possible to watch a protein bind its substrate or its partners in real time and with submicron resolution within a single cell.

40|$|T Lymphocyte {{activation}} {{involves a}} substantial {{reorganization of the}} membranous and intracellular compartments. Signaling complexes <b>assemble</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantle</b> in a highly ordered fashion in both compartments and orchestrate the activation of T cells with high sensitivity and specificity. TCR ligation leads to a short burst of cAMP production, which is centrally required for T cell activation; however, sustained elevations in intracellular cAMP concentrations are immunosuppressive. Emerging evidence {{of the existence of}} local cAMP pools gleaned from studies on other cell types suggests that cAMP compartmentalization may account, in part, for these opposing effects. Whereas cAMP compartmentalization has been identified as a central factor in the control of the cAMP-dependent processes in other cell types, this has, as yet, not been addressed in T lymphocytes. In this review, we discuss the role of cAMP in T cell activation and differentiation, with an emphasis on the effects mediated by the cAMP effectors, protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) 1, and on the regulatory proteins that may control the generation of local cAMP pools in T cells. We also present an overview of the available tools to image cAMP production at the subcellular level and discuss how bacterial adenylate cyclase (AC) toxins that are known to generate local cAMP pools can be exploited to address the role of cAMP compartmentalization in T cell activation...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend towards}} {{teaching}} by facilitating learning {{rather than by}} direct instruction is an important one. As part of this movement, {{there is a growing}} interest in the concept of interactive learning environments (ILEs), where students learn by experimenting with a computer system that simulates some device, system or situation. Although ILEs can act as effective teaching aids they are time-consuming to create. In this thesis, principles that are useful for guiding the development of these systems are proposed, and design issues are explored. In order to determine what the principles for development should be, the history of teaching by computer is reviewed, with an emphasis on interactive systems that have a learning rather than instructional bias. The important concepts of modelling, discovery learning and fidelity are examined in some detail. One of the conclusions of the initial survey {{is that it is not}} feasible to think in terms of general design primitives that can be used for the development of all interactive learning environments. Since there is a diverse range of possible environments, two specific types are examined. In each case, a framework for design is proposed. First, the teaching of procedural skills is considered. These skills include the ability to understand the operation of mechanical devices, to be able to carry out tasks with them, <b>and</b> to correctly <b>assemble</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantle</b> pieces of equipment. Providing a realistic model which can include informative feedback is seen as important. It is demonstrated that a scheme adapted from AI planning can economically provide an appropriate level of fidelity for modelling device operation. A compatible notation for denoting tasks is also developed. A methodology for the design of ILEs for teaching procedural skills is proposed, complete with graphical specification for both domains and tasks. It is envisaged that such a scheme would allow domain experts and teachers to take a full part in the design process, even if they are unable to write or understand computer programs. The second kind of ILE considered involves the simulation of human behaviour. Two schemes for knowledge-based simulation are examined: one based on CYC and one on Schank and Abelson's behavioural model. The former is used to outline a system for simulating problem-oriented policing. The latter is extended to facilitate the development of knowledge-based simulation teaching systems. This second scheme is then applied to the simulation of domestic disputes. Since many of the problems of simulating real world events by computer software have yet to be solved, a full computer implementation is not yet a realistic proposition. Instead, the domestic disputes model is tested using a 'Wizard of Oz'approach. Results show that a scheme based on the model proposed is feasible, that subjects can successfully use such a system and that, as a result, they believe their understanding of the issues being presented is improved...|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} business grew quickly, but Comino {{never felt}} happy in printing and wanted further business challenges. In 1937, he established Dexion Ltd (from the Greek for 'right') to market products {{he had developed}} and patented to improve {{the efficiency of the}} printing process. These included: a gauge to check the squareness and register of a printer's forme; trolleys; chutes; a duplicate book; interlocking frames to hold print in place inside the chase; and a compositor's chart. As a printer, he was also concerned about the lack of versatility of the wooden shelving often for storing paper and other consumables. He began to work on steel shelving which could readily be <b>assembled,</b> <b>dismantled</b> <b>and</b> then reassembled. By 1939 he had developed an angled section made of steel with slots cut down one side and a long groove cut down the other. Birmingham-based Accles & Pollock manufactured an initial batch which was delivered in late August, a week before the declaration of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, and Comino sold most of this angled section to local stores of Lillywhites, John Lewis and Selfridges.|$|R
