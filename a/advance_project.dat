[...] This aircraft, which could also feature new engines, would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. [...] Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021. [...] On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build {{a new version of}} the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines. Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (neo for new engine option) had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014, and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900 and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. [...] Brégier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020.

40|$|Since declaring {{independence}} in 1957, the Republic of Ghana {{has become a}} stable constitutional democracy. Ghana’s economy has grown substantially over the past decade, yet remains primarily agrarian, accounting for 50 % of the total employment and 25 % of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Smallholder rain-fed farming using rudimentary technologies dominates the agricultural sector accounting for 80 % of total agricultural production. Approximately 90 % of smallholder farms are less than two hectares in size, and produce a diversity of crops. The major crops cultivated in Ghana include numerous cereal, root and tuber, leguminous, fruit, vegetable and industrial crops. Maize is the most widely cultivated crop in Ghana, and accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} the daily caloric intake. However, significant yield gaps exist where actual maize yields are 50 to 80 % less than achievable yields. The following document was written after conducting a three month 2012 summer internship in Ghana as an agronomic expert volunteer for the Ghana Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement (<b>ADVANCE)</b> <b>Project.</b> My primary objectives included monitoring ADVANCE crop production demonstration plots and farmers’ fields to diagnose and address crop health issues, with the goal of identifying why smallholders in the north continue to get lower than expected yields even when good agronomic practices (GAPs) are being implemented. Observations indicate GAPs are not being adopted, partly because they are not often being implemented correctly at demonstration plots. The benefits of GAPs can be better realized through improved planning, communication, cooperation and education among all participants. This document is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the Republic of Ghana. Chapter 2 is a brief introduction to agriculture production in Ghana, emphasizing agriculture in the northern savannah and the major challenges facing development in the north. Chapter 3 is a detailed summary of my experience working on the <b>ADVANCE</b> <b>Project.</b> The final chapter discusses how agricultural development—in particular maize productivity—can be improved in the northern savannah of Ghana.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an in-depth investigation of situated activities of developers and managers during an embedded system development. Previous empirical investigations claim that software design may involve activities outside the continuum of methodologies, such as improvisation or situated activities. Those activities may involve reflexive practices that are purposefully applied by developers and managers. This research provides a better understanding how reflexive behaviors shape the development process by adopting an interpretive approach. The study involved the collection and analysis of qualitative data that were gathered during a 16 -month field study carried out in an automotive company. This paper offers insights into everyday actions and practices, the role of reflexivity, and different consciousness levels of reflexive practices of developers and managers. The paper argues that nurturing reflexivity can positively influence information system developments. Furthermore, this paper points out how reflexivity could be encouraged to <b>advance</b> <b>project</b> work and organizational processes...|$|E

The range of services included in this directory stretch far beyond those directly dealing with drugs, alcohol and addiction. This is because problematic drug use rarely exists in isolation and can have an effect on many aspects of an individual’s life and their family’s life. The non-drug specific services listed in this directory work equally with people with no history of drug use, and so this is a valuable resource for everyone living in the community. Looking for support when problems arise can be difficult. It is hoped that this directory will make taking that first step to getting help easier for everyone...|$|E
