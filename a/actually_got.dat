5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> to the point where Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E

5000|$|During the writing/recording process, Sahaj had to {{go through}} surgery to repair a {{ruptured}} disc in his back. Due to his obvious physical discomfort, Sahaj admitted to rushing the creation of the album. PJ Farley said, [...] "It was a unique process because, {{this was the first time}} that we <b>actually</b> just <b>got</b> in a room and jammed and just hashed out material and would just hit record and play for hours".|$|R

George Kailis [...] In support of the album's release the band gave a number of performances in Perth and Melbourne in early 2009.|$|R
25|$|This {{match was}} eerily {{similar to the}} one two days earlier – except that Jason Gillespie <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> rewards with the ball, and the batsman to play himself into form was Adam Gilchrist – however, both England and Australia picked batsmen as their supersubs, just like on 10 July. Australia won the toss, chose to field to gain an extra batsman, and had England on the rack.|$|E
25|$|Point Break is an American-German-Chinese co-{{production}}. Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw {{production services}} for the film. A script for the remake had been lying around for years, {{but it was not}} until Ericson Core pitched his idea to Warner Bros. that the film <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> off the ground. However, Core's idea for the film was significantly different than the script. His concept was much more of a big tentpole movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E
25|$|Septimius Severus {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic {{language}} fluently and possibly the Berber language too, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education, but according to Cassius Dio the boy had been eager for more education than he had <b>actually</b> <b>got.</b> Presumably Severus received lessons in oratory: at age 17 he gave his first public speech.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew and}} {{passengers}} took refuge in the rigging, but {{one by one the}} masts broke and went over the side and the men were hurled into the breakers. There was little opportunity for her crew to save themselves. The ship had struck well off shore and only four men reached it - a passenger, two able seamen and an apprentice. None of the survivors remembered how they <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> ashore; they heard the crash of the masts, and then felt the wreckage bumping them about in the surf.|$|E
25|$|Parnell worked untiringly between Ireland and Britain making speeches {{for support}} which he <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> from the (IRB) Fenians who rallied to him. He was married in June 1891 to Mrs O’Shea. After an {{election}} {{tour in the}} west of Ireland, his health deteriorated seriously, and he died in October in their Brighton home. His funeral in Dublin was attended by 200,000 people. In his speeches he was convinced of an Ireland completely separated from Britain, but was ambiguous, never committing himself nor distancing himself, {{from the use of}} physical-force.|$|E

The decision <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> backfired for his parents but worked in the well-being of Nepali cricket. For {{a guy who was}} bowling over 130 kmmph, he was already a national team material. They called him for the camps in Kathmandu and now, impressive with the raw pace and the physique he carries, Karan is now expected to be the next generation seamer of Nepali cricket. He has already proved himself many times and is expected to carry Nepal into glory.|$|E
5000|$|It {{seems to}} be {{distinct}} from legendary Aegae, the namesake of the Aegean Sea, which was situated {{on the east coast}} of the island, near modern Kymi. It's not unlikely that Aegae <b>got</b> <b>actually</b> switched to Kymi/Cuma, as the generic name Kymi/Cuma, just means city in the Aeolic dialect.|$|R
60|$|The barbarians {{had done}} much less {{injury to the}} ship and her {{contents}} than under the circumstances could have been reasonably hoped. The fact that nothing could be effectually landed where she lay was probably the cause, the bales that had <b>actually</b> been <b>got</b> out of the ship, having been put upon the bank {{with a view to}} lighten her, more than for any other reason. The compact, too, between the chiefs had its influence probably, though it could not have lasted long with so strong temptations to violate it constantly before the eyes of men habitually rapacious.|$|R

25|$|Clodius {{sought to}} become a plebeian tribune {{so that he could}} enjoy the powers of these tribunes to pursue his revenge against Cicero. These powers {{included}} presiding over the plebeian council and propose bills to its vote and the power to veto the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta (written opinions of the senate on bills, which were presented for advice and usually followed to the letter). However, Clodius was a patrician and the plebeian tribunate was exclusively for plebeians. Therefore, he needed to be transferred to the plebeian order (transitio ad plebem) by being adopted into a plebeian family. In some letters written in 62 BC, the year after Clodius’s trial, Cicero wrote that Herrenius, a plebeian tribune, made frequent proposals to the plebeian council to transfer Clodius to the plebs, but he was vetoed by many of his colleagues. He also proposed a law to the plebeian council to authorise the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers) to vote on the matter. The consul Quintus Metellus Celer proposed an identical bill to the comitia centuriata. Later in the year, Cicero wrote that Metellus Celer was ‘offering Clodius ‘a splendid opposition’. The whole senate rejected it. Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that in that year Clodius <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> his transitio ad plebem and immediately sought the tribunate. However, he was not elected due to the opposition of Metellus Celer, who argued that his transitio ad plebem was not done in accordance with tradition because this had to be done according to the lex curiata, which provided that adrogatio should be performed in the comitia curiata. In other words, Metellus Celer argued that the adoption was illegal. Cassius Dio wrote that this ended the episode. During his consulship Caesar effected this transitio ad plebem and had him elected as plebeian tribune with the cooperation of Pompey. Clodius silenced Calpurnius Bibulus when he wanted to make a speech {{on the last day of}} his consulship in 59 BC and also attacked Cicero.|$|E
500|$|Corman {{has noted}} that making the film was a pleasurable experience: [...] "I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum because I <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> the chance to {{experiment}} a bit with {{the movement of the}} camera.

5000|$|The {{episode of}} South Park {{entitled}} [...] "Eek, a Penis!" [...] borrows heavily from {{the plot of}} Stand and Deliver, with Cartman assuming a similar role to that played by Edward James Olmos, but in the film, the students were falsely accused of cheating. In the episode, the students <b>actually</b> cheated and <b>got</b> away with it.|$|R
5000|$|... "I was {{experimenting with}} moving {{intervals}} in my playing, doing seconds and thirds to fourths and fifths. It was creating a different sound instead of typical jazz lines. The intervals were opened up. The {{idea was to}} try to make it sound simple even though it was music that was hard to figure out. Harold started playing the intervals, too, so that we could bounce off each other. <b>Actually,</b> I <b>got</b> a lot of my ideas from Joe Chambers, who was always trying to change the recipe. 'Pompeian' is full of the intervals playing--which actually reflected the scene that was going on in San Franciscoat the time." [...] Bobby Hutcherson ...|$|R
5000|$|On September 24, 2006, Williams eclipsed Earl Anthony's then-recognized career {{record of}} 41 PBA regular tour titles with his 42nd win at the Dydo Japan Cup over Pete Weber in a 289-236 single game pinfall. Anthony's title count was amended to 43 in 2008, when the PBA chose to include ABC Masters titles earned by a PBA member as PBA Tour titles.

500|$|After {{the episode}} is over, Patchy claims {{he took some}} time off, but Potty then tells the viewers that Patchy <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> fired, and Patchy gets back at Potty by saying that he got fired too, which is also true (but Potty also got a golden parachute). Patchy then says that they cannot replace him, but Potty tells him that they already did. When Patchy finds out that he's been {{replaced}} by a gorilla, he calls it a [...] "smelly, hairy fleabag", to which the gorilla fiercely responds to by throwing patties at Patchy. The narrator then tell the Viewers to always follow your dreams (unless you're Patchy), and then the episode ends.|$|E
500|$|Michael Cassidy {{appears in}} seven episodes of season seven as the Daily Planets newest editor, Grant Gabriel, {{and the love}} {{interest}} for Lois this season. Shortly after hiring Lois, which he did in part to inspire better stories out of Chloe, Grant begins a romantic relationship with Lois in the episode [...] "Wrath". The couple's secret is discovered by Chloe and Lex in [...] "Blue", who both insist Lois and Grant break up to prevent questions about how Lois <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> her job.

After Lex buys the Daily Planet in season seven's [...] "Gemini", it is revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's baby brother Julian, who died as an infant. When Grant discovers this information, he attempts to connect with Lionel in the episode [...] "Persona", to keep Lex from controlling his life. When Lex cannot control Grant, he has him murdered, staging it as a failed mugging.|$|E
60|$|The {{first person}} that descended, after the exit of Mrs. Bloomfield, was Captain Truck, who, however, instead of saluting his friends, turned assiduously {{to the door}} he had just passed through, to assist Mrs. Hawker to alight. Not until this office had been done, did he even look for Eve; for, so {{profound}} was the worthy captain's admiration and respect for this venerable lady, that she <b>actually</b> had <b>got</b> to supplant our heroine, in some measure, in his heart. Mr. Bloomfield appeared next, and an exclamation of surprise and pleasure proceeded from both Paul and the baronet, as they {{caught a glimpse of}} the face of the last of the travellers that got out.|$|R
5000|$|Despite being six, Calvin often expresses {{imagination}} and naivete, though these are often contrasted with his intelligence.

500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} about the single-player campaign. GameSpot {{thought it was}} [...] "standard for a {{real-time}} strategy game", but also complained that it had [...] "less-than-stellar voice work and awkward cutscenes;" [...] GameSpy agreed that [...] "Age of Empires IIIs campaign is not revolutionary", but thought that [...] "the voice acting is great." [...] IGN praised the campaign's story, in that it gave the player a [...] "nice sense of purpose"; they thought [...] "The 24-mission campaign is very well designed." [...] Eurogamer said the campaign lacked originality, stating, though [...] "well-written and imaginatively framed," [...] the campaign [...] "offers exactly {{the same kind of}} challenges that RTS campaigns have been offering for years;" [...] Game Revolution disliked the campaign more than the other reviewers. Comparing it to Age of Empires IIs campaign, they said: [...] "The plot <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> worse. Age of Empires III...avoids all the interesting and prickly issues like genocide, epidemics and slavery, instead subbing in a wimpy tale of a family destined to protect the Holy Grail from a Satanic Cult." ...|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe {{displayed}} artistic talent at {{an early}} age. Helen Anderson, a fellow student, remembered his early works as being very aggressive, with dark, moody colours, which was {{not the type of}} painting she expected from such a [...] "quiet student". One of Sutcliffe's paintings was shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool as part of the John Moores exhibition, from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, Moores bought Sutcliffe's canvas for £65 ( [...] , which was then equal to 6–7 weeks' wages for an average working man. The picture Moore bought was called Summer Painting, and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student, Susan Williams. Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> to the exhibition (because they stopped off in a pub to celebrate), but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son.|$|E

I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> the beat and we did it in no time.
