40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{teachers}} in the subject of social studies are working with and argue for their <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance.</b> The questions <b>of</b> this study are: How do the social study teachers use <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance?</b> Which work areas consists <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance?</b> What knowledge is measured during <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance?</b> What arguments have teachers to assess oral student performance? Qualitative methodology was considered appropriate to answer the study's purpose and issues by using semi-structured interviews. A targeted selection was used and the criterion for participation in the study was that the teachers taught in social studies in high school. Differences as gender, age, and schools are also part of the selection process. The results show that all the teacher´s <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> are both summative and formative. They are also both formal and informal. Informal <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> are summative while the formal assessments also occurs formative. The results also show that the most common knowledge is factual knowledge and conceptual knowledge during these <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance.</b> The most common cognitive process is understanding and remembering. All the teachers in the study describe <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> as time consuming. <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> is more common in non-academic high school programs. The final part of this study shows that the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> is summative, formative, formal and informal. There are no working areas that fits better for oral assessments, but when the teachers in this study describes how they are using <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> some working areas recur. The teachers in this study describe several arguments for the use <b>of</b> oral <b>assessments.</b> The most common argument is that <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> oral student <b>performance</b> are part <b>of</b> the variety of examinations. Other arguments are that it will make it easier for students, especially students in non-academic programs or to reveal those students who cheat on essays or big writing assignments...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship of participant attitudes toward the corporation and the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> trainee <b>performances</b> in training by participants and by their instructors. The population for the study consisted of about 600 trainees present daily at the Bell System Center for Technical Education at Lisle, Illinois. A cluster sample of 101 trainees from five classes and their instructors were included in the study. Participant attitudes toward the corporation were measured by use of the Work Environment Preference Schedule (WEPS). <b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in training were obtained by use of two instruments developed by the researcher. Nine null hypotheses were tested and the responses were analyzed by use of the Pearson R product-moment of correlation and the t-Test for non-independent samples. Data were also analyzed by sex, age, job level, and possession of bachelor degree. Among the general conclusions resulting from the study were the following: (1) there were no relationships between participant attitudes toward the corporation and the <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>performances</b> in training by participants and by their instructors; (2) there were no relationships or differences between pre-course and post-course attitudes toward the corporation; (3) <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> trainee <b>performance</b> in training by participants and by their instructors were nearly the same in rank order but instructor assessments were lower than self-assessments of trainees; (4) there were positive correlations between <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in training by participants and by their instructors when compared to test scores received by participants of the one class for which these scores were available. The findings of this study indicate that participant attitudes toward the corporation have very little effect upon their performances in corporate training. A secondary finding lends support to the idea that trainee performances in training can be assessed not only by the instructors but also by the participants themselves...|$|R

As against CIC's view that PAR was [...] "confidential personal information", Pradhan contended that PAR is the appraisal committee's impersonal evaluation of the public service rendered by public servants in their impersonal capacity in a public organisation; and hence there is nothing personal about PAR. Following his petition, RBI began disclosing the PAR reports to all employees before moving over to a system of Objective <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Performance.</b> In the words of Smt Usha Thorat, the ex-Deputy Governor of RBI, Pradhan makes [...] "ingenious use of the RTI Act" [...] to redress individual grievances.|$|E

It became apparent that the Act was not an effective means of civic service reform.When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1982, he significantly reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying the need for new legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E
