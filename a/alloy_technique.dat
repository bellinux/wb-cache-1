40|$|III-(As, Sb) alloys are {{building}} blocks for various advanced optoelectronic devices, but the growth of their ternary or quaternary materials are commonly limited by spontaneous formation of clusters and phase separations during alloying. Recently, digital alloy growth by molecular beam epitaxy has been widely adopted in preference to conventional random alloy growth because of the extra degree of control offered by the ordered alloying. In this article, we provide a comparative study of the optical characteristics of AlAsSb alloys grown lattice-matched to GaSb using both techniques. The sample grown by digital <b>alloy</b> <b>technique</b> showed stronger photoluminescence intensity, narrower peak linewidth, and larger carrier activation energy than the random <b>alloy</b> <b>technique,</b> indicating an improved optical quality with lower density of non-radiative recombination centers. In addition, a relatively long carrier lifetime was observed from the digital alloy sample, consistent with the results obtained from the photoluminescence study...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{mid-infrared}} (2 - 5 µm) semiconductor lasers {{operating at}} or near room temperature have been sought for use in LADAR, gas sensing, and spectroscopy. Smaller bandgap materials necessary for this range {{are more susceptible to}} non-radiative Auger recombination. Further, as laser structures become more complicated, like quantum cascade intersubband and interband lasers, Shockley-Read-Hall losses increase. The simplest structure is Type-I multiple quantum well (MQW), but few QW III-V heterojunction material systems capable of 2 - 5 µm emission have a Type-I offset. One such system with InAsSb wells and AlInAsSb barriers has been unable to exceed 175 K under CW operation partially due to poor carrier confinement associated with small valence band offsets. This paper describes the growth and performance of AlInAsSb/InAsSb lasers using a 0. 3 mole fraction of Al in the Group III elements. Increased Al content enhances the valence and conduction band offsets, but the AlInAsSb alloy exhibits a miscibility gap above 0. 06 Al mole fraction, so a digital <b>alloy</b> <b>technique</b> was used to grow high quality 0. 3 - 2 µm thick quaternary films. As Al mole fraction in the barriers was increased from 0. 20 to 0. 30 an 80 -fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) was observed. The corresponding lasers were grown and tested demonstrating lasing at 3. 9 µm and 50 K. Theoretical studies suggest that adding Ga to the barriers, forming an AlGaInAsSb quinary alloy, results in band structures more favorable towards minimizing Auger effects and realizing Type I offset behavior over a wider range of alloy compositions. PL structures were grown and tested, again using a digital <b>alloy</b> <b>technique</b> for the quinary alloy. Preliminary results show promise...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the method}} in powder {{metallurgy}} namely as mechanical alloying {{is not only a}} simple and inexpensive process, but also a promising technique in improving material’s properties. However, the final product is highly depending on the milling parameters and conditions and very sensitive to environmental factors. In this present study, processing of Ti-Al powders by mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>technique</b> and subsequent heat treatment was performed with the purpose to gain better understanding of their effect on structural and phase formation of the titanium aluminide alloys, and its relationships to physical, thermal and mechanical properties. It was found that, dry milling at an intermediate speed of 300 rpm is the most optimum condition to produce Ti-Al with crystallite size in nano range. Solid state reaction during mechanical alloying resulted in the formation of Ti(Al) solid solution and remarkable reduction of crystallite size as low as 20 nm. In the initial stage of milling, the thermal stability was influenced by the crystallite size refinement, but after prolonged milling, the stability was regulated by alloying degree of powder constituent. The density and micro-hardness value tag along with the crystallite refinement with gradual decreased of densities from 4. 1 g/cm 3 down to 3. 51 g/cm 3, while the hardness increased systematically from 43 to 117 HV by milling duration. After the secondary processing step by subsequent heat treatment up to 850 oC, the powder constituent were transform into a new inter-metallic phase of a dominant TiAl 3. When the heating temperature was raised to 1000 oC, it transformed into an inter-metallic mixtures varying from TiAl 3, γ-TiAl and α 2 -Ti 3 Al. The dual phase γ-TiAl + α 2 -Ti 3 Al were obtained in powder milled for 80 and 100 h. A remarkable increased in hardness as high as 622 HV were obtained, while the density values were around 3. 7 – 3. 9 g/cm 3.
