Foreign aid as an instrument of foreign policy is a fundamental question for bilateral aid donors. However, {{because of the lack of}} complete data, the study of the People's Republic of China's foreign aid policy has encountered many difficulties. Nevertheless, this study has been able to show the connection between Peking's foreign policy and its foreign aid policy. This study collects and analyzes Peking's foreign aid data from 1953 to 1989 in order to investigate Peking's foreign aid policy. In the internal dimension, it attempts to discover the relationships between the PRC's annual amount of <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> and its domestic political and economic development. In the external dimension, it assumes that there is a positive correlation between Peking's foreign aid and its foreign policy. A qualitative analysis is used to discuss the internal determinants of the PRC's annual aid amount. Two explanatory variables, political conflict and economic development, are examined. A regression analysis is adopted to investigate the external determinants of the PRC's selection of aid recipients and of Peking's aid amount to individual aid recipients, with the examination of twelve and twenty explanatory variables, respectively. The research findings show that the PRC's annual <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> is influenced by domestic political conflict before 1976, and by domestic economic policies after 1976. The findings also indicate that Peking's foreign aid distribution is a useful indicator of foreign policy. The PRC's foreign aid policy is based mainly upon its motivation in pursuit of foreign policy goals. The change of foreign policy goals in four different periods had an impact on Peking's selection of its aid recipients and on its geographical aid distribution...|$|R

50|$|The Soviet Union {{and other}} members of Comecon {{increased}} their <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> as their own planning became more closely coordinated with Vietnam's following Hanoi's entry into Comecon in June 1978. Soviet economic aid in 1978, estimated at between US$0.7 and 1.0 billion, was already higher than Western assistance. By 1982 it had increased to more than US$1 billion annually, close to US$3 million per day, and it remained at this level through the mid-1980s. The Soviet Union and other Comecon countries provided aid in all categories—project assistance, technical training, price subsidies, loans, and trade credits. Soviet publications emphasized the importance of project assistance to Vietnam's economic recovery, but about 75 percent of the value of aid disbursed during the Third Five-Year Plan was used to finance Vietnam's bilateral trade deficit with the Soviet Union, which averaged about US$896 million a year. Trade subsidies in the form of reduced prices for Soviet oil also declined sharply in the early 1980s as the Soviet Union brought Vietnam into the Comecon oil-pricing system based on world market values.|$|E
50|$|Closer {{linkages}} between trade and general economic planning in the 1980s had mixed effects. Fluctuating commodities prices {{at home and}} market-oriented trade with, and investment from, Western countries were too uncertain to plan. Consequently, the Second Five-Year Plan was crippled when hoped-for Western investment failed to materialize. The joint planning approach was designed to enable Vietnam to minimize risk because it could count on stable supplies of important resources and equipment at concessionary prices, especially from the Soviet Union. Any delays or bottlenecks in the plans or <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> of Comecon countries, however, could delay or disrupt Vietnam's planning effort. In the early 1980s, for example, announcement of the Third Five-Year Plan was delayed until the Fifth National Party Congress of March 1982 while Vietnam waited for the Soviet Union to confirm its aid commitment. Similarly, Vietnam in the mid-1980s endured first reduction, then elimination of Soviet price subsidies for purchases of Soviet oil. The reductions {{were in accordance with}} the then general Soviet practice of avoiding oil price subsidies in order to keep Comecon oil prices close to those of the world market. The volume of Vietnamese trade suffered increasingly from some of the recurring problems that troubled planners in other Comecon countries during this period, including overly optimistic targets, problems of regionalism, priorities often driven by ideology, and chronic shortages of domestically produced raw materials and industrial commodities. By 1987 observers had concluded that, despite Vietnam's financial ties with Comecon, increased investment and trade from Western countries and other non-Comecon sources would be required for a general Vietnamese economic recovery (following Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia in late 1978, numerous Western and regional aid donors had withdrawn their support and imposed a trade boycott).|$|E

5000|$|Upon their 'discovery', Foreign Secretary William Hague {{requested}} Anthony Cary, {{a former}} British High Commissioner to Canada, {{to conduct an}} internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request. Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows: As British dependent territories came to independence decisions {{had to be taken}} about which papers to destroy, which to leave for successor administrations, and which to ship back to the UK. The general rule, as set out in a Colonial Office guidance telegram of 3 May 1961 on the 'disposal of classified records and accountable documents', was the successor Governments should not be given papers which:* might embarrass HMG or other Governments;* might embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers;* might compromise sources of intelligence information; or* might be used unethically by Ministers in the successor GovernmentIn addition [...] "There would be little object in handing over documents which would patently be of no value to the successor Government". A great many documents were destroyed on this basis, but others were returned to the UK. These became the so-called 'migrated archives', eventually totalling around 8,800 files. [...] Britain does not stand alone in facing such colonial legacies. Despite a public apology made in 2004 and the pledge of increased <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> to Namibia, the German Government still faces claims from the Herero peoples over a genocide inflicted in 1904. The Italians, too, are entangled in claims from their occupation of Libya. Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than the Germans, issuing an apology and promising a reparations payment of $5 billion.The British will look toward the German and not the Italian model in handling the Mau Mau case. An apology should be issued to Kenya, and if it was to be given with a pledge of development assistance, then this might help to lay the ghosts of the past.This should happen, but is it likely? It would imply an admission that torture had taken place under British rule in Kenya. We are making fools of ourselves by denying this. It is time to face up. —Professor David Anderson, June 2009 Though sympathetic to the FCO, Cary's report nonetheless judged that despite the involvement of relatively junior staff, who had been genuinely ignorant about the contents of the migrated archives, there were more knowledgeable staff who had not been. Conveniently, in 2006, after the FoI requests came in, the fifty-year-old migrated archives were relocated to the section for [...] "FCO material of between 3 and 30 years old".|$|E

Fitting a Bayesian linear regression model the empirical analysis finds that there is no strong correlation between changes in lagged <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> and changes in conflict intensity. Looking at the extensive margin the results do show that fungible aid is correlated with increased conflict risk, in line with rent-seeking behaviour, but the estimated magnitude of the coefficient is very small.

The World Bank primarily focused on economic aspects of governance in the 1980 s, and progressively moved to its political dimensions towards the end of 1990 s.

Bibliometric methods are used to evaluate the role of the Bank as a producer of knowledge on this specific issue. The potential influence of the World Bank’s main governance indicators: Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) and Doing Business, is depicted through what donors claim when allocating aid, and beyond rhetoric, through what correlations suggest. For each of the main international donors, cross-sectional econometric regressions are run on large samples of developing countries (2005 - 2008).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is compiled {{of three}} chapters {{in determining the}} effect of bilateral foreign assistance on the economy of Pakistan. The effect of foreign assistance will be {{measured in terms of}} public expenditure and revenue. The factors associated in the provision of <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> and disbursements, and the effect of bilateral assistance on the production efficiency of Pakistan. Chapter 1 uses an aid disaggregation approach to examine the impact of different types of bilateral donors on the fiscal sector of Pakistan, an important aid recipient in recent years. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the impact of bilateral aid on the economy of Pakistan, from the four largest donors, which include the USA, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Time series data for the period 1972 - 2010 were analyzed along with an estimation of a fiscal response model following Mavrotas (2005) that combines both aid disaggregation in terms of types of aid and the treatment of endogeneity. The empirical estimation of the structural equations and reduced form equations, using nonlinear three stage least squares estimation clearly suggests the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues. Since different bilateral donors have different effects on key fiscal variables, an impact could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. While aid from Japan increases public investment, aid from the USA, the UK, and Germany appears to cause a reduction in public investment. Similarly, aid from Japan reduces public consumption, but the aid from other donors causes an increase in public consumption. In regards to tax revenue, the aid flows from the USA, the UK and Germany leads to a reduction in tax revenue, but aid flow from Japan increases tax revenue. Chapter 2 investigates the relation between aid disbursements and <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> from the fourteen largest donors to Pakistan, and determine the factor that effects commitments and the disbursements. The time series data was employed for the period 1972 - 2010. The estimation of the model through fixed effect approach and two stage least squares approach showed that aid disbursements, aid commitment from donors to African countries, and Pakistan 2 ̆ 7 s membership at the United Nations Security Council effects <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> positively and significantly. But, the inverse relation existed between GDP per capita of Pakistan and <b>aid</b> <b>commitments.</b> Similarly, <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> relation with the aid disbursements was positive and significant. The war in Afghanistan during any time between 1972 - 2010 increases the aid disbursement to Pakistan. It was also determined that if the level of primary education increases, the aid disbursement to Pakistan decreases. The results also showed that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid disbursements to Pakistan reduces. Chapter 3 focus is to see the impact of different bilateral donors on the production inefficiency of the Pakistan. To empirically estimate the effect of bilateral aid heterogeneity on production inefficiency, we use the time series data for Pakistan for the period 1972 - 2010. The stochastic frontier analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood estimation. The results determined that the aid from the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany tends to increase production efficiency of Pakistan. However on the contrary aid from Japan tends to decrease production efficiency. It was also concluded from the results that foreign direct investment and public investment also increases production efficiency. But, the relation between human capital and production efficiency was negative. Also, the results indicated that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid flows from the USA and UK reduces production efficiency...|$|E
