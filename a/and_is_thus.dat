5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> not typeable.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{bromides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Silver bromide is very insoluble in water <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> often used as a qualitative test for bromine.|$|E

5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most difficult climbs in the Philippines, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton's Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth — the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia — was found in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled cardiac TnI in the cytoplasm. Cardiac TnI is exclusively expressed in the myocardium <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a highly specific diagnostic marker for cardiac muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for myocardial infarction. An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically ill patients in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E

5|$|The second {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} the alkali metals {{is much higher than}} the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> difficult to remove.|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it was framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), it {{is confined to}} Iran, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. The population has declined sharply since the mid-1970s. As of 2012, only two captive individuals are known.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, {{is both a}} monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill. This is {{explained}} by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it sees them as the same being <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> bound to protect both from harm. Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
