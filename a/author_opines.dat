40|$|FLOW EXPERIENCE IN VIDEOGAME GENRES ABSTRACT: The thesis Flow {{experience}} in videogame genres {{focuses on the}} critical dialogue with Csikszentmihalyi's concept of the flow phenomenon. The flow is a standard term for the optimal mental state during playing videogames. The author of this text discusses the original conception of flow as a universal state in all types of activities. He acknowledges a high probability of various ways of experiencing that occurs in relation to different genres and types of activities. With help of qualitative research inspired by the narrative methodology based on eight interviews with videogame journalists, he aims to present a revised dimensional model of flow experience. This thesis indicates three basic types of flow - climax, ilinx and ludic trance - that can be examined {{on the basis of}} the ten dimensions of flow (interactivity, intentionality, challenge, exploration, time urgency of executive operations, attention, level of consciousness, experience of power, source of stimul ation and value). The <b>author</b> <b>opines</b> that the revised model of flow is the first step towards a deeper understanding of the diversity of involvement in videogaming which can serve a further research of the optimal experience and categorization of playing styles corresponding with these three different [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Growth in {{the mobile}} phone {{market has been}} exponential. Mobile phones have become {{warehouses}} of information and utility. This ability to store a variety of information, has made the mobile device vulnerable to theft. Mobile device manufacturers {{are now on the}} hunt for new and innovative ways to keep the device and the data that resides within it safe. A viable authentication mechanism is the biometric voice verification technique. This research seeks to rate the performance of a proprietary voice verification algorithm using an experimental approach. The algorithm under investigation is the Text-dependent Speaker Recognition System 1. 0. This algorithm uses Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) - derived cepstral coefficients and their regression coefficients to verify the speaker's templates. The research included conducting an experiment on 5, 625 voice samples of 25 users. It has been proved in this research that the Text-dependent Speaker Recognition System 1. 0 algorithm offers a high level of accuracy. The average false acceptance rate (FAR) for the research corpus was 0. 01 and the false rejection rate (FRR) was 0. 000167. Due to the significant amount of time that was consumed in the verification process and the overhead of pre-processing the voice samples, this <b>author</b> <b>opines</b> that in its current state, the algorithm does not have the potential to be deployed in commercial and domestic applications...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{the first in a series}} of {{publications}} dealing with the problem of wider leadership in the Orthodox Church. The opposing positions of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Church of Constantinople in this regard have emerged during animated discussions. This divergence begs for a reassessment of already existing models of leadership, which obviously cannot serve as a basis for the agreement, and for a search to discover new approaches. The author studies the way in which the Patriarchate of Constantinople succeeded in theorizing the idea of a universal primacy and the concept’s theological foundations. The <b>author</b> <b>opines</b> that contemporary scholars do not thoroughly assess the significance of the historical evolution of the doctrine. Neither do they give sufficient thought to a careful study of the process surrounding the debates on the primacy. Careful study of both these issues would explain current contradictions and offer a way of solving the contemporary crisis. The article highlights those factors which influenced the Patriarchate of Constantinople during the nineteen-twenties of the last century to significantly alter its ecclesiastical politics. Sources indicate that Constantinople was swayed by the Greek national political program and that many of its actions were not determined exclusively by ecclesiastical concerns. Theorizing the position of Constantinople as the center of world-wide Orthodoxy during these years stemmed from the strategy of preserving the headquarters of the Patriarchate on Turkish soil. The theory of the primacy in the Orthodox Church likewise served as a way to increase the canonical territory of the Patriarchate, not least since the Patriarchate had lost significant funding for its continued existence...|$|E
