60|$|Standing {{some two}} {{miles out of}} Reigate is the village of Crowswood, a quiet place and fairly well to do, thanks in no small degree to Squire Thorndyke, who owned {{the whole of the}} parish, and by whom and his tenants the greater portion of the village were employed. Greatly had the closing of the Manor House, after the death of old Squire Thorndyke, been felt. There were no more jellies, soups, and other comforts to be looked for in time of sickness, no <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> when the {{breadwinner}} was sick or disabled, no check to the drunkards, whom the knowledge that they would be turned out of their cottage at a week's notice kept in some sort of order. When, therefore, after ten years of absence of all government, John Thorndyke, {{after the death of his}} brother, the Colonel, came down and took possession, he found the place sadly changed from what it had been when he had left it twenty years before. His first act was to dismiss Newman; who, completely unchecked, had, he found, been sadly mismanaging affairs. It was not long, however, before his hand made itself felt. Two out of the three public houses were shut up in six months, a score of their habitual frequenters had, weeks before, been turned out of their houses, an order had been issued that unless a cottage was kept in good order and the garden bright and blooming with flowers in the summer a fresh tenant would be found for it. Every child must be sent to the village school; the Squire was ready to do what there was to be done in the way of thatching and whitewashing, repairing palings and painting doors and windows, but, as he told the people, the village had to be kept clean and decent, and anyone who would not conform to the rules was at liberty to leave without a day's notice.|$|E

Gwatkin broke up the manor of Fursdon in 1813-4. He also sold Advent in 1814, to Allen Searell. In 1816, the Rev.

40|$|Starting from {{a case of}} the {{jurisprudence}} of the Cluj Court of Appeal, {{this study}} probes into the different aspects of the contract of lease for lands pertaining to the State’s private domain (that is, under the Local Council’s management) through which the lessees, in consideration of certain special criteria, procure the right to employ the land for a fixed term of 99 years, in order to build individual housing units. The fundamental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is whether the lesser can one-sidedly increase the rent due to the fact that a third party buyer, to whom the initial lessee sold the building, failed to comply with the special conditions that led to the initial <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent.</b> It is reasonable to assume that such a decision would be illegal taking into account that the lease contract has a civil nature and not an administrative one (as a result the lesser cannot unilaterally alter the contract) and, on the other hand, the fact that this type of contract does not retain its intuitu personae nature throughout its period of enforcement (considering the provisions under art. 41 of Law no. 50 / 1991 on construction permits), even though that attribute was essential at the moment when the contract was concluded. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} {{was a period}} of {{extensive}} change in English rural society, in terms of both agriculture itself and the rural economy as a whole. Northamptonshire in this period, whilst remaining a predominantly rural county, underwent a significant transformation. This transformation, along with an extensive quantity of surviving data, has made nineteenth-century Northamptonshire a subject of great interest to historians. Within this context this study examines the rural rental economy in Northamptonshire across the period 1801 - 1881 ??? with particular focus on the recession years 1815 - 1831 ??? and is centred on the factors affecting the setting and payment <b>of</b> <b>rents.</b> Central to the study is a wealth of rental data, primarily extrapolated from estate account books. This is used to examine how the rental economy operated on landed estates {{within the context of the}} wider economy and prevailing agricultural prices. The importance of the relative roles of landowners, stewards and tenants in setting rents, extracting payments and negotiating reductions are the central focus, with investment in the land and changes in the wider economy also being examined in terms of their effect on the rental economy. The study began life as an examination of the moral economy of the landed estate but developed into an analysis of rental data, particularly estate accounts, and a study of the rental economy. The account books themselves provide evidence of the rental economy on the landed estate in the nineteenth century but do have their limitations. Whilst the books provide figures for agreed <b>rents,</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> and <b>abatements</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent,</b> plus various memoranda, they do not provide acreages for holdings or distinguish types of holding. As a result a study of agreed and paid rents has been undertaken but figures for rent per acre and differences by type of farming cannot be identified. Instead, the study focuses on the flexibility of the rental economy and the importance <b>of</b> arrears and <b>abatements</b> in enabling the long-term survival of the landed income in Northamptonshire. The study examines accounts and rental data in terms <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> levels, the payment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> and both temporary abatements and permanent rent reductions. The accounts evidence is supplemented by a number of other sources including landlord and estate correspondence plus annotations and memoranda in the account books themselves. The data is then placed in wider context (particularly that of Turner, Beckett and Afton???s 1997 study Agricultural Rent in England, 1690 - 1914) and examined in depth in terms of both what it tells us about the landed estate in Northamptonshire and the strengths and limitations of the accounts data...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the last}} day of March 1887, the {{government}} felt the necessity of introducing a measure based on facts that they had disputed, and on principles that they had repudiated. Leaseholders were admitted, some hundred thousand of them. That is, the more solemn of the forms of agrarian contract were set aside. Other provisions we may pass over. But this was not the bill to which the report of the Commission pointed. The pith of that report was the revision and <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> judicial <b>rents,</b> and from the new bill this vital point was omitted. It could hardly have been otherwise after a curt declaration made by the prime minister in the previous August. “We do not contemplate any revision of judicial rents,” he said—immediately, by the way, after appointing a commission {{to find out what it}} was that they ought to contemplate. “We do not think it would be honest in the first place, and we think it would be exceedingly inexpedient.”(231) He now repeated that to interfere with judicial rents because prices had fallen, would be to “lay your axe to the root of the fabric of civilised society.”(232) Before the bill was introduced, Mr. Balfour, who had gone to the Irish office on the retirement of Sir M. H. Beach in the month of March, proclaimed in language even more fervid, that it would be folly and madness to break these solemn contracts.(233) ...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, the world’s {{buildings}} {{accounted for}} approximately 19 % of all greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions stem {{from both the}} construction and operation of buildings. In recent years the carbon efficiency of energy sources and energy efficiency of new buildings has been improved in Sweden. Therefore, embodied emissions accounts for an increasing share {{of the life cycle}} emissions of new buildings. This study aims to asses the cost effectiveness in <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> embodied emissions. This was done by assessing the embodied emissions of a case building and several conventional design measures along with the implication on production cost. It was found that many of the measures enabled cost effective carbon abatement. Embodied emissions could be reduced by 15 % using cost neutral or nearly cost neutral measures. Abatements up to 18 % were found cost effective in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Abatements up to 24 % were possible with minor increases in total production cost (0. 22 %) even though some of the individual measures were found expensive in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors.
