Still a teenager at the time, he was put on trial in a Norwegian court for violating Norwegian Criminal Code section 145, and faced a possible jail sentence of two years and large fines, but was acquitted of all charges in early 2003.

50|$|French Minister of Justice Dominique Perben had {{stated that}} such unions would be legally void, {{and called for}} {{judicial}} intervention to halt the ceremony.

On 19 April 2005, the Appeals Court of Bordeaux upheld the ruling. On 14 March 2007, the Court of Cassation turned down Charpentier and Chapin's appeal.
