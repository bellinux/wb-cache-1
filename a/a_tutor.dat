5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as <b>a</b> <b>tutor</b> in his place. He enjoyed Adams as <b>a</b> <b>tutor,</b> but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between <b>a</b> <b>tutor’s</b> advice and <b>a</b> student’s questionings, and the way in which it develops a student’s self-regulation skill. Firstly we offer that <b>a</b> <b>tutor’s</b> advice is one component that trains a student’s self-regulation skill. Through analysis of interactive learning opportunities between academic departments, we discovered that <b>a</b> <b>tutor’s</b> advice transformed <b>a</b> student’s questionings. This transformation indicates an appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill. We propose a model for further development of a student’s self-regulation skill, which is based on the appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} of programming {{resources on the}} Internet, such as programming problems on online judge systems and program codes that solve these problems. Although these resources are valuable for students to practice programming, they are not effectively organized to facilitate students learning. Students and teachers may both hope that all these programming resources are organized as <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> sequence. For this purpose, an approach {{which is based on}} neural computing is proposed here to organize the programming resources automatically into <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> sequence. 2456 source codes were mined in our experiment, resulting in 97 mainstream solutions to 105 programming problems, respectively. These mainstream solutions were sorted by their complexities to form <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> sequence which organizes the problems together with their program codes from easy to difficult...|$|R

5|$|After basic {{education}} in Greek with <b>a</b> <b>tutor</b> known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in Romanian Cyrillic (reportedly {{by studying the}} Alexander Romance {{with the help of}} his father's Oltenian servants). He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by Caragea's plague). After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil of the Orthodox monk Naum Râmniceanu; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at Schitu Măgureanu, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the Saint Sava School, where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where he served as <b>a</b> <b>tutor</b> for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored {{a plan for a}} European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{investigates the}} effects of a robot’s “on-line ” {{feedback}} during <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> situation with <b>a</b> human <b>tutor.</b> Analysis is based on a study conducted with an iCub robot that autonomously generates its feedback (gaze, pointing gesture) based on the system’s perception of the tutor’s actions using the idea of reciprocity of actions. Sequential micro-analysis of two opposite cases reveals how the robot’s behavior (responsive vs. non-responsive) pro-actively shapes the tutor’s conduct and thus co-produces {{the way in which it}} is being <b>tutored.</b> <b>A</b> dialogic and <b>a</b> monologic <b>tutoring</b> style are distinguished. The first 20 seconds of an encounter are found to shape the user’s perception and expectations of the system’s competences and lead to <b>a</b> relatively stable <b>tutoring</b> style even if the robot’s reactivity and appropriateness of feedback changes.

5|$|He {{spent most}} of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. His {{experiences}} in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by <b>a</b> <b>tutor.</b> He did his share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.|$|E
5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as <b>a</b> <b>tutor</b> in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E

At the college, later to become the University of Canterbury, he acquired a reputation for his energy and wit. In his leisure time, he often went climbing in the Southern Alps.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{have created}} <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> architecture, D 2 P (Declarative to Procedural), based on ACT-R’s theory of {{knowledge}} and learning for declarative and procedural memory. D 2 P also draws on general theories of learning and a recent review by Kim, Ritter, and Koubek (in press). D 2 P provides multimedia instruction pages followed by questions, video, and/or simulations to test and proceduralise the declarative knowledge. It is implemented in XML, XML-based tools, Java, and COTS tools. We have created two D 2 P tutors. We have evaluated one, {{and it has a}} 1. 48 effect size on learning how much to lead. We have found that modern tools help create <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> system; creating <b>a</b> <b>tutoring</b> architecture requires more than just the system (such as manuals and example systems); and the next steps are to test the theory of learning and use a cognitive architecture-based knowledge model to make the system adaptive. 1...|$|R

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as <b>a</b> <b>tutor</b> of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
