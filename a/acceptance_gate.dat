This is solved via an <b>acceptance</b> <b>gate</b> approach (similar to nearest neighbor), {{in which the}} incoming single-DOA estimation is compared to the estimated DOA of all pre-existing tracks (the manner in which these are estimated is explained in the ‘Track update’ step). The single-DOA estimation is associated to its nearest track, only if the angular distance between them is below a pre-specified threshold (the same threshold used for redundancy check in the ITD estimation). If no track is within that threshold, a new track is spawned with only the single-DOA estimation associated to it.|$|E

The Conference's {{web site}} is located at [URL] {{as a way of}} life because of its long {{existence}} and wide adoption, the urban and social implications of the estate-type residential organization in Hong Kong have been seldom questioned. This paper aims to explain this lack of criticism on residential gatedness at local level by comparing the Hong Kong case with international prototypes. This paper will initially compare the proliferation of gated communities in Hong Kong and other cities, focusing on the underlying social processes. It will then compare the characteristics of the residential enclaves, focusing on features which are contentious in the gated community literature: security, privatization and governance of public space, socio-spatial segregation, community development, and accessibility to public and social services. Finally, it will compare the institutional contexts and processes shaping diversified socio-spatial outcomes as a way of explaining for the strong <b>acceptance</b> of <b>gated</b> communities in Hong Kong. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Cycle length {{windowing}} {{is gaining}} increasing <b>acceptance</b> in <b>gated</b> blood pool imaging {{of patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF). The goals of this study were: to assess differences of ejection fraction (EF) in AF with and without windowing and to determine how EF varied with cycle length in patients with AF. Twenty patients with AF were prospectively studied by gated blood pool imaging, with simultaneous collection in each patient of 5 – 7 studies with cycle length windows spanning the cycle length histogram. Each window accepted beats of only a narrow range of cycle lengths. EF was determined {{for each of the}} narrow cycle length windows {{as well as for the}} entire gated blood pool study without cycle length windowing. For every patient an average of the windowed EFs was compared with the non-windowed EF. EF values were similar (mean windowed: 46. 6; non-windowed: 45. 5; P = 0. 16), and there was a good correlation between the two techniques (r = 0. 97). The data were then examined for a relationship of EF with cycle length. The difference from average windowed EF (ΔEF) was calculated for each window and plotted vs. the cycle length of the center of each window. No predictable linear or nonlinear relationship of ΔEF with window position was observed. Lack of predictable variation of EF with cycle length is likely due to lack of a predictable amount of ventricular filling for a given cycle length, as the amount of diastolic filling in AF depends on the random cycle length of the preceding beat. In summary, windowing in AF does not provide a clinically significant difference in EF determination. If cycle length windowing is used, the exact location of the window is not critical...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to assess the}} impact of {{respiratory}} motion and to compare methods for suppression of respiratory motion artifacts in 4 D Flow MRI. Methods: A numerical 3 D aorta phantom was designed based on an aorta velocity field obtained by computational fluid mechanics. Motion-distorted 4 D Flow MRI measurements were simulated and several different motion-suppression techniques were evaluated: <b>Gating</b> with fixed <b>acceptance</b> window size, <b>gating</b> with different window sizes in inner and outer kspace, and k-space reordering. Additionally, different spatial resolutions were simulated. Results: Respiratory motion reduced the image quality. All motion-suppression techniques improved the data quality. Flow rate errors of up to 30 % without gating could be reduced to less than 2. 5 % with the most successful motion suppression methods. Weighted gating and gating combined with kspace reordering were advantageous compared with conventional fixed-window gating. Spatial resolutions finer than the amount of accepted motion did not lead to improved results. Conclusion: Respiratory motion affects 4 D Flow MRI data. Several different motion suppression techniques exist that are capable of reducing the errors associated with respiratory motion. Spatial resolutions finer than the degree of accepted respiratory motion do not result in improved data quality. (C) 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
