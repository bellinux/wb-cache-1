5000|$|The {{system could}} be {{operated}} at four frequencies between 2,700 and 2,800 MHz (10-11 cm wavelength), sending out 300 kW pulses of 0.8 microseconds in duration with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1,707 pulses per second. It could detect bomber-sized targets at about 40 miles range, and was generally able to automatically track them at about 18 miles. Accuracy within this range was 25 yards in range, and 0.06 degrees (1 mil) in <b>antenna</b> <b>bearing</b> angle (See Table [...] "SCR-584 Technical Characteristics"). Because the electrical beam width was 4 degrees (to the -3db or half-power points), the target would be smeared across {{a portion of a}} cylinder, so as to be wider in bearing than in range (i.e., on the order of 4 degrees, rather than 0.06 degrees implied by the mechanical pointing accuracy), for distant targets. Range information was displayed on two [...] "J-scopes", similar to the more common A-line display, but arranged in a radial pattern timed to the return delay. One scope was used for coarse range, the other for fine.|$|E

30|$|Regardless of {{the radio}} access technology, {{cellular}} network planning is divided into core network planning and radio access network (RAN) planning. While the former is often only a dimensioning process, the latter entails the definition of RAN parameter settings that can be deployed in the roll-out stage. These parameters include not only physical parameters (e.g., site positions, <b>antenna</b> <b>bearings,</b> or power amplifier limits) but also logical parameters in radio resource management (RRM) algorithms [3 - 5]. In the past, due {{to the complexity of}} finding optimal settings for each specific scenario, vendors have provided operators with safe recommended values that should work reasonably well in most cases. Thus, the flexibility given by network parameters has not been fully exploited. To solve this situation, an effort has been made in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) long term evolution (LTE) standard to define the requirements for automating and improving network planning [6]. Likewise, automatic (or self-) planning has been identified by the industry as a key process in self-organizing networks (SON) [7 - 9].|$|R

These parametric studies use a NASTRAN pedestal structural model to determine the deflections under the hydrostatic bearing pad.

For the future 64 -meter to 70 -meter antenna extension and for the 2. 2 -meter (86 -in.) haunch concrete replacement cases, safe oil film thickness (greater than 0. 13 mm (0. 005 in.) at the corners of the pad) are predicted.

25|$|For {{detecting}} the targets, GL was largely ineffective. From a mechanical standpoint, {{the need to}} swing the entire system around for tracking presented a major problem. A more serious limitation was the displays themselves, which showed {{only a small portion}} of the sky in the range display, and a single on-target/off-target indication in bearing. Although it might be possible to swing the <b>antenna</b> in <b>bearing</b> to find a target, the direction was accurate to only 20 degrees, enough to keep the antennas aligned with the target, but of little use directing optical instruments onto a target, especially at night. Additionally, the bearing display only showed whether the antennas were aligned or not, but not to which side or the other the target lay if it was mis-aligned, requiring more work to determine which direction to turn the antenna for tracking.|$|R

Due to the research results the mobile ultra-wideband antenna system was suggested. Its elements are new ultra-wideband emitters, which can belong to disco-cone antenna class. Ultra-wideband emitters are provided by foil form of the antenna element. The round function of the AS element, obtained by theoretical modeling and confirmed by practical experiments, has an exponential form. The fifth degree polynomial provides the required accuracy approximation. The combination of the radiator elements, their alignment and soldering is carried out by means of specially designed equipment. Checking of the transmitter parameter is done by proportional constant measuring of standing wave, which takes the meaning less than three values in the frequency range from 95 to 900 MHz. This satisfies the requirements of the ultra-wideband <b>antenna</b> direction <b>bearing</b> finder sources of radio signals. The basic parameters and design features of AS are presented...|$|R

The tests revealed a different sensitivity of the wingless and winged morphs of Schizaphis graminum towards the fungal cultures applied. Indeed, some isolates proved to be repellent for the winged but not for the wingless morphs, suggesting that the capability to interact with fungal metabolites is associated with the secondary rhinaria that are located on the antenna of the winged and absent on the wingless morphs.

40|$|Many {{arthropods}} capture odorant molecules {{from the}} environment using <b>antennae</b> or antennules <b>bearing</b> arrays of chemo-sensory hairs. The penetration of odorant-carrying water or air into the spaces between these chemosensory hairs depends on {{the speed at which}} they are moved through the surrounding fluid. Therefore, antennule flicking by crustaceans and wing fanning by insects can have a profound impact on the odorant encounter rates of the chemosensory sensilla they bear; flicking and fanning are examples of sniffing. Odors are dispersed in the environment by turbulent wind or water currents. On the scale of an antenna or antennule, an odor plume is not a diffuse cloud but rather is a series of fine filaments of scent swirling in odor-free water. The spatiotemporal pattern of these filaments depends on distance from the odor source. The physical interaction of a hair-bearing arthropod antennule with the surrounding fluid affects the temporal patterns of odor concentration an animal intercepts when it sniffs in a turbulent odor plume...|$|R
40|$|DNA barcoding {{revealed}} four well-supported clades among amphipod specimens that keyed out to Epimeria georgiana Schellenberg, 1931, three clades with specimens {{from the}} southern Scotia Arc and one clade with specimens from the Weddell Sea.

High magnification (500 - 2, 000 fold) revealed features such as comb-scales on the first <b>antenna</b> and trich <b>bearing</b> pits on the fourth coxal plate to be similar for all specimens in the four clades. Consistent microstructure character differences in the Weddell Sea specimens combined with high genetic distances (COI divergence> 20 %) allowed the description of Epimeria angelikae, a species new to science.

40|$|GNSS {{systems are}} a well {{established}} technique for guiding machines or the machine’s operator along predefined routes. Such GNSS applications {{have been successfully}} integrated into the design of construction machines and farming equipment. While a GNSS-equipped machine moves straight ahead conventional GNSS systems with only one antenna show good performance. However, the system reaches its limits when the machine turns on its own axis, such as an excavator does. This causes the GNSS receiver to be unable to determine its bearing, as a compass could do. A common single-antenna GNSS receiver can only estimate its moving direction (heading) using previous positions. Since a turn around its own axis {{does not change the}} coordinates, but changes the orientation of the machine, the orientation can not be calculated by this means. A common solution to this problem is the implementation of two GNSS antennas. Two <b>antennas</b> allow the <b>bearing</b> of the baseline between the antennas to be defined. A new approach with only one antenna required is under development at the ETH Zurich. This new system uses the satellite positions as a reference for orientation. For that purpose the direction of each satellite’s signal has to be known in relation to the antenna. In order to obtain orientation the signal strength of each satellite is measured. A well defined shading of the received signals allows estimating the required orientation. After full implementation of our approach, the second GNSS antenna found on most construction machines will not be required anymore...|$|R
40|$|The Slotted Waveguide Antennas Stiffened Structure (SWASS) {{concept is}} a {{conformal}} load <b>bearing</b> <b>antenna</b> structure {{designed by a}} joint Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) team. In SWASS the top-hat cross-section stiffeners that are commonly used to reinforce thin aircraft skins (or blade stiffeners in sandwich panels) double as microwave waveguides. Slots machined through the outer skin of the stiffened panel and into these waveguides may operate as slotted waveguide antenna arrays. The SWASS concept may therefore {{be integrated into the}} airframe with very little weight and drag penalty compared to conventional protruding aircraft antennas. However the structural impact of the slot and the orientation of the stiffeners have limited the real-world application of the SWASS concept. This work has investigated electromagnetic metamaterials as one approach to overcome these limitations. Metamaterials are constructed by embedding sub-wavelength inclusions into a host medium to form a one, two or three dimensional volume. These inclusions act analogous to artificial molecules that can be engineered to produce the desired bulk material response. In this regard, the metamaterial gains its properties from its structure rather than from its composition. Unfortunately the narrow bandwidth and high loss inherent to existing metamaterial designs has limited their widespread use amongst the engineering community. This work tackled the bandwidth limitation by incorporating varactors in the unit cell for electronic control of the fields within the metamaterial volume. This thesis has demonstrated a new metamaterial design that exhibits a negative refractive index capable of being tuned across the entire C microwave band (nominally 4. 0 GHz to 8. 0 GHz). The strong localised electromagnetic fields identified in the metamaterial unit cell were used to enhance the gain of a sub-resonant length slot. This effectively decoupled the mechanical and electromagnetic design limitations that plagued the SWASS concept. Furthermore, the ability to tune the propagating mode inspired {{the development of a new}} coaxial composite right/left-handed transmission line for the purpose of electronic beam steering in the SWASS. This has expanded the SWASS concept to applications where the stiffener orientation was previously not conducive to the desired antenna scan plane. Finally, metamaterials have the potential to revolutionise the way we manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum. It is hoped that this work takes one small step toward bridging the gap between the science of metamaterials and the real-world engineering application of their unique properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{new family}} Cristacoxidae is {{proposed}} {{to accommodate the}} monotypic genera Cristacoxa gen. nov., Noodtorthopsyllus Lang (ex Canthocamptidae) and Cubanocleta Petkovski (ex Laophontidae). Cristacoxa petkovskii gen. et spec. nov. is described {{on the basis of}} a single male collected from coralline sand of Bonaire, West Indies. N. psammophilus Noodt and C. noodti Petkovski are redescribed and refigured on the basis of new material from the Galápagos (Isla Santa Cruz), the West Indian Islands (Curaçao, Klein Curaçao, Bonaire) and the Canary Islands (El Hierro, Tenerife). The new family is characterised by the presence of an outer spinous process on the first antennular segment, the absence of the antennary exopod, the uniramous mandibular palp, the presence of conspicuous cristae on the precoxa and coxa of leg 1 and the elongation of the apical exopodal spines of P 2 to P 4. The Cristacoxidae are unique in having an equal number of setae/spines on the P 5 in both sexes. Examination of the ontogeny of this leg in males and females of Orthopsyllus spec. gives strong evidence that the cristacoxid P 5 has undergone neotenous evolution. Males of Cristacoxidae are readily recognisable by their extremely long spermatophores. The new family is allocated to the superfamily Laophontoidea T. Scott, together with the Laophontidae T. Scott, the Laophontopsidae Huys & Willems, the Orthopsyllidae Huys and the Adenopleurellidae Huys. A phylogenetic analysis of the relationships within the superfamily is presented, and as a result Por’s (1986) concept of the Laophontoidea is refuted. Instead, it is concluded that the superfamily can be defined on the basis of the following apomorphies: (1) antennules with outer spinous process on segment 2; (2) <b>antenna</b> with allobasis <b>bearing</b> 1 seta; (3) antennary exopod quadrisetose; (4) P 1 exopod without inner seta on exp- 2 and 4 setae/spines on exp- 3; (5) P 1 endopod 2 -segmented with elongated enp- 1 and 2 elements on enp- 2; (6) P 2 —P 4 with 2 -segmented endopods; exp- 1 without inner seta; (7) sexual dimorphism of P 3 endopod; (8) P 6 bisetose with one member fused to somite. There is no close relationship neither with the Normanellidae Lang, nor with the Ancorabolidae T. Scott. The Laophontidae are considered the first offshoot in the evolution of the Laophontoidea because of the retention of the 8 -segmented antennule in both sexes and the ancestral seta formulae on P 2 —P 4. The other families can be assigned to two clades: the Adenopleurellidae and the Laophontopsidae-Cristacoxidae-Orthopsyllidae-grouping. The Laophontopsidae and the Cristacoxidae are sister groups because of the shared sexual dimorphism of the P 3 endopod (advanced type), and the fusion of antennular segments distal to the geniculation in the male. Emphasis is placed on the postembryonic development in the Laophontoidea of the male P 3 endopod and P 6 and on their homologies in the female. A reconstruction of the hypothetical ancestor of the Laophontoidea is presented...|$|R
