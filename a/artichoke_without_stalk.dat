The results showed that fiber and lumen diameter and  cell wall thickness of  <b>without</b> bast <b>stalk</b> fibers were greater than those of bast fibers, while bast fibers were longer. Thus, this fibers can be classified as short and medium length fibers respectively. Data showed that the Length/ Diameter ratio and Runkle ratio of the bast fibers were greater than those of <b>without</b> bast <b>stalk</b> fibers, and flexibility coefficient in <b>without</b> bast <b>stalk</b> fibers was greater. Stalk with higher diameter had less bast proportion. Oven-dried density and swelling and shrinkage values of thicker stalks were greater than those of thinner ones, but apparent and basic densities,as well as porosity in thinner stalks were higher.

40|$|The {{southern}} root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) {{is a major}} parasite {{of cotton}} in the U. S., and management tactics for this nematode attempt to minimize population levels. We compared three post-harvest practices {{for their ability to}} reduce nematode population levels in the field, thereby reducing initial nematode population for the next year's crop. The three practices tested were: 1) chemical defoliation before harvest plus cutting cotton stalks after harvest, 2) chemical defoliation plus applying a herbicide to kill plants prior to cutting the stalks, and 3) chemical defoliation <b>without</b> cutting <b>stalks.</b> Experiments were conducted in both the greenhouse and in the field. The greenhouse experiments demonstrated that M. incognita reproduction (measured as egg counts and root gall rating indices) was significantly greater when stalks were not cut. Cutting stalks plus applying herbicide to kill cotton roots did not significantly reduce nematode reproduction compared to cutting stalks alone. In field experiments, cutting stalks reduced egg populations and root galling compared to defoliation <b>without</b> <b>stalk</b> cutting. In a greenhouse bioassay which used soil from the field plots, plants grown in soil from the defoliation only treatment had greater root gall ratings and egg counts than in the stalk cutting plus herbicide treatment. Therefore, we conclude that cutting cotton stalks immediately after harvest effectively reduces M. incognita reproduction, and may lead to a lower initial population density of this nematode in the following year...|$|R
