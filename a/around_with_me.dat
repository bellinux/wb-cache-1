500|$|Lytle {{also stated}} that he was [...] "burnt out on touring" [...] and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol {{problems}} {{as a factor in}} the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was [...] "a bit of a loner", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: [...] "The main thing is not having four girlfriends to lug <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{knocked out}} most of the vision in one eye, {{perforated}} my eardrums, knocked out some front teeth. [...] I awoke in a plum tree with one arm missing below the elbow and realised I had to change my lifestyle. I think it motivated me, it awakened my intellect. [...] If it hadn't happened I probably would have left school when I was 16 and just got any sort of job, hung <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> mates ...Blacktown is that sort of environment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'd rather play <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{than any}} of the Skull and Bones or Hasty Pudding men you know? Or foreign diplomats with spade beards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{reached the}} middle of the mount [...] Up which the incarnate soul must climb, And paused for them, and looked <b>around,</b> [...] <b>With</b> <b>me</b> who walked through space and time.|$|R
5000|$|... "The guys I {{used to run}} <b>around</b> <b>with</b> tell <b>me</b> I changed, and I'm acting kind of strange; But {{they don't}} realize, that since I met you, my whole life has been re-arranged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{you always}} {{think of them as}} 'common.' They don't think of each other that way. Suppose I'd worked----Well, just suppose I'd been a Bowery bartender. Could you be loafing <b>around</b> here <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> Could you go off on a bat with Jack Ryan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, I {{know how}} you mean. And it's {{good of you to}} like beating it <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> But you sure got the exaggerated idee of me. And you'd get sick of the holes I'm likely to land in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I seldom dine in public," [...] he explained, {{flushing}} slightly. [...] "My bill-of-fare is very limited, you know, {{owing to}} my--my condition; and so I carry my food-tablets <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> wherever I go, and eat {{them in my}} own room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, you old faker," [...] he said, angrily, [...] "be on your way. I don't {{know what}} your game is, unless you want change for a bogus $40,000,000 bill. Well, I don't carry that much <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> But I do carry a pretty fair left-handed punch that you'll get if you don't move on." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the letter is for yourself alone. I {{want to ask you}} two questions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot recognise any sentiment which those <b>around</b> share <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{time may}} come, Dan. But {{for the present}} I think we have enough men for this expedition. I think you and Ralph will have enough to do <b>around</b> the ranch, <b>with</b> <b>me</b> absent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Doctor, don't {{you come}} bothering <b>around</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> that {{dictionary}} bosh. I don't do you any harm, do I? Then {{you let me}} alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said Ide. [...] "Stay with me, Dawson--that's a good fellow. Walk <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> awhile. I {{never went}} to pieces like this before, and I've had a good many hard knocks. Do {{you think you could}} hustle {{something}} {{in the way of a}} little lunch, old man? I'm afraid my nerve's too far gone to try any panhandling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And good! By the Lord Harry I {{was so good}} it hurt. My {{conscience}} got so expansive and fine-strung it lamed {{me across}} the shoulders to carry it <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Why, I even went back over my accounts and paid Sweitzer fifty quid I'd jiggered him out of in a deal in Fiji three years before. And I compounded the interest as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{not exactly}} GOT it, {{but the next}} thing to it. I've brought a petition, signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and all the teachers, and by {{more than two hundred}} other people. Now I want you, if you'll be so good, to go <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the Pacific delegation, for I want to rush this thing through and get along home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} spent it freely, right enough," [...] he {{retorted}} dryly, [...] "but whether {{he would have done}} good to everyone <b>around</b> <b>with</b> it--I doubt <b>me</b> [...] . . . to Ignácz Goldstein, perhaps [...] . . ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} you to feel it, nor would you do so long if you had other people <b>around</b> you. <b>With</b> <b>me</b> it is different. I am an old man, and cannot look for new pleasures in society. It has been the fault {{of my life to}} be too much alone. I {{do not want to see}} my {{children}} follow me in that." ...|$|R
60|$|I WAS {{so pleased}} at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look <b>around</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> some {{interest}} on the strange land that I was in.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Julien," [...] she declared, [...] "the {{thing is}} ridiculous. We have {{finished}} with all that. I am a Bohemian. I expect to walk about these streets {{when and where}} and at what hour I choose. You have business with Mr. Kendricks and I am glad of it. You certainly shall not waste your time gallivanting <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Janette and I together could defy any sort of danger." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{carrying}} a beautiful alcoholic conflagration <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> The thing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer. There was no time, in all my waking time, that I didn't want a drink. I began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only five hundred words were written. It was not long until I prefaced {{the beginning of the}} thousand words with a drink.|$|E
60|$|At times, so fuzzy do I {{get from}} so much reading, that I am glad for any diversion. When we strike the doldrums, which lie between the {{north-east}} and the south-east trades, I shall have Wada assemble my little twenty- two automatic rifle {{and try to}} learn how to shoot. I used to shoot, when I was a wee lad. I can remember dragging a shot-gun <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> over the hills. Also, I possessed an air-rifle, with which, on great occasion, I was even able to slaughter a robin.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{election}} campaign, Progressive Conservative leader John Tory stated that if elected, he would name Martel {{to conduct a}} review of current government medical and social services for children with autism, an issue which Martel had frequently championed in the legislature. In response to the statement, Hampton said [...] "I wish Mr. Tory good luck, but my wife is rather fussy about who she hangs <b>around</b> <b>with.</b> Believe <b>me,</b> I know. It took me about six years." ...|$|R
6000|$|ROBESPIERRE. [...] Myself! the steel-strong rectitude of soul [...] And poverty sublime 'mid {{circling}} virtues! [...] The giant victories, my counsels form'd, [...] Shall stalk <b>around</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> sun-glittering plumes, [...] Bidding the darts of calumny fall pointless.|$|R
60|$|Tom Hopkins weighs {{one hundred}} and ninety-eight. He gave me another somnolent grin, and fell into deeper slumber. I would have made him move about, but I {{might as well have}} tried to make Cleopatra's needle waltz <b>around</b> the room <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Tom's {{breathing}} became stertorous, and that, in connection with morphia poisoning, means danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{be engaged}} in about two minutes if you'll meet me with [...] Jack," [...] he replied. [...] "You're the best girl {{in the world and}} I'm [...] going to marry you when I get rich enough to come back and [...] build you a house to be in, I'm going out where the cattle [...] are thick as grasshoppers, and I'm going to be a cattle king [...] and then you can be a cattle queen and ride <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> on [...] our ranch, that's what they call a farm out there. Now, [...] you're my girl and you must wait for me to come back. Don't [...] you get impatient, {{sometimes}} a chap has a hard time just to [...] get a start, after that it's easy. Jack will go with me, he [...] will be my friend and share everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it! God-fearin' or revolver-fearin', {{it amounts}} to the same when you {{come down to the}} hard pan and bed-rock," [...] {{interrupted}} McGee. [...] "I ain't expectin' you to think much of my style, but I go a heap on yours, even if I can't play your game. And I sez to my wife, 'Safie'--her that trots <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> sometimes--I sez, 'Safie, I oughter know that man, and shall. And I WANT YOU to know him.' Hol' on," [...] he added quickly, as Madison rose with a flushed face and a perturbed gesture. [...] "Ye don't understand! I see wot's in your mind--don't you see? When I married my wife and brought her down here, knowin' this yer camp, I sez: 'No flirtin', no foolin', no philanderin' here, my dear! You're young and don't know the ways o' men. The first man I see you talking with, I shoot. You needn't fear, my dear, for accidents. I kin shoot all round you, under your arm, across your shoulders, over your head and between your fingers, my dear, and never start skin or fringe or ruffle. But I don't miss HIM. You sorter understand what I mean,' sez I,'so don't!' Ye noticed how my wife is respected, Mr. Wayne? Queen Victoria sittin' on her throne ain't in it with my Safie. But when I see YOU not herdin' with that cattle, never liftin' your eyes to me or Safie as we pass, never hangin' round the saloons and jokin', nor winkin', nor slingin' muddy stories about women, but prayin' and readin' Scripter stories, here along with your brother, I sez to myself, I sez, 'Sandy, ye kin take off your revolver and hang up your shot gun when HE'S around. For 'twixt HIM and your wife ain't no revolver, but the fear of God and hell and damnation and the world to come!' You understand what I mean, don't ye? Ye sorter follow my lead, eh? Ye can see what I'm shootin' round, don't ye? So I want you to come up neighborly like, and drop in to see my wife." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Were these my last accents," [...] {{said the}} reformer, [...] "and were they uttered at the stake, half-choked with smoke, {{and as the}} fagots kindled into a blaze <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> that last {{utterance}} I would testify against the superstitious devices of Rome." ...|$|R
6000|$|When late I sang sad was my voice, [...] Sad {{were the}} shows <b>around</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{deafening}} noises {{of hatred and}} [...] smoke of war; [...] In {{the midst of the}} conflict, the heroes, I stood, [...] Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.|$|R
6000|$|Boone wheeled <b>around</b> on <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{a menace}} in his eyes, but {{apparently}} mastering his temper with an effort, laughed unpleasantly. [...] "No. Take care {{you are not}} asked the same question. Are you disposed to let the horses roast while we quarrel?" ...|$|R
