40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{gain insight}} into work {{experiences}} and problems of subjects with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) to develop more effective guidelines for preventing work disability and work loss. Methods: A total of 617 patients aged 45 - 60, recruited from pulmonary outpatient clinics and general practices, completed a questionnaire on (respiratory) health and work history. Results: Of the patients 43 % were female, 52 % were employed and more than half were less educated. Comorbidity was present in 52 % of the study group. Of those who stopped working (N = 260), 36 % stopped before the onset of COPD, 39 % stopped because of COPD and 25 %, although having COPD, had other reasons to stop. Of the patients with a work history 39 % had <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> benefit: 21 % of the working and 60 % of the non-working patients. For one-third of these patients COPD was not the reason for having <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> benefit. For 56 % of those who had a benefit because of COPD, comorbidity contributed to work disability. No difference in current smoking habit was seen between working patients and non-working patients. Yet, non-working patients were more often smokers at the moment they stopped working. Furthermore, former smokers who still worked stopped smoking at a younger age than former smokers who stopped working. Compared with workers and independent of smoking habit, former workers were more exposed to dust/irritants, had their work(place) less frequently modified and had more unfavourable (social) work experiences. Conclusion: For employees with COPD, work loss is often multi-factorial. Comorbidity is often present and an important cause for work loss.

40|$|Selection and reorienting are two {{fundamental}} aspects of spatial attention. By means of event-related fMRI {{in a total}} of 26 subjects, we localised these two processes within a same experiment applying a probabilistic cytoarchitectonic reference frame. In a classical spatial cueing paradigm, the target was presented at the cued location either alone (60 % of trials) or in combination with a contralateral distracter ('competition trials', 20 % of trials), or at a location opposite to the cued location ('invalidly cued trials', 20 % of trials). In a sensory control experiment we differentiated between the attentional and the sensory effects of the distracter. In areas hIP 1 and hIP 3, competition trials exerted a significantly stronger attentional effect than invalidity trials. Conversely, area PF in the right hemisphere showed <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> effect in the absence of competition effect. A third type of response was found in areas PFm and PGa which showed both <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> and <b>a</b> competition effect. The combined study of selection and reorienting using a cytoarchitectonic reference frame enabled us to resolve the wide between-study variance in temporoparietal coordinates associated with the invalidity effect. Furthermore, the study demonstrated within a same experiment a functional dissociation between reorienting and selection in parietal cortex. Copyright 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|We propose an {{associative}} {{document retrieval}} method, {{in which a}} document {{is used as a}} query to search for other similar documents. Because a long document usually includes more than one topic, we first analyze a query document to extract multiple subtopics.

The relevance scores are weighted by the importance of each subtopic element and are integrated to determine the final relevant documents. In the calculation of the subtopic importance, the specificity of a query term is evaluated using entropy, which is the deviation degree of the appearances of the term in each subtopic element. We apply this method to <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> patent search.

40|$|Abstract: In linear systems Laplace {{transformation}} {{plays an}} important role, since it enables us to design controllers, switch between different types of system representations (mainly between a state-space description and an input-output representation). For those purposes we use well known transfer functions. Obviously, the situation is different when systems are nonlinear. The main problem, which makes the analysis and synthesis of such systems difficult, is <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> of basic principles employed in linear systems. Above all, it is the invalidity of the associativity which disables us to employ a linear theory and transfer functions. Nevertheless, an algebraic point of view, which presented paper introduces, enables to define a similar symbolic computation. From {{that point of view}} differential and derivative operators play a key role. In terms of the introduced symbolic computation the paper tries to depict a solution to a few basic control problems, namely a problem of modeling and a control design for nonlinear systems.

40|$|Context-aware {{adaptation}} is {{a central}} aspect of pervasive computing applications, enabling them to adapt and perform tasks based on contextual information. One of the aspects of context-aware adaptation is reconfiguration in which bindings are created between application component and remote services in order to realize new behaviour in response to contextual information. Various research efforts provide reconfiguration support and allow the development of adaptive context-aware applications from high-level specifications, but don't consider failure conditions that might arise during execution of such applications, making bindings between application and remote services invalid. To this end, we propose and implement our design approach to reconfiguration to manage invalid bindings. The development and modification of adaptive context-aware applications is a complex task, and an issue of <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> of bindings further complicates development efforts.

5000|$|The terms [...] "pro-choice" [...] and [...] "pro-life" [...] are {{examples}} of political framing.

40|$|It {{has become}} a bad {{tradition}} in the Polish-German relations that {{from time to time}} the problem of war reparations and claims for indemnity for the consequences of the Second World War is brought back. It is beyond all doubt that after 1989 neither the Polish diplomacy nor the theory of international law reacted {{to the fact that the}} problem of the assumption of German property by Poland after the Second World War was now in a different political context. Western superpowers signed treaties in which they shifted the obligation to pay indemnities to German citizens in connection with war reparations onto the German state. Poland has not managed to negotiate similar regulations with the Federal Republic of Germany. In the present situation, the so-called “treaty path” seems to be the most reasonable solution. It would refer to Józef Pilsudski’s policy, who led to the conclusion of the liquidation agreement between Poland and Germany on 31 October, 1929. After the “zero” effect has been reached in the negotiations with the Federal Republic of Germany the indemnity obligations would be shifted onto the German side in exchange for Polish waiver of war reparations. The question arises whether Poland has the right for them, considering the fact that it relinquished them in 1953. The declaration of the Polish government of 23 August, 1953 was a result of the Soviet dictate, which violated sovereignty of Poland and as a result of which the government of the Polish People’s Republic was not an equal partner for international relations. For that reason, it must be stated that there are serious premises indicating the thesis of invalidity of declaration of 23 August, 1953. The declaration of the government of the Polish People’s Republic of 23 April, 1953 is burdened with a defect in a declaration of will and, due to that, there is no need to withdraw it. The international law does not set any time limit within which <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> charge must be submitted. For that reason, the charge may be notified if the need arises. Submitting <b>an</b> <b>invalidity</b> charge of the declaration of 1953 is not equivalent to accepting a thesis about limiting Polish sovereignty during its membership in the Communist block. From the point of view of international law, in the aforementioned period Poland was a sovereign entity. Its home and foreign policy was under a strong political influence of the Soviet Union, which did not change its position in the international law. More than once this influence was clearly against the international law in force, so it was a violation of Polish sovereignty. For this reason, the declaration of 23 August, 1953 should be considered invalid and lacking legal consequences...|$|R
