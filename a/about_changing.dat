5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E
5|$|Johnson set <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> the wing's {{tactical}} approach. He quickly {{forced the}} wing {{to abandon the}} line-astern tactics for the finger-four formation which offered much more safety in combat; enabling multiple pilots to participate in scanning the skies for enemy aircraft {{so as to avoid}} an attack, and also being better able to spot and position their unit for a surprise attack upon the enemy. Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson's wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a fighter sweep, Ramrod 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. Unteroffizier Hans Hiess from 6 Staffel bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.|$|E

5|$|Katzenberg, Schneider, and Roy Disney set <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> {{the culture}} of the studio, {{increasing}} staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was Oliver & Company (1988), which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. Oliver & Company opened in the theaters on the same day as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, The Land Before Time; however, Oliver outgrossed Time and {{went on to become the}} most successful animated feature to that date.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Democratic {{leadership}} {{stated the}} bill {{might be taken}} from committee and brought to a debate before the full Senate, which was possible after March 10, 2009. Following a rally held on February 22, 2009, that opposed the passage of H.B. 444 and in which between 2,000 and 8,000 people participated, a number of Democratic senators became unwilling to {{vote in favor of}} the motion, citing concerns <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> common Senate procedure. The number of senators supporting civil unions was reduced from 18 to 13 out of 25 senators.

5|$|Due to {{the growing}} scale of the project, talks <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> Versus XIII into the next {{numbered}} entry in the series were appearing as early as 2007. When Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was renamed, and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were presented to Square Enix in 2011, {{it was decided to}} shift the game onto those consoles. For a time, a PlayStation 3 version continued development, but after a title change announcement could not be made in 2012, the shortening lifespan of the console caused concern for the company and team. After some trial and error, the PlayStation 3 was abandoned as lead platform in favor of a DirectX 11-based development structure that allowed for easy porting to the next-generation systems. Another presumed reason for the shift was due to the game's protracted development and escalating budget. The game was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and began development in this form in July 2012. At the beginning of development, the new team reviewed the content of Versus XIII and decided what could be sensibly carried over to the new project. While many design elements were retained, some needed to be changed or removed. Tabata's new position as co-director and eventually as director was related to this change. Intentions to turn the game into a musical after Nomura had seen the 2012 film adaptation of Les Misérables were vetoed by the higher-ups at Square Enix.|$|E

5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E

25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} it ought to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|E
25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, 2017, famous poker player, {{businessman}} and European Parliament member Antanas Guoga bought major stake {{of the club}} (2/4) from Sigitas Židonis and Remigijus Kazilionis. Two remaining stake owners Darius Gudelis and Vilnius City Municipality retained their rights to the club (1/4 each). On June 20, 2017, Gedvydas Vainauskas resigned from the Rytas president post following 20 years of operation since {{the founding of the}} club in 1997 just a week after receiving award from LKL president Remigijus Milašius for merits to basketball. Shortly after becoming new owner of the club, Guoga sparked discussions <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> the club's name and invited the public to offer their ideas since the team no longer have connections with the Vainauskas' newspaper Lietuvos rytas. The idea was strictly criticised by the club's elite fans group B Tribūna (Rytas Ultras), who told that the only team they will support is black-white-red Rytas. On June 21, 2017, the new owners organized a meeting, during which first changes were made: public institution Krepšinio rytas was renamed to Statyba in order to remember the historical BC Statyba, Darius Gudelis replaced Martynas Purlys in the club's director position and it was decided that the club's name Lietuvos rytas will be changed in not longer than 1-year term with the most likely but not yet final choice being Rytas. Guoga also told media that it is very likely that at least two Lithuanian basketball stars will participate in the team activities, bearing in mind Jonas Valančiūnas, Linas Kleiza and Arvydas Macijauskas. On July 4, 2017, Gudelis announced that former assistant coach Alberto Blanco and Linas Kleiza are joining the club, whose first task will be assisting Rimas Kurtinaitis to bring together new roster of the team. On July 13, 2017, press conference was held during which it was announced that Kleiza also became shareholder of the club by receiving part of the Guoga's stake, was named vice-president of the club and will also act as sports director. Limited liability company Norvelita and Perlas also became shareholders of the club.|$|E
