40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates an {{aggressive}} back off strategy {{as part of}} the congestion management algorithms developed for Direct Broadcast Satellites with Return Channel Systems (DBS-RCS). The satellite architecture considered in this work is based on an asymmetric architecture with the high capacity forward link provided by the DBS and low speed return channel is provided by a constellation of Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites. The network carries both Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) coded video traffic and other data traffic having <b>available</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>ABR)</b> which is based on Reliable DBS Multicast Protocol (RDMP). Due to overwhelming complexity of real DBS-RCS systems, unless unduly simplifications are made, an exact analysis of this system becomes impossible. Therefore, we rely on the testbed results for investigation of the proposed aggressive back off strategy. In this paper, we first present a brief background on adaptive resource allocation and management (ARAM) system developed in our earlier work [1]. Then, we provide the proof of concept experiments for the newly introduced aggressive back off strategy. We show that the distributed control provided by the watermarks provides performance comparable to the baseline ARAM model.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for realizing adaptive QoS control in the Internet called the adaptive load service (ALS). ALS was designed {{in a similar fashion}} to the <b>available</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> service (<b>ABR)</b> proposed for ATM. That is, the senders transmit control messages indicating their requirements, intermediate routers adjust the indicated values in accordance with their available resources and the receivers send the contents of the control messages back to the senders. The transmission behavior of the senders is then adjusted in accordance with the indicated values in the returned control messages. Unlike ABR, ALS is IP-based and was designed to scale for large multicast groups and accommodate the needs of heterogeneous receivers through the integration of sender-based and receiver-based adaptation mechanisms in addition to relying on the network feedback for adjusting the transmission behavior. Performance tests of ALS under different simulation topologies sho w its efficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization and loss reduction. The tests also show ALS to be fair towards competing TCP connections.

40|$|One recent {{development}} by the ATM Forum is a service class to carry ``bursty'' traffic, termed <b>Available</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> or <b>ABR.</b> <b>ABR</b> is a <b>rate</b> based service class {{that attempts to}} make optimal use of an ATM virtual circuit depending on the remaining bandwidth available along its route. The contract for an ABR circuit specifies parameters defining the maximum and minimum bandwidth available to it. Effective use of this available bandwidth is achieved {{by means of a}} rate control mechanism. If the network is experiencing congestion, the transmission <b>rate</b> of <b>ABR</b> traffic is decreased. Conversely, in an uncongested network the transmission rate is increased. The ABR source receives network information via Resource Management (RM) cells that are generated at regular intervals. These are returned by the destination to the ABR source, indicating any congestion experienced en route. In order to provide an acceptable transport mechanism, the effect of ABR traffic on other service classes, and in particular Constant <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> (CBR) traffic, must be minimal. However, due to the dynamic nature of the ABR service class it is not readily apparent that this will be the case. The aim of the paper is to investigate how, and to what extent, the ABR service class influences CBR traffic. Of particular interest are the variation in delay and the absolute delay experienced by CBR cells in the presence of ABR traffic. Discrete event simulation is used to investigate the performance of CBR traffic given certain parameters which characterise the ABR service. These describe the bounds within which the rate control mechanism operates and how the rate changes in response to the reception of RM cells. The performance of ABR traffic is determined by the point at which network congestion occurs and actions taken by the switch to detect and respond to congestion...|$|R

40|$|Data traffic {{has emerged}} as a big {{challenge}} for the standardization of traffic management mechanisms in ATM networks. In April 1996 the ATM Forum published the first version of the <b>Available</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> Service Category (<b>ABR)</b> to give support to this kind of traffic. ABR was designed with ambitious objectives: high network efficiency, fairness and inter-operability of different ABR switch mechanisms. The major part of this PhD Thesis has been devoted to ABR. Instead of focusing on one aspect of ABR, the main research topics involved in ABR have been covered, namely: (i) switching mechanisms, (ii) conformance definition, (iii) charging, (iv) ABR support to TCP traffic. In the following the main conclusions are summarized. Maybe, switch algorithms have been the most investigated topic of ABR. This has happened because the specification of ABR given by the ATM Forum allows a diversity of switch algorithms to be implemented. These range from the simplest binary switches to the more complex ER switches. In the PhD Thesis three of these switch algorithms are analyzed by means of simulation, showing the different degree of performance and complexity that can be achieved. The behavior of ER switches is also analyzed by means of real traces obtained with a commercial ER switch. The conformance definition is the formalism established to decide whether the source transmits according to the traffic contract. The conformance algorithm standardized for ABR is the Dynamic Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (DGCRA). The PhD Thesis gives {{a detailed description of the}} DGCRA. Furthermore, traces obtained by simulation are depicted showing that the algorithm given by the ATM Forum has a decreasing accuracy of the rate conformance with increasing feedback delay. A "UPC based on the CCR" is proposed to solve this drawback. The parameter dimensioning of the DGCRA is addressed in the PhD Thesis by means of two analytical approaches. Numerical results calculated with the analytical models are also obtained by simulation for validation. The analytical approaches are based on a novel queuing model of the DGCRA. The first analytical approach is based on a renewal assumption of the cell inter-arrival process at the UPC. This approach gives a simple but coarse approximation of the cell rejection probability at the UPC. The second analytical method consists of a Markov chain that accurately describes the stochastic variables involved in the queuing model of the DGCRA. The Markov chain is solved applying the matrix geometric technique. The complexity of this mathematical approach only allows investigating a simple network topology. However, the accuracy of the model allows taking into account the influence of the delay bounds that are negotiated with the DGCRA. This study shows that a major degradation of the cell rejection probability may be obtained if these delay bounds are not properly set. Another issue investigated in the PhD Thesis is the charging of ABR. Charging may have a decisive impact on the deployment, success and growth of a network. In fact, the research community has paid a great attention to this topic in recent years. Furthermore, pricing may be an essential condition for the users when submitting traffic. Some authors have used this fact to propose congestion control mechanisms based on a dynamic pricing. In such schemes, prices vary according to the demand of network resources by the sources. New prices are conveyed to the sources by means of a feedback mechanism. This charging scheme seems to fit well with ABR, since the RM-cells can be used to dynamically communicate the prices. In the PhD Thesis a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed and an analytical model is used to find out the evolution of the prices. Additionally, several charging schemes are confronted by simulation. This comparison shows that the dynamic pricing gives the best expected charging. Finally, the support of ABR to the traffic generated with the TCP protocol used in the Internet is investigated by simulation. Currently, the data communications are dominated by the Internet traffic transported by a variety of networks. The deployment of ATM technology has been located in the backbone networks and the end-to-end ATM systems appear remote. In fact, it is not clear whether the universal multi-service network will be built on the Internet rather than the B-ISDN. Simulations performed in the PhD Thesis confront the transport of TCP traffic in different scenarios using ABR and the simpler UBR Service Category. The main conclusion is that ABR can solve the severe fairness problems that can arise using UBR. Postprint (published version...|$|R
