Today, the advanced engine technologies require innovative filter media with higher performances. A virtual microstructure of the nonwoven filter medium, which has similar filter properties as the existing material, {{can be used to}} design new filter media from existing media. Nonwoven materials considered in this thesis prominently feature non-overlapping fibers, curved fibers, fibers with circular cross section, fibers of apparently infinite length, and fiber bundles. To this end, as part of this thesis, we extend the Altendorf-Jeulin individual fiber model to incorporate all the above mentioned features. The resulting novel stochastic 3 D fiber model can generate geometries with good visual resemblance of real filter media.

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{improved}} automotive target tracking scheme using FMCW radar which {{is necessary for}} the advanced collision warning systems. Since there exist strong nonlinear relationships between the FMCW radar measurements and the target state, the target tracking and data association in dense road clutters have been recognized as a quite challenging problem. It is obvious that the use of accurate range rate measurement might be an excellent choice to improve both target tracking and clutter suppression performances. This motivates us to develop a novel linear recursive <b>automotive</b> target tracking <b>filter</b> based on the measurement conversion in the predicted line-of-sight (LOS) Cartesian coordinate system (PLCCS). Since the x axis of the PLCCS is set by the predicted LOS vector from the host to the target, if the LOS prediction error is imperceptible, the range rate can be approximated to the x component of the relative target velocity in PLCCS. Employing the PLCCS drastically reduces the complexity of the problem and allows us to solve it within the framework of linear recursive Kalman filtering. Through the simulations, the superiority of the proposed method is compared to the existing nonlinear <b>automotive</b> target tracking <b>filters...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The FRAM brand {{was born}} when the {{original}} chemists, Frederick Franklin and T. Edward Aldam, invented an easily replaceable oil filtering element in their Providence, R.I. laboratory. The name FRAM {{was derived from the}} chemists' last names—the first two letters of Frederick's last name [...] "Franklin", and the last two letters for Edward's last name [...] "Aldam". Other sources claim that the brand was inspired {{in the name of the}} FRAM vessel used by Roald Amundsen and other explorers to their expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, because Fram means “Forward”. and moreover it's pronounced the same in many languages. Incorporated in 1934, the FRAM Corporation was formed by James Edward Bigwood with the help of Steve Wilson. Steve Wilson was the first president of the FRAM Company, and James Bigwood was the treasurer. James Bigwood chose the colors black and orange to be FRAM's colors. FRAM is one of the major brands of aftermarket <b>automotive</b> oil <b>filters</b> in the United States and Canada.|$|R
40|$|Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT), an {{approach}} to robust decision making under severe uncertainty, is newly considered {{in the context of}} a simple life cycle engineering example. IGDT offers a path to a decision in the class of problems where a nominal estimate of an uncertain life cycle parameter is available, but the amount of the deviation of that estimate from the actual value, as well as the implications of that deviation on performance, are not known. The decision rule inherent in IGDT entails relaxing one’s demand for optimal performance and choosing designs with maximum immunity, or info-gap robustness, to the effects of deviation from the known estimate. This tradeoff is analyzed graphically using plots of robustness versus performance demand. In this paper, an <b>automotive</b> oil <b>filter</b> design example affected by severe uncertainty is formulated and solved using an IDGT approach. The types of life cycle engineering design problems that the approach could be effective towards are discussed, as are potential limitations that could be encountered when solving more complex problems...|$|R

40|$|Used <b>automotive</b> oil <b>filter</b> {{disposal}} is a {{real and}} increasing problem in the United States. With over 450 million oil filters sold each year, and 80 % of used filters thrown into landfills, this waste represents a significant toxic waste problem for the country. There {{are a number of}} economic and technological challenges in improving the overall rate of proper disposal of these filters, one of which is a recycling and disposal system that currently provides monetary incentives for crushing, rather than cleaning these filters. This paper extends previous research done by a group of MIT students into a low cost device for effective compaction of used oil filters. Testing is done on compacting heads of various shapes to determine crushing geometries to improve volume reduction for a given load. As a result, a sample system is designed and presented which is estimated to achieve at least 15 % compaction of used filters using only 1000 lb-force for less than $ 200 in retail parts. by Richard D.

5000|$|Early {{automobile}} engines {{did not use}} oil filters. For this reason, {{along with}} the generally low quality of oil available, very frequent oil changes were required. The first oil filters were simple, generally consisting of a screen placed at the oil pump intake. On November 27, 1923, American inventors George Greenhalgh and Ernest Sweetland filed U.S. Patent #1721250 for an <b>automotive</b> oil <b>filter</b> and called it the Purolator, a portmanteau of [...] "pure oil later". The Purolator oil filter was the first oil filter invented for the automobile and revolutionized the filtration industry. The Purolator oil filter is still in production today. This original invention was a bypass filter: most of the oil flowed directly from the oil pan to the engine's working parts, and a smaller proportion of the oil was sent through the filter via a second flow path in parallel with the first. The oil was thus filtered over time. Modern bypass oil filter systems for diesel engines are becoming popular in consumer applications, but have been in commercial use for some time due to potential reduction in maintenance costs.Oil filters are generally located near the middle or bottom of the engine.|$|R

50|$|Early {{engine oil}} filters were of {{cartridge}} (or replaceable element) construction, {{in which a}} permanent housing contains a replaceable filter element or cartridge. The housing is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and return pipes connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the spin-on oil filter design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of oil filter installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with cartridge-type filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to cartridge-type filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available <b>automotive</b> oil <b>filters</b> vary in their design, materials, and construction details. Ones that are made from completely synthetic material excepting the metal drain cylinders contained within are far superior and longer lasting than the traditional cardboard/cellulose/paper type that still predominate. These variables affect the efficacy, durability, and cost of the filter.|$|R

Soot particles deposit on the electrodes, which leads to an increase in current or decrease in resistance. If installed upstream of a DPF, the “engine-out” soot emissions can also be determined directly by soot sensors. Sensors were characterized in diesel engine real exhausts under varying operation conditions and with two different kinds of diesel fuel. The sensor signal was correlated to the actual soot mass and particle number, measured with an SMPS. Sensor data and soot analytics (SMPS) agreed very well, an impressing linear correlation in a double logarithmic representation was found.

30|$|From {{the view}} point of {{biomedical}} engineering, the element silver {{is well known}} for its broad spectrum antibacterial effect at very low concentrations [23], and it possesses many advantages, such as good antibacterial ability, excellent biocompatibility, and satisfactory stability [24, 25]. The scientific literature points to the wide use of silver in numerous applications. It is well established that silver nanoparticles are known for their strong antibacterial effects for a wide array of organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi) [26]. Therefore, silver nanoparticles are widely used in medical devices and supplies such as wound dressings, scaffold, skin donation, recipient sites, and sterilized materials in hospitals, medical catheters, contraceptive devices, surgical instruments, bone prostheses, artificial teeth, and bone coating. One can also observe their wide use in consumer products such as cosmetics, lotions, creams, toothpastes, laundry detergents, soaps, surface cleaners, room sprays, toys, antimicrobial paints, home appliances (e.g., washing machines, air, and water <b>filters),</b> <b>automotive</b> upholstery, shoe insoles, brooms, food storage containers, and textiles [27 – 30].|$|R
40|$|Particle Adsorption, {{particle}} absorption and break through curves {{are of interest}} in diverse applications like <b>automotive</b> air <b>filters,</b> water filters and subsurface transport settings. They are notoriously difficult to predict because they depend on many parameters such as the adsorption capability of the material and the pore geometry of the porous media. The aim of this work is to propose ways to predict these quantities based on direct numerical simulations with the software GeoDict. At first an accurate three-dimensional micro-structural representation of the geometry of a porous media is constructed. Examples are the CT image of a fracture in granite, and the computer model of an active carbon filter media based on a micro CT image. Based on the microstructure model the fluid flow through the pores of the media is computed. The flow field {{is the basis for}} the third step, the tracking of particles, considering their interaction with the material surfaces and modelling the time-dependent absorption or adsorption on these surfaces. For the CT image of granite the break through curves were modelled and measured for the same rock sample. On the one hand, tracer particles are monitored, and on the other hand, break through curve simulations were performed on the CT image of the same sample. The comparison shows a good agreement between simulation and measurement. For the model of the active carbon filter media an iterative filtration simulation, with additional modelling of deposition-dependant surface-adsorption, is performed. The sub-grain porosity of the media is modelled by the effective surface adsorption on the grain surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Activate carbon {{impregnated}} with {{a mixture}} of copper oxide and zinc oxide performs well as active adsorber for NO 2 removal in <b>automotive</b> cabin air <b>filters.</b> The oxide-loaded activated carbon exhibits superior long-term stability in comparison to pure activated carbon as has been shown in previous studies. The carbon material was loaded only with 2. 5 wt% of each metal oxide. Characterization of the oxide nanoparticles within the pores of the activated carbon is difficult because of the rather low concentration of the oxides. Therefore, a systematic study was performed to evaluate the limits of line profile analysis of X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The method allows evaluation of crystalline domain size distributions, crystal defect concentrations and twinning probabilities of nanoscopic materials. Here, the analysis is hampered by the presence of several phases including more or less amorphous carbon. By using physical mixtures of defined copper oxide and zinc oxide particles with activated carbon, potential errors and limits could be identified. The contribution of the activated carbon to the scattering curve was modeled with a convolution of an exponential decay curve, a Chebyshev polynomial, and two Lorentzian peaks. With this approach, domain size distributions can be calculated that are shifted only by about 0. 5 – 1. 0 nm for very low loadings (≤ 4 wt%). Oxide loadings of 4 wt% and 5 wt% allow very reliable analyses from diffraction patterns measured in Bragg–Brentano and Debye–Scherrer geometry, respectively. For the real adsorber material, mean domain sizes have been calculated to be 2. 8 nm and 2. 4 nm before and after the NO 2 removal tests...|$|R
40|$|This thesis makes five {{important}} {{contributions to the}} development of an <b>automotive</b> safety system: <b>filtering</b> algorithms, three modelling frameworks concerning the usage of radar detections in tracking, vehicle motion, and decision-making for intervention decisions, and finally the implementation architecture. In the filtering context, we have developed a new sigma-point method for estimating the moments of a transformed Gaussian random variable. These estimates are derived from analytical expressions and are based on evaluations of the transforming function. The method is applied to the moment estimation task in a Gaussian filter and the resulting algorithm is denoted the marginalised Kalman filter (MKF). Compared to traditional radar models, ours is specifically designed for vehicle radars, which often yield several measurements from each object. These measurements can provide useful information, such as vehicle orientation, if they are accurately modelled. We introduce a tracking filter using such a sensor model, and show how the complex data association problem can be facilitated by merging similar hypotheses into groups. The presented vehicle motion model includes the control input from the driver. Uncertainties regarding, e. g., driver style, are formally treated with increased prediction accuracy as a result. Similar to this model, the third framework also takes the driver into consideration by allowing interventions only when the driver is believed to accept them. Our evaluations indicate an increased benefit in collision avoidance systems [...] - particularly in traffic situations where the future trajectory of another road user is hard for the driver to predict. Finally, we present a modular functional design for implementing a real-time data fusion system. We conclude that a tracking system, using modern estimation techniques, is well suited for sensor data fusion in an automotive environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} different <b>automotive</b> cabin air <b>filters</b> to prevent penetration of components of diesel exhaust and thereby reduce biomedical effects in human subjects. Filtered air and unfiltered diluted diesel exhaust (DDE) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, and were compared with exposure to DDE filtered with four different filter systems. METHODS: 32 Healthy non- smoking subjects (age 21 - 53) participated in the study. Each subject was exposed six times for 1 hour in a specially designed exposure chamber: once to air, once to unfiltered DDE, and once to DDE filtered with the four different cabin air filters. Particle concentrations during exposure to unfiltered DDE were kept at 300 micrograms/m 3. Two of the filters were particle filters. The other two were particle filters combined with active charcoal filters that might reduce certain gaseous components. Subjective symptoms were recorded and nasal airway lavage (NAL), acoustic rhinometry, and lung function measurements were performed. RESULTS: The two particle filters decreased the concentrations of diesel exhaust particles by about half, but did not reduce the intensity of symptoms induced by exhaust. The combination of active charcoal filters and a particle filter significantly reduced the symptoms and discomfort caused by the diesel exhaust. The most noticable differences in efficacy between the filters {{were found in the}} reduction of detection of an unpleasant smell from the diesel exhaust. In this respect even the two charcoal filter combinations differed significantly. The efficacy to reduce symptoms may depend on the abilities of the filters investigated to reduce certain hydrocarbons. No acute effects on NAL, rhinometry, and lung function variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the use of active charcoal filters, and a particle filter, clearly reduced the intensity of symptoms induced by diesel exhaust. Complementary studies on vehicle cabin air filters may result in further diminishing the biomedical effects of diesel exhaust in subjects exposed in traffic and workplaces...|$|R
