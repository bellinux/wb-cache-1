5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke (born 1978) is a Tunis-born, Berlin-based visual artist {{best known}} for her {{conceptual}} art and 2011 sculpture Flying Carpets. Her work has explored themes of geopolitics, immigration, <b>and</b> <b>transnational</b> identities. Raised between Tunis, Kiev, and Dubai, she studied at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts and received a Ph.D. in philosophy of art from the Sorbonne. Kaabi-Linke won the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize, which commissioned Flying Carpets, a hanging cage-like sculpture that casts geometric shadows onto the floor akin to the carpets of Venetian street vendors. The piece was acquired by the New York Guggenheim in 2016 as part of their Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative. Kaabi-Linke also won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong. Her works have been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Burger Collection, and Samdani Art Foundation, and exhibited in multiple solo and group shows.|$|E

25|$|Derek Gregory argues {{the long}} {{trajectory}} through history of British and American colonization {{is an ongoing}} process still happening today. In The Colonial Present, Gregory traces connections between the geopolitics of events happening in modern-day Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq and links {{it back to the}} us-and-them binary relation between the Western and Eastern world. Building upon the ideas of the other and Said's work on orientialism, Gregory critiques the economic policy, military apparatus, <b>and</b> <b>transnational</b> corporations as vehicles driving present day colonialism. Emphasizing ideas of discussing ideas around colonialism in the present tense, Gregory utilizes modern events such as the September 11 attacks to tell spatial stories around the colonial behavior happening due to the War on Terror.|$|E
25|$|According to the United Nations, the {{proportion}} of urban dwellers living in slums decreased from 47 percent to 37 percent {{in the developing world}} between 1990 and 2005. However, due to rising population, the absolute number of slum dwellers is rising. The majority of these come from the fringes of urban margins, located in legal and illegal settlements with insufficient housing and sanitation. This has been caused by massive migration, both internal <b>and</b> <b>transnational,</b> into cities, which has caused growth rates of urban populations and spatial concentrations not seen before in history. These issues raise problems in the political, social, and economic arenas. Slum dwellers often have minimal or no access to education, healthcare, or the urban economy.|$|E
