5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents {{the history of the}} Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who,</b> twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
5|$|LeToya Luckett and Roberson became {{unhappy with}} Mathew's {{managing}} {{of the band}} and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted {{for a couple of}} years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> helped her fight it. Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.|$|E

5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old girl at {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick Cowper, the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation could be given for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. Cowper continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from Cowper, accused four local women of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E

25|$|Dürckheim is {{identified}} by Albert Stunkard <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> suggested that Stunkard should visit D.T.

"I {{came of age}} in my {{still work}} in the period of the mid-80s, the period of gender-bending, the {{beginning}} of the breakdown of the traditional gender roles which we're now living in, a period which is pretty important today ...I have always been attracted to a powerful female figure, I'm sure there's a part of me in that. All portraits, in my opinion, are as much as a portrait of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> made <b>the</b> image, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who's</b> being depicted in the image.

25|$|Unit trust: A trust {{where the}} {{beneficiaries}} (called unitholders) each possess a certain share (called units) and can direct the trustee to pay money to {{them out of}} the trust property according to the number of units they possess. A unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment, rather than disposition, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|Corydon {{hints that}} he would like his own farm, in {{contrast}} to his current life of rustic labour and asks Meliboeus to take his poetry/songs to the emperor.

25|$|Watanuki {{was created}} by Clamp {{following}} their {{need to have a}} main character who would observe Yūko's work and learn from her supernatural activities. His character has been well received by publications for manga and anime due to his role in the series and character development. Several positive comments also focused on his role in the series' last arc where he succeeds Yūko <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> grants people's wishes.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{inaccuracy}} is that Robin Janvrin {{is represented}} as the Queen's private secretary during {{the aftermath of}} Diana's death. In fact, that position was then occupied by Janvrin's predecessor, Sir Robert Fellowes, a brother-in-law of Diana, Princess of Wales; Janvrin was the deputy private secretary until 1999. However, the film is accurate in depicting Janvrin <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> delivered the news of Diana's accident to the Queen at Balmoral during the night.|$|E
25|$|The BBC TV series The Real Hustle {{showed a}} {{variation}} of the lottery scam in which a group of scammers pretended to have won a lottery, but was prevented from claiming the prize <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> wrote the name {{on the back of the}} ticket was supposedly out of the country on that date. They were able to persuade a stranger to put up money as collateral in order to share in the prize pool.|$|E
25|$|Oedipus was {{a figure}} {{who was also}} used in the Latin {{literature}} of ancient Rome. Julius Caesar wrote a play on Oedipus, {{but it has not}} survived into modern times. Ovid included Oedipus in Metamorphoses, but only <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> defeated the Sphinx. He makes no mention of Oedipus' troubled experiences with his father and mother. Seneca the Younger wrote his own play on the story of Oedipus in the first century AD. It differs in significant ways from the work of Sophocles.|$|E

As a part of this programme, the Balloon Factory at Farnborough was to be removed from the military and placed under civilian scientific administration. In October 1909 O'Gorman was appointed as the first civilian Superintendent of the Balloon Factory. He replaced Col. John Capper, who retained his command of the Army Balloon School also located there.|$|E
25|$|When {{he began}} his {{collaborative}} film work, he was influenced by Robert Alton and John Murray Anderson, striving to create moods and character insight with his dances. He choreographed his own movement, along {{with that of the}} ensemble, with the assistance of Jeanne Coyne, Stanley Donen, Carol Haney and Alex Romero. He experimented with lighting, camera techniques and special effects in order to achieve true integration of dance with film, {{and was one of the}} first to use split screens, double images, live action with animation and is credited <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne gained {{celebrity status}} {{as one of}} the stars of MTV's reality show, The Osbournes, which {{followed}} her family's daily life and had a national audience. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> negotiated with MTV to screen the show, she is often credited with bringing about her husband's emergence from heavy metal icon into mainstream celebrity. The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV's British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003.

When they reached the palace of Holyrood, they were challenged by the sentinel on duty there. They said that they were friends of Earl Bothwell, bringing dispatches to him from the country. The sentinel asked them if they knew what was the cause of that loud explosion. They said they did not, and passed on.|$|R

25|$|The Act also {{introduced}} criminal penalties for corrupt officialdom. An official or {{employee of the}} government who acts corruptly—as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> induces the corrupt act—in the carrying out of their official duties will be fined by an amount that is not {{more than three times}} the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. Penalties apply to financial institutions who do not comply with an order to terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days of being so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury. The financial institution can be fined $US10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.|$|E
25|$|Bell {{appeared}} to have spent little time in the Volta Laboratory. Tainter's unpublished manuscript and notes (later donated to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History) depict Bell <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> suggested the basic lines of research, furnished the financial resources, and then allowed his associates to receive the credit {{for many of the}} inventions that resulted. The experimental machines built at the Volta Laboratory include both disc and cylinder types, with some of the disc type turntables rotating vertically about a horizontal axis, as well as a hand-powered, non-magnetic tape recorder. The records and tapes used with the machines were donated to the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History, and were believed to be the oldest reproducible bona fide sound recordings preserved anywhere in the world. While some were scratched and cracked, others were still in good condition when they were received.|$|E
25|$|After Virginia {{ratified}} the constitution, Madison returned to New York {{to resume his}} duties in the Congress of the Confederation. At the request of Washington, Madison sought {{a seat in the}} United States Senate, but his election was blocked by Patrick Henry. Madison then decided to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. At Henry's behest, the Virginia legislature created congressional districts designed to deny Madison a seat, and Henry recruited a strong challenger to Madison in James Monroe. Locked in a difficult race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect individual liberties. Madison's promise paid off, as he won election to Congress with 57% of the vote. He would continue to serve in the House until 1797, when Madison briefly left public office to preside over his plantation. Early in his tenure, Madison became an ally of President Washington, who looked to Madison <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> best understood the constitution.|$|E
