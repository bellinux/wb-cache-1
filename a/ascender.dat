5|$|Some modern {{computer}} fonts {{and printed}} books {{have attempted to}} correct this perceived fault: {{in some of the}} books in John Jenkins' Deseret Alphabet Classics series, the font used adds a descender to êëâ and êêª and an <b>ascender</b> to êêº and êëá among other tweaks.|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>Ascender</b> II+, the <b>Ascender</b> III-C can {{be fitted}} with a sidecar to become a two-seat trainer version.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ascender</b> III-C is {{equivalent}} to the Pterodactyl <b>Ascender</b> II+ with the heavy-duty style airframe. It sold for USD$8100 in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have <b>ascenders</b> and descenders. This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow <b>ascenders</b> and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|R

25|$|The Pterodactyl <b>Ascender</b> is {{a family}} of U.S. {{designed}} and built ultralight aircraft that were sold in kit form between 1979 and 1984 under Pterodactyl Limited and is currently being sold by DFE Ultralights.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ascender</b> III-A {{is similar}} to the {{original}} Pterodactyl Pfledge. It lacks a canard and pitch control is by weight shift, although it incorporates some refinements, such as nose wheel steering. The 2003 price was USD$6800.|$|E
25|$|In the lowercase, the {{crossbar}} {{is usually}} drawn through the <b>ascender,</b> but when {{used as a}} phonetic symbol it may be preferred to draw it through the bowl, in which case it {{is known as a}} barred d. In some African languages' orthographies, such as that of Moro, the barred d is preferred.|$|E

Variants of which were placed above and were ¬ø-like, tilde (crossing <b>ascender)</b> and similar to the us mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers that {{practice}} platform sharing {{have the ability}} to create several models based on the same design, but with different names. This leads to the public looking over certain models and cannibalized sales from competing divisions with essentially the same product. This was prevalent among U.S. domestic manufactures from the 1970s onward, e.g., the Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X, and Isuzu <b>Ascender.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Early 1980s a Pterodactyl pilot named Jeff Ballas {{attended}} the Sun-N-Fun fly-in and {{was impressed with}} the mylar covering on the Lazair. He bought a roll of mylar and some tape, went home and re-covered his canard with the clear mylar. This experiment was a success. The handling of an <b>Ascender</b> with the lightweight mylar was much lighter and increased the nimble feeling of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ascenders</b> are {{mechanical}} {{devices for}} ascending on a rope. They are also called Jumars, after a popular brand.|$|R
5000|$|The upper {{portions}} of letters (<b>ascenders)</b> play a stronger {{part in the}} recognition process than the lower portions.|$|R
5000|$|Jumaring, also {{referred}} to as jugging, is where the second climber (the one who belays the lead climber on the route) uses <b>ascenders</b> to climb the rope instead of climbing directly on the rock. Along with the <b>ascenders,</b> one or more webbing [...] "ladders" [...] called √©triers (or aiders) are typically used to allow climbers to use their feet to step up and pull themselves up the rope.|$|R
