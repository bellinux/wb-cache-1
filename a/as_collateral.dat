5|$|With the unpopularity of the doctrine, the {{judiciary}} developed several ways around it.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Patent paraumbilical and {{abdominal}} subcutaneous veins {{are found}} frequently <b>as</b> <b>collaterals</b> in patients due to portal hypertension mainly in liver cirrhosis. Case presentation For evaluation of portal hypertension in a 72 -year-old Caucasian man without liver cirrhosis, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} with gadolinium contrast-enhancement was performed and demonstrated a missing inferior vena cava. A blood return from the lower extremities was shown through enlarged collateral veins of the abdominal wall, vena azygos and hemiazygos continuation, and multiple liver veins emptying into the right cardiac atrium. We describe a rare case of abdominal subcutaneous wall veins <b>as</b> <b>collaterals</b> caused by a congenitally absent infrarenal inferior vena cava with preservation of a hypoplastic suprarenal segment. Conclusion Knowledge of these congenital variations can be of clinical importance and it is imperative for the reporting radiologist to identify these anomalies as {{they can have a}} significant impact on the clinical management of the patient. </p...|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, a Dallas company {{known as}} the General American Finance System, {{struggling}} through the Great Depression, began to finance drilling operations in the state using oil reserves <b>as</b> <b>collateral.</b> This allowed Dallas to establish itself as the financing center for the oil industry. The Great American Finance System eventually reorganized itself as the General American Oil Company of Texas, which became an oil producer {{in its own right}} and, decades later, was purchased by Phillips Petroleum.|$|E
5|$|In September 1976, Boston {{law firm}} Ropes & Gray opined that the state's $27 million {{municipal}} bond issue {{could not go}} forward using property within the claim area <b>as</b> <b>collateral.</b> On September 29, Governor Longley flew to Washington, and Maine's delegtion introduced legislation directing the federal courts not to hear the tribe's claim; Congress adjourned before the bills could be considered.|$|E

His colleagues now shun him, the Bone War feud having alienated them, and he is forced to go to Barnum to try to obtain a loan, with the very Mexican antiquities he'd outbid Barnum on before <b>as</b> <b>collateral.</b>|$|E

40|$|In 60 % of {{patients}} with post-phlebitic syndrome lymphography of the lower extremity shows involvement of the deep system. In 77 % of the patients {{there was an increase}} in the number and caliber of the deep lymphatic vessels. They frequently appear elongated, tortuous, and ectatic but usually do not show signs of insufficiency. It appears as if these vessels act <b>as</b> <b>collaterals</b> and compensate for deficiencies of the deep venous circulation.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright. The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: repurchase agreements, or collateralised loans. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used <b>as</b> <b>collaterals</b> for loans, the difference being of legal nature. In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid.|$|R
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares <b>as</b> <b>collateral</b> for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E

On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F.

5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having {{enough money to buy}} release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka <b>as</b> <b>collateral.</b> Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Romney soon {{switched}} Bain Capital's {{focus from}} startups {{to the relatively}} new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets <b>as</b> <b>collateral,</b> then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years. Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns. The firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation, Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, Sealy Corporation, Sports Authority, and Artisan Entertainment, {{as well as some}} lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors. Much of the firm's profit was earned from {{a relatively small number of}} deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO <b>as</b> <b>collateral).</b> Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock <b>as</b> <b>collateral.</b> Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the company}}, perpetually undercapitalized {{by its own}} admission, faced {{mounting}} financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an indemnity bond to avoid the impoundment of President Arthur for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit. The following month, President Arthur was used <b>as</b> <b>collateral</b> for $100,000 loan from a Bronx bank, {{but it was too}} little, too late. American Palestine Line was placed in receivership on September 11 by federal judge Thomas D. Thacher of the U.S. District Court after suit was brought by a creditor. Eight days later, President Arthur, docked at the foot of West 34th Street, experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the New York City Fire Department fireboat James Duane. In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings, charges the company denied. By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, President Arthur was back {{in the hands of the}} USSB, and the furniture and fixtures of the American Palestine offices were sold at public auction by the company's receiver in early March 1926.|$|E

40|$|ECB’s decision, {{to suspend}} the waiver for the {{acceptance}} of Greek bonds <b>as</b> loan <b>collaterals,</b> came <b>as</b> a shock to Greece but was rather expected by the markets (although this does not preclude a strong ‘market reaction’). The decision per se does not have immediately dire consequences for the Greek economy. It raises the cost of borrowing for Greek banks (from 0. 05 % to 1. 5 %) but it doesn’t stop their access to liquidity, as this {{will continue to be}} provided by the Bank of Greece through the ELA mechanism. The decision is moreover rather sensible {{from the point of view}} of Central Bank finance, as Greece indeed cannot be assumed to be in an adjustment programme given the recent pronouncements of the Greek government (recall that the ECB accepted Greek bonds <b>as</b> <b>collaterals,</b> which are not credit-worthy in a market-rating sense, solely on the basis of the implicit guarantee by the Eurogroup that Greece’s solvency is guaranteed as long as the country remains in an adjustment programme) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1223, King HenryIII {{met with}} the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth at Ludlow Castle for peace talks, but the {{negotiations}} were unsuccessful. The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter's activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, Ludlow Castle {{was taken over by}} the Crown for a period of two years. This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry's enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000marks for the return of his castles and lands. During the 1230s, however, Walter had accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay. As a result, in 1238 he gave Ludlow Castle <b>as</b> <b>collateral</b> to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.|$|E
5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists <b>as</b> <b>collateral</b> so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia <b>as</b> <b>collateral</b> for loans {{throughout}} the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
