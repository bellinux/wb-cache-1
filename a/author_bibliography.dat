50|$|While the {{organization}} of information {{has been going on}} since antiquity, bibliographic control {{as we know it today}} is a more recent invention. Ancient civilizations recorded lists of books onto tablets and libraries in the Middle Ages kept records of their holdings. With the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, multiple copies of a single book could be produced quickly. Johann Tritheim, a German librarian, was the first to create a bibliography in chronological order with an alphabetical author index. Konrad Gesner followed in his footsteps in the next century as he published an <b>author</b> <b>bibliography</b> and subject index. He added to his bibliography an alphabetical list of authors with inverted names, which was a new practice. He also included references to variant spellings of author's names, a precursor to authority control. Andrew Maunsell further revolutionized bibliographic control by suggesting that a book should be findable based on the author's last name, the subject of the book, and the translator. In the 17th century Sir Thomas Bodley was interested in a catalog arranged alphabetically by author's last name as well as subject entries. In 1697, Frederic Rostgaard called for subject arrangement that was subdivided by both chronology and by size (whereas in the past titles were arranged by their size only), as well as an index of subjects and authors by last name and for word order in titles to be preserved based on the title page.|$|E

40|$|This book is {{designed}} to guide readers as they consider establishing a full-service school in their community. Drawing on a working model with a 5 -year history of development and implementation, the book shows how schools and community social, welfare, and health agencies can work together to deliver services to children and their families. After explaining what a full-service school is, the book explores some of the myths that exist about such schools, and presents a blueprint for collaboration that provides information about stakeholders and services and lists suggestions for correlating the planning process with needs and resource assessment. Ten strategies for assessing needs and resources are detailed. Separate chapters are devoted to financing {{the construction of a}} full-service school, approaching granting agencies and evaluating services, and sharing information on publicity, training, interagency agreements, and cross-training. Fourteen appendices provide stages, steps, and phases of implementation; goals; job descriptions; funding sources; program evaluation; training topics; and other information.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this master thesis is F. V. Krejci's {{literary}} criticism. It analyses {{not only his}} approach to literary criticism as presented in his major as well as minor texts, but also his own output in the Rozhledy revue, presumably the best representative of modern literary-critical tendencies of the 1890 s. The Rozhledy revue and F. V. Krejci's literary- critical output (including his monographs) both {{help us understand the}} literature of the second half of 19 th century with its diversities as well as the way how the young generation of literary critics used to form their methodological aspects. The body of this master thesis is created by the complete and annotated bibliography of F. V. Krejci's texts published in Rozhledy. The research was based on both - the detailed study and analysis of the main sources and the <b>author</b> <b>bibliography</b> provided by the Institute of Czech Literature AS CR. In Rozhledy, F. V. Krejci published various political and literary articles. He also reviewed a few books. In his reviews, he usually wrote a non-detailed foreword and introduction.

40|$|A contemporaneidade traz variadas demandas ao homem. A experiência religiosa figura dentre as demandas existentes. É inegável que o Brasil passa por uma efervescência religiosa. Cresce o número de professos e aqueles que declaram sem religião. Diante deste cenário se tem a necessidade da investigação criteriosa a partir de referenciais que buscam o balizamento equilibrado e assim expandir os estudos no campo da psicologia da religião. O pastor protestante Oskar Pfister foi um árduo pesquisador no campo, tanto da religião como da psicologia. O objetivo do presente trabalho busca compreender a relevância de Oskar Pfister e sua contribuição ao campo da psicologia da religião. Para tanto, se fez uso de uma extensa investigação bibliográfica do autor e obras correspondentes de outros autores, que serviram de base para aproximações do debate psicologia e religião, isto em três capítulos. No primeiro capítulo, se realizou uma biografia de Oskar Pfister e as principais influências epistemológicas. Tem como objetivo {{investigar}} como Oskar Pfister constrói seu pensamento até o encontro com a psicologia freudiana. No segundo capítulo, se pesquisa a contribuição de Oskar Pfister a psicologia da religião. Tem como objetivo, levantar e apontar as aproximações pfisterianas ao contexto religioso, bem como, o legado deixado no campo da psicologia da religião. No terceiro capítulo, se pesquisa o diálogo entre o pensamento pfisteriano e o fenômeno religioso. Tem como objetivo aproximar as temáticas da psicologia e religião e como estes saberes se constituem na contemporaneidade como uma fundamental base com vistas a compreensão da relação psicologia e religião. Nas reflexões finais, se objetiva resgatar a discussão da psicologia da religião ao contexto contemporâneo e assim permanecer continuidade ao frutífero legado deixado por Oskar Pfister. Contemporary brings {{demands to}} the humankind. The religious experience is one among these many existing demands. It is undeniable that Brazil {{is going through}} a process of effervescence in this area. And this regards both religious and non-religious people. Due to that scenario, it is necessary to accurately investigate it, expanding and contributing academically with the area of psychology of religion. The Protestant pastor Oskar Pfister is known as an important scholar in the fields of psychology and religion. The aim of this dissertation is the understanding of the relevance and contribution of Oscar Pfister to the field of psychology of religion. In order to achieve that, an intense investigation was taken on the referred <b>author</b> <b>bibliography,</b> as well as on other correlative authors. In the first chapter, it was presented the biography of Oskar Pfister and his main epistemological influences. Its goal is to find out how Pfister builds his thought until his contact with the Freudian psychology. In the second chapter, the contribution of Pfister to the psychology of religion is investigated. Its aim is to suggest some pfisterian approaches to the religious context, as well as his legacy in the field of psychology of religion. In the third chapter, the dialogue between the pfisterian thought and the religious phenomenon is presented. Its purpose is to approximate psychological and religious subjects to each other, and to show how joining them together is crucial {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between these two areas. In the final thoughts, the author aims to reclaim the discussion on the so far established relationship, keeping alive the fruitful legacy of Oskar Pfister...|$|E
