25|$|Sunscreen {{appears to}} be {{effective}} in preventing melanoma. In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (<b>avobenzone,</b> zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In sunscreen, {{ingredients}} that absorb UVA/UVB rays, such as <b>avobenzone,</b> oxybenzone and octyl methoxycinnamate, are organic chemical absorbers or [...] "blockers". They are contrasted with inorganic absorbers/"blockers" [...] of UV radiation such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.|$|E
50|$|Complexing <b>avobenzone</b> with cyclodextrins {{may also}} {{increase}} its photostability. Formulations of <b>avobenzone</b> with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin have shown {{significant reduction in}} photo-induced degradation, as well as increased transdermal penetration of the UV absorber.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Avobenzone</b> is a dibenzoylmethane derivative. <b>Avobenzone</b> {{exists in}} the ground state as a mixture of the enol and keto forms, favoring the {{chelated}} enol. This enol form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding within the β-diketone. Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over {{a wider range of}} wavelengths than many other sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as [...] "broad spectrum" [...] sunscreens. <b>Avobenzone</b> has an absorption maximum of 357 nm.|$|E

50|$|Swimming {{pool water}} is usually {{disinfected}} by chlorination, bromination, ozonation or UV radiation. Upon {{the presence of}} some UV filters such as <b>Avobenzone</b> in swimming pools, toxic products are produced {{as a result of}} the interaction between <b>Avobenzone</b> and the active chlorine and UV radiation.|$|E

50|$|As an enolate, <b>avobenzone</b> {{forms with}} heavy metal ions (such as Fe3+) colored complexes, and {{chelating}} agents {{can be added}} to suppress them. Stearates, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates. Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. The makers of Coppertone advise that <b>avobenzone</b> binds iron and can cause staining of clothes washed in iron-rich water. The staining properties of sunblock made with <b>avobenzone</b> are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-tert-butyl-4’-methoxydibenzoylmethane, {{known as}} <b>avobenzone</b> belong to dibenzoylmethanes. It {{is one of}} the most UVA (400-320 nm) filters that are used in sunscreens formulations.It is sold under the trade names Parsol 1789 or Eusolex 9020. <b>Avobenzone</b> exists in two {{tautomeric}} forms: enol and keto ones.In sunscreen formulations, <b>avobenzone</b> exists predominantly in the enol form, which has a maximum absorption at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 365 nm depending on the solvent used. The double bond of the enolic form was shown to be more reactive in conditions of aquatic chlorination, than the aromatic ring.In chlorinated aquatic environment, <b>Avobenzone</b> undergoes transformation to two corresponding aldehydes and acids, as shown in the figure. Both aldehydes are formed as a result of the CO-CH2 bond [...]They are less stable in the oxidative conditions and easily transform into the corresponding acids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avobenzone</b> is {{sensitive}} to {{the properties of the}} solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the <b>avobenzone</b> to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>avobenzone</b> is {{considered}} safe, disintegration products may have significant health impacts and {{persist in the}} environment. A recent study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause <b>avobenzone</b> to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including aromatic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetyl benzynes. Some of these compounds {{are known to be}} cancer causing.|$|E
5000|$|According to some studies, [...] "the most {{effective}} sunscreens contain <b>avobenzone</b> and titanium dioxide." [...] <b>Avobenzone</b> can degrade faster in light {{in combination with}} mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, though with the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced. [...] A manganese doped titanium dioxide may be better than undoped titanium dioxide to improve avobenzone's stability.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Avobenzone</b> also {{reacts with}} boron trifluoride {{to form a}} stable {{crystalline}} complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. More interestingly, the emission color of the crystals relies on the molecular packing of the boron <b>avobenzone</b> complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called [...] "mechanochromic luminescence". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Tanners usually {{contain a}} sunscreen. However, when <b>avobenzone</b> is {{irradiated}} with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited {{state in the}} keto form which can either cause the <b>avobenzone</b> to degrade or transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects.It {{has been shown to}} degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time. The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{active ingredients}} in sunscreens are usually aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups. This general structure allows the molecule to absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays and release the energy as lower-energy rays, thereby preventing the skin-damaging ultraviolet rays {{from reaching the}} skin. So, upon exposure to UV light, most of the ingredients (with the notable exception of <b>avobenzone)</b> do not undergo significant chemical change, allowing these ingredients to retain the UV-absorbing potency without significant photodegradation. A chemical stabilizer is included in some sunscreens containing <b>avobenzone</b> to slow its breakdown; examples include formulations containing Helioplex and AvoTriplex. The stability of <b>avobenzone</b> can also be improved by bemotrizinol, octocrylene and various other photostabilisers. Most organic compounds in sunscreens slowly degrade and become less effective {{over the course of}} several years if stored properly, resulting in the expiration dates calculated for the product.|$|E

50|$|Chlorinated {{acetophenone}} derivatives {{are also}} formed {{due to the}} cleavage of the same CO-CH2 bond. Chlorinated acetophenone derivatives are tear gases, trigger dermatitis and some other health problems.It was reported that chlorination of the original <b>Avobenzone</b> into the aromatic ring position is less possible. The cleavage of CO-Ar bond results in formation of 4-chloroanisole.|$|E
50|$|Uses of Bar Keepers Friend {{that are}} not noted on its label include {{removing}} hard water stains from glass and windows and removing the brown or yellow stains caused by sunscreen containing <b>avobenzone.</b> The product can also clean teak wood, and serves to bleach it per the oxalic acid in the product, which aids in the cleaning process.|$|E

The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. Data presented to the Food and Drug Administration by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association indicates a -36% change in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include: ...|$|E
50|$|Their {{continuous}} {{release to}} the environment has prompted them to {{be considered as a}} new class of pollutants. UV-filters are not always stable under environmental conditions.Water in natural reservoirs is always subjected to sun irradiation, while swimming-pool water is required to be disinfected by chlorination, bromination, ozonation, or UV-irradiation. UV filters can undergo degradation and transformation to more toxic products. For example, <b>Avobenzone</b> undergoes transformation in the presence of chlorinated disinfection products and UV radiation to substituted chlorinated phenols and acetophenones, which are known for their toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|... 1,3-Diphenyl-1,3-propanedione (dibenzoylmethane, DBM) is an {{aromatic}} 1,3-diketone {{derivative of}} acetylacetone (acac), where both methyl groups in acac have been substituted by phenyl groups. It {{is a white}} solid melting at 77−78 °C. Similar to acac, DBM exists in two tautomeric forms, with the keto-enol equilibrium of DBM shifting strongly towards the enol form, particularly in non-polar solvents such as benzene. This {{is the result of}} the stability of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in the cis-enol form which is further resonance-stabilized by conjugation with phenyl rings. Due to its high photostability, derivatives of DBM such as <b>avobenzone,</b> have found applications as sunscreen products.|$|E
50|$|Ensulizole (INN; {{also known}} as phenylbenzimidazole {{sulfonic}} acid) is a common sunscreen agent. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration regulated that the name ensulizole be used on sunscreen labels in the United States. Ensulizole is primarily a UVB protecting agent providing only minimal UVA protection. The scope of UVB is 290 to 340 nanometers whereas the UVA range is 320 to 400 nanometers. For better UVA protection, it must be paired with <b>avobenzone,</b> titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide; outside of the United States {{it can also be}} paired with a UV absorber of the Tinosorb or Mexoryl types. Because ensulizole is water-soluble, it has the characteristic of feeling lighter on skin. As such, it is often used in sunscreen lotions or moisturizers whose aesthetic goal is a non-greasy finish. The free acid is poorly soluble in water, so it is only used as its soluble salts.|$|E
50|$|UVB rays cause {{short-term}} sunburn {{and skin}} cancer; UVA rays cause wrinkling {{and may have}} some role in development of skin cancer. There is no official rating for UVA protection in the US. In Europe, there are several different rating systems {{that are used to}} measure effectiveness in blocking UVA rays, including the IPD (immediate pigment darkening assay) and the PPD (persistent pigment darkening assay). The UVB range is 280 to 320 nanometers, and the UVA range is 320 to 400. Ecamsule protects against UV wavelengths in the 290-400 nanometer range, with peak protection at 345 nm. Since ecamsule doesn't cover the entire UV spectrum, it should be combined with other active sunscreen agents to ensure broad-spectrum UV protection. Ecamsule is a photostable organic UVA absorber, meaning it doesn't degrade significantly when exposed to light. This is in contrast to the widely used UVA absorber <b>avobenzone</b> that is not intrinsically photostable and requires photostabilizers to prevent significant degradation in light.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanochromic {{luminescence}} (ML) {{references to}} intensity and/or color changes of (solid-state) luminescent materials induced by mechanical forces, such as rubbing, crushing, pressing, shearing, or smearing. Unlike [...] "triboluminescence" [...] {{which does not}} require additional excitation source other than force itself, ML is often manifested by external photoexcitation such as a UV lamp. The {{most common cause of}} ML is related to changes of intermolecular interactions of dyes and pigments, which gives rise to various strong (exciton splitting) and/or weak (Forster) excited state interactions. For example, a certain boron complex of sunscreen compound <b>avobenzone</b> exhibits reversible ML. A recent detailed study suggests that ML from the boron complex consists of two critical coupled steps: 1) generation of low energy exciton trap via mechanical perturbation; and 2) exciton migration from regions where photoexcitation results in a higher excited state. Since solid-state energy transfer can be very efficient, {{only a small fraction of}} the low-energy exciton traps is required when mechanical force is applied. As a result, for crystalline ML materials, XRD measurement may not able to detect changes before and after mechanical stimuli while its photoluminescence can be quite different.|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) {{loaded with}} high {{amounts of the}} {{sunscreen}} agent, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (<b>avobenzone)</b> were prepared {{in order to reduce}} its photoinstability. The microparticles were produced, using carnauba wax as lipidic material and phosphatidylcholine as the surfactant, by the classical melt dispersion method or the spray congealing technique with pneumatic atomizer. The sunscreen agent loading was 40. 1 - 48. 5 % (w/w), with {{no significant differences between the}} production methods. However, release studies indicated that spray congealing enabled a more efficient modulation of <b>avobenzone</b> release from the SLMs (26 % of encapsulated <b>avobenzone</b> released after 2 h as compared to 60 % for melt dispersion). The photoprotective efficacy of the SLMs was evaluated after their introduction in a model cream. A statistically significant decrease of the light-induced degradation of <b>avobenzone</b> was obtained by the SLMs prepared by the melt dispersion procedure (the extent of degradation was 38. 6 %± 3. 6 for non-encapsulated <b>avobenzone</b> and 32. 1 %± 4. 3 for the microparticle-entrapped sunscreen). On the other hand, the SLMs produced by spray congealing achieved a more marked reduction in <b>avobenzone</b> photodecomposition to 15. 4 %± 4. 1. Therefore, the spray congealing technique was superior to the classical melt dispersion method for rapid and solvent free production of SLMs with a high <b>avobenzone</b> loading capacity...|$|E
