5|$|In February 1942, Lansdale, now a captain, {{met with}} James B.

5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> by January 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{annexation}} of Britain occurred {{about the same}} time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bombing</b> of Colchester is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.|$|R

5|$|As {{little as}} 15lb (7kg) of {{uranium-235}} {{can be used}} to make <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the Gadget used at Trinity) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (Fat Man) were both plutonium bombs.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb,</b> ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the U.S. {{government}} {{established the}} Manhattan Project, which was tasked with developing <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> The three primary research and production {{sites of the}} project were the plutonium production facility at {{what is now the}} Hanford Site, the uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|E

50|$|First Wave Complete Destruction is {{the debut}} album from punk rock band The Deadweights, {{released}} in May 1981 on Slash Records. The album's title is {{a reference to}} the 5 mile radius of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb's</b> explosion. The cover is a photo taken of the July 1946 atomic test, Operation Crossroads Baker, at Bikini Atoll. It is considered {{to be one of the}} most influential punk albums of all time.

5|$|In 1941, {{with the}} United States at war, Roosevelt authorizes {{up to two}} billion dollars for the Manhattan Project to develop <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> In December 1942, at the University of Chicago, under the watchful eyes of {{observers}} such as Colonel Jeff Nixon (Robert Walker) and international experts, scientists create the first chain reaction, under a stadium at the campus.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} Frisch–Peierls {{memorandum}} to Sir Henry Tizard, {{the chairman of}} the Tizard Committee, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.|$|E

5|$|By 1949, Soviet-backed governments {{had already}} begun seizing control {{throughout}} Eastern Europe, forming such puppet states as the Hungarian People's Republic in Teller's homeland of Hungary, where much of his family still lived, on August 20, 1949. Following the Soviet Union's first test detonation of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> on August 29, 1949, President Harry Truman announced a crash development program for a hydrogen bomb.|$|E

5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle.

5|$|The Congo possessed major uranium {{deposits}} {{and was one}} of the few sources of the material available to the Allies. Uranium extracted from the disused Shinkolobwe uranium mine, owned by the UMHK in Katanga in the southern Congo, was instrumental in the development of <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> during the American Manhattan Project. The director of UMHK, Edgar Sengier, secretly dispatched half of its uranium stock to New York in 1940; in September 1942, he sold it to the United States Army.|$|E
