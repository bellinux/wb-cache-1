5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

500|$|The {{first single}} from Matthew West's new album, [...] "My Own Little World" [...] was {{released}} on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Homer tells Marge: [...] "We were {{so close}} to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> so much time {{building}} that trophy case." [...] The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an Academy Award in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film The Killing Fields, was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story [...] "" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] that preceded [...] "These Are the Voyages..." [...] the actual finale of the Enterprise storyline. Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense {{to say that it was}} more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mountbatten {{admitted}} [...] "Edwina <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> all our married lives {{getting into}} other people's beds." [...] He maintained an affair {{for several years}} with Yola Letellier, the wife of Henri Letellier, publisher of Le Journal and mayor of Deauville (1925–28). Yola Letellier's life story was the inspiration for Colette's novel Gigi. Edwina and Jawaharlal Nehru became intimate friends after Indian Independence. During the summers, she would frequent the prime minister's house so she could lounge about on his veranda during the hot Delhi days. Personal correspondence between the two reveals a satisfying yet frustrating relationship. Edwina states {{in one of her}} letters. [...] "Nothing that we did or felt would ever be allowed to come between you and your work or me and mine– because that would spoil everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2003, Danish {{newspaper}} B.T. {{published an}} article based on accusations that the EBU television director Bjørn Erichsen made in reference to LTV suffering from organisational chaos which {{could result in the}} removal of Latvia's hosting duties since they were running behind schedule. The general director of LTV, Uldis-Ivars Grava, replied, saying: [...] "A few weeks ago, the EBU's legal director, Werner Rumphorst, was in Riga, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> an entire day with him and with the former general director of the Danish broadcaster DR, Bjørn Erichsen. We talked about co-operation and about programme exchanges, and neither of them said a single word that would indicate any doubts, lack of trust or accusation." [...] Ingrida Smite, head of press for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, reaffirmed that the contest would take place in Riga despite reports to the contrary.|$|E

60|$|There, at the Osteria del Sole, <b>I</b> supped <b>and</b> lay. <b>I</b> found {{a company}} of gentlemen in the common-room, who upon espying my motley--when I had thrown off my sodden cloak and hat--pressed me, willy-nilly, into amusing them. <b>And</b> so <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> the night at my Fool's trade, giving them drolleries from the works of Boccacci and Sacchetti--the horn-books of all jesters.|$|R
2500|$|As a youth, Appleyard {{walked into}} the {{bathroom}} of his home in Bradford to find the bodies of his father John, his stepmother, and his two little sisters Wendy and Brenda, in a room thick with gas. [...] At the subsequent inquest, it was stated that John had been greatly disturbed following the recent outbreak of World War II. Appleyard said that [...] "It is difficult even now to recall the details. I think I'd been spending some nights at my grandma's. She was on her own, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> {{quite a bit of}} time with her". In 1997 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bradford. He served as President of Yorkshire into his eighties, from 2006 to 2008., and was an Honorary Life Member of the club. Appleyard died aged 90 at his home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, on 17 March 2015.|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sri Lanka batted {{first and}} scored 251, before Ponting—batting at number five due to Steve Waugh's absence through injury—arrived at the crease with Australia at a {{comfortable}} 3/422. He started nervously, edging his first ball past first slip for a boundary from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh and was given out leg before wicket. Many members {{of the crowd and}} media argued it was an incorrect decision due to excessive height. He combined with Stuart Law, also playing on debut, for a partnership of 121. This was only the ninth ever century partnership by debutants in Test cricket. [...] "I've got mixed emotions about my knock at the moment. 96 is a good score {{but it would have been}} nice to get a 100", Ponting said after the innings. [...] "Once I struck a few in the middle of the bat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> some time in the middle I tried to relax and enjoy it, just savour the moment." [...] Australia won the match by an innings. In the second Test in Melbourne on Boxing Day, he scored a [...] "compact" [...] 71 in his only innings, combining for a century stand with Steve Waugh. He also took the wicket of Asanka Gurusinha in Sri Lanka's first innings amidst four economical overs.|$|E
