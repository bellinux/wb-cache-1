50|$|Singh Group {{observed}} tetracyclic enone isotope labeling {{pattern is}} consistent with the biosynthesis of the tetracycle via the non-mevalonate terpenoid pathway proposed by Rohmer et al. and Arigoni and co-workers. This pathway involves condensation of a thiamine-activated acetyl group arising from the decarboxylation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate followed by a transposition step. Since both pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (also glycerol) are part of the glycolytic pathway, varying levels of incorporations are expected. Thus, the terpenoid building blocks, dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, synthesized by the non-mevalonate pathway utilizing pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, condense to form the diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate that cyclizes to intermediate 3 which is related to (or derived from) ent-kaurene. Oxidative cleavage of the double bond of intermediate would result in the loss of the terminal three carbons producing the C-17 tetracyclic enone acid unit. An N-acyltransferase reaction of tetracyclic enone and <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> would lead to platensimycin.Because of the dissimilarity between plantensimycin's mechanism of action and that of conventional antibiotics, it is believed that the capacity for the development of resistance by bacteria may be substantially decreased.|$|E

Several <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> were chosen as diazo components and H acid, N-acetyl H acid, J acid and 3 -methyl- 1 -p-sulphophenyl- 5 -pyrazolone were used as coupling components. Red, orange and yellow coloured dyes containing sulphonic groups were produced and blue dyes were prepared by the reaction of the <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> with 1 -amino- 4 -bromo- 2 -sulphoanthraquinone. Yellow and orange coloured azo disperse dyes were synthezized by coupling the diazonium salts of the <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> with N, N-dimethylaniline, #beta#-naphthol and 3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 5 -pyrazolone. Blue disperse dyes were obtained by reacting the same <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> with 1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone. The CO_ 2 H group of various soluble and disperse dyes was activated by different methods, the best results being obtained with ethyl chloroformate as activating agent. Cyclohexylamine and lysine were used as model amines and the corresponding amides were obtained. The disperse dyes were applied to polyamide and wool fibres, after activation of the CO_ 2 H group and good levels of fixation were obtained. The fixation of the activated dyes was found to be significantly better than for the non-activated dyes. This result undoubtedly confirms the formation of a covalent bond between the dyes and the fibres. In spite of the apparent advantage of chemical bond fixation between the dye and fibres the application of this dyeing method presented some difficulties with certain soluble dyes.

The isocratically obtained Neue and Kuss retention parameters enabled the accurate gradient retention modeling for peaks eluting well within the gradient (mean error of 2. 7 %). The prediction errors for peaks eluting {{at the end of}} the gradient could be reduced from 8. 8 to 6. 1 % by implementing the isocratic regime after the gradient into the expression for the gradient retention factor. The prediction of the corresponding peak widths improved significantly for certain compounds and gradient profiles using individual gradient N values for each compound compared to employing a single N value for all compounds and gradient profiles. Two gradient optimization strategies (constructing the Rs map based on individual retention modeling and predictive elution stretching and shifting, PEWS 2) resulted in a reasonable separation of the challenging mixture of 13 isomeric hydroxy- and <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> on the ZIC-HILIC column. Overall, the optimization was limited by the steep decrease in N (dropping to the isocratic N value) and corresponding increase in peak width when increasing the gradient time. The discrimination factors d 0 were used to assess the resolution between peaks varying widely in height. The best separation was found to be obtained via the PEWS 2 approach. Both the individual retention modeling and PEWS 2 strategies corresponded to a total instrument time less than 12 h (including equilibration). Finally, it was found that the salt concentration had a significant effect on both the retention and the peak shape of the compounds, resulting in a small “solution domain” at 10 mM.

40|$|Nowadays {{available}} by clean industrial processes, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) possesses properties of nontoxicity and biodegradability which {{make it a}} true green reagent/solvent to devise syntheses that prevent pollution at the source. In particular, the versatile reactivity of DMC allows both methylation and carboxymethylation protocols that can replace conventional and highly noxious reagents such as methyl halides (and dimethyl sulfate, DMS) and phosgene. In the field of DMC-mediated methylations, representative examples are the reactions of DMC with CH 2 -active compounds and primary aromatic amines. In the presence of organic/inorganic bases or zeolites (faujasites) catalysts, these processes proceed with unprecedented selectivity (up to 99 %, at complete conversion) toward the corresponding mono-C- and mono-N-methyl derivatives, a result hitherto not possible with conventional alkylation reagents. In the case of ambident amines (e. g., aminophenols, aminobenzyl alcohols, <b>aminobenzoic</b> <b>acids,</b> and aminobenzamides), the unique combination of DMC and zeolites allows not only a very high mono-N-methyl selectivity, but also a complete chemoselectivity toward the amino group.

The dihedral angle formed by the two benzene rings of the diphenyldiazenyl ring system is 6. 55 (13) and that formed by the rings of the picrate–aniline ring system is 48. 76 (12). The molecule contains an intramolecular aniline–nitro N—H O hydrogen bond.
