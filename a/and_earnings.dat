In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 32. At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship between <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits <b>and</b> retained <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> the feasibility of reconciliation of the two accounts by outside corporate investors. Deductive conclusions are based on data derived from publicly available literature, seventeen <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits studies prepared by selected certified public accounting firms, and {{an interview with a}} representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Ninety-two potential transactional differences between <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits <b>and</b> retained <b>earnings</b> are analyzed <b>and</b> classified as resulting in no differences, timing differences, or permanent differences between the accounts. Corroborative inferences are drawn from the data developed from the seventeen <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits studies and from the interview with the representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ This dissertation concludes that <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits <b>and</b> retained <b>earnings</b> (1) only in extremely rare situations are equal in amount and (2) cannot be reconciled using publicly available information. In addition, the inference is drawn that retained earnings is not a valid surrogate for <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits. The consequences of these conclusions and inference are that outside investors are not receiving useful information about <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits and cannot generate that information. ^ The dissertation recommends that the United States Congress define <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits, that the Internal Revenue Service require calculation of the account by all corporate taxpayers on an annual basis, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board consider the issue of reconciliation of <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> profits <b>and</b> retained <b>earnings.</b> In addition, recommendations for future research in this area are offered. ...|$|R
40|$|Earnings {{management}} {{arises from}} a conflicting goal between agents and principals which basically means as managers’ intentions to manipulate accounting {{figures in the}} financial statement to achieve their own interests. There are two techniques of earnings management that are usually used by management: accrual <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of cost of earnings management on accrual <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> the trade-off relationship between accrual <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management. Using 14 publicly listed banks in the Indonesia Stock Exchange during period 2009 - 2013, this study shows that costs of accrual <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management have significant effects on accrual <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management. However, this study did not find the evidence that there is a trade-off relationship between accrual <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> real <b>earnings</b> management. The findings have implications regarding the use of costs of earnings management in considering type of earnings management’s decision in publicly listed banks in Indonesia...|$|R

Our major findings are:(1) there is a remarkable similarity in the covariance structure of <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> hours changes across the three surveys; and (2) apart from simple measurement error, the major component of variance in <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> hours affects <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> hours equi-proportionately. ...|$|R

5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well.
