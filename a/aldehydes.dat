40|$|AbstractStomach <b>aldehyde</b> {{dehydrogenase}} was structurally {{evaluated by}} analysis of peptide {{fragments of the}} human enzyme and comparisons with corresponding parts from other characterized <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenases. The results establish {{a large part of}} the structure, confirming that the stomach enzyme is identical to the inducible or tumor-derived dimeric <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenase. In addition, species variations between identical sets of different <b>aldehyde</b> and alcohol dehydrogenases reveal that stomach <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenase exhibits a fairly rapid rate of evolutionary changes, similar to that for the likewise ‘variable’ classical alcohol dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and cytosolic <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenase but in contrast to the ‘constant’ class III alcohol dehydrogenase and mitochondrial <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenase. This establishes that rates of divergence in the <b>aldehyde</b> and alcohol dehydrogenases are unrelated to subunit size or quaternary structure, highlights the unique nature of class III alcohol dehydrogenase, and positions the stomach <b>aldehyde</b> dehydrogenase in a group with more ordinary features...|$|R

The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|In organic chemistry, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} used as an oxidant, for example as an {{alternative}} to the Sommelet reaction for oxidation of benzylic halides to <b>aldehydes.</b> It has also found use in the preparation of isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamates. Because of its toxicity it has largely fallen out of favour, but it still finds occasional use, for example as a bromide scavenger during SN1 substitution.|$|E

40|$|During the {{purification}} of pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase by {{an established}} procedure [Flynn, Cromlish & Davidson (1982) Methods Enzymol. 89, 501 - 506] a second enzyme with <b>aldehyde</b> reductase activity may be purified. When {{the procedure was}} performed {{in the presence of}} 5 mM-EDTA, only traces of the second reductase, pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase (minor form), were present. By the criterion of sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase (minor form) had Mr 35 000, in comparison with Mr 40 200 found for pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase. Amino acid analysis of both enzymes and tryptic-peptide-map comparisons indicated differences in primary structure. The N-terminus of pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase (minor form) had the sequence Lys-Val-Leu, in contrast with the blocked (acetylated) N-terminus of pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase. The C-terminal sequence of both enzymes was the same. Both reductases were immunologically identical by double immunodiffusion and rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase (minor form) had 50 % of the specific activity of pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase when tested with a variety of <b>aldehyde</b> substrates. Michaelis constants of both enzymes for these substrates and for NADPH were similar, but values for kcat. and kcat. /Km indicated that catalytically pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase was the more efficient enzyme. Typical <b>aldehyde</b> reductase inhibitors, such as phenobarbital and sodium valproate, had the same effect on both enzymes. It was concluded that pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase (minor form) is an enzymically active cleavage product of pig kidney <b>aldehyde</b> reductase which is formed when the latter is purified {{in the absence of the}} metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA...|$|R
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, <b>aldehydes,</b> haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries {{to reduce the amount}} of environmentally hazardous waste. Lead is one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, <b>aldehydes,</b> and acidic gases.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give <b>aldehydes</b> and ketones, and {{symmetrical}} ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic <b>aldehydes.</b> The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived <b>aldehydes</b> and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
5|$|The Weinreb–Nahm ketone {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon–carbon bonds. It {{was discovered in}} 1981 by Steven M. Weinreb and Steven Nahm as a method to synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm amide, and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of <b>aldehydes</b> by reduction of the amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see amide reduction).|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} tyrosine residue {{in the active}} site of <b>aldehyde</b> reductase.

The role of <b>aldehyde</b> reductase tyrosine phenol group is {{to serve as a}} general acid to provide proton to the reduced <b>aldehyde</b> oxygen on glucose.|$|R

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid <b>aldehydes</b> and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, <b>aldehydes,</b> phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of <b>aldehydes,</b> gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E

5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise <b>aldehydes</b> and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
