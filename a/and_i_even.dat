My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Ian McShane {{was asked about the}} process of shooting his final scene where he is shown hanging after being killed by the Brotherhood, with McShane saying that the filming of the scene was [...] "very easy. You just have to hold your breath for 10 seconds and look sufficiently dead for them to get it." [...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
500|$|The first Mega Man game—released in 1987—was not {{successful}} {{enough to justify}} the immediate development of a sequel. According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had {{wanted to make a}} sequel to Mega Man, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it. Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game. [...] Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well. The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. The project supervisor of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel's development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time. In the previous title, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel. [...] "Working on [...] marked my second year at this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> got to mentor a 'new kid', which opened up a whole new world of stress for me," [...] Inafune recounted. The development time for the game was only three to four months.|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "July 1st" [...] was {{composed}} by Nagao and Hamasaki. Japanese disc jockey Cool-K also included additional scratching on the track. As H was released during the Japanese summer, Hamasaki decided to incorporate a [...] "summer vibe" [...] to the tracks and, according to Tomita, [...] "July 1st" [...] was her strongest song to feature this. These themes {{had also been}} explored throughout I Am.... The lyrical content is [...] "uplifting and cheerful" [...] and talks about fun experiences; Hamasaki commented, [...] "This {{was the first time}} I had ever written a song [...] from this viewpoint, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> surprised myself!" [...] "Hanabi" [...] talks about Hamasaki's views of the world, and discusses personal nostalgia. Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper, and Tomita commented that [...] "Hanabi" [...] {{was the first time he}} saw Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences, rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music. [...] "Hanabi"'s title was written in English characters, and is the Japanese word for fireworks. The title was re-used on her single & for the track [...] "Hanabi (Episode II)".|$|E
500|$|... "Sleeping {{with the}} One I Love" [...] {{revolves}} around Fantasia feeling torn between {{the stability of}} her boyfriend and the sensual pleasures of her lover. According to Wanda J. Coppage of Music Times, the lyrics focus on [...] "the {{story of a woman}} in search of love, but she seems to find it with the wrong type of men". Throughout the single, Fantasia [...] "candidly and guiltlessly" [...] discusses her affair by singing: [...] "I’m sleeping with the man I love because the one I’m with just ain’t good enough.” In the verses, Fantasia sings about her conflict with choosing between the two men, through lyrics such as: “Yes, I've tried to shake it off, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> tried to pray / But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me”. She expresses pain with the lyrics [...] "See my baby's like a dream, but the other man, he haunts me". Other lyrics also include: [...] "I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me...I thought about the cost, but it's a price I'm willing to pay." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Jewish {{circumcision}} ceremonies, a {{chair is}} {{set aside for}} the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at Mount Horeb (...) : Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on Mount Carmel. (...) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: [...] "I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>even</b> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away" [...] (...) [...] According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ( [...] and [...] ), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.|$|E
2500|$|Lee Norris portrays Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden, one of Lucas's oldest friends (they {{were both}} {{members of a}} group of {{children}} who played together at the Rivercourt, an outdoor basketball court in Tree Hill). Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth. Norris said that, during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. [...] " [...] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," [...] said Norris, adding that [...] "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and it's absolutely good to play that, because you feel good when you have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesn't always do the right thing, you know it's coming from a good place." [...] Mouth is unlucky in love.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same question <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote my first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jobs did not contact {{his birth}} family during Clara's (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his {{official}} biographer Walter Isaacson: [...] "I never wanted [...] {{to feel like}} I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out." [...] However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to {{spend a great deal}} of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that [...] "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble." ...|$|E
