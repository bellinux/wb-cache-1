40|$|Reversibly {{assembled}} microfluidic {{devices are}} dismountable and reusable, which {{is useful for}} a number of applications such as micro- and nano-device fabrication, surface functionalization, complex cell patterning, and other biological analysis by means of spatial-temporal pattern. However, reversible microfluidic devices fabricated with current standard procedures can only be used for low-pressure applications. Assembling technology based on glass-PDMS-glass sandwich configuration provides an alternative sealing method for reversible microfluidic devices, which can drastically increase the sealing strength of reversibly adhered devices. The improvement mechanism of sealing properties of microfluidic devices based on the sandwich technique has not been fully characterized, hindering further improvement and broad use of this technique. Here, we characterize, for the first time, the effect of various parameters on the sealing strength of reversible PDMS/glass hybrid microfluidic devices, including contact area, PDMS thickness, <b>assembling</b> <b>mode,</b> and external force. To further improve the reversible sealing of glass-PDMS-glass microfluidic devices, we propose a new scheme which exploits mechanical clamping elements to reinforce the sealing strength of glass-PDMS-glass sandwich structures. Using our scheme, the glass-PDMS-glass microchips can survive a pressure up to 400 kPa, which is comparable to the irreversibly bonded PDMS microdevices. We believe that this bonding method may find use in lab-on-a-chip devices, particularly in active high-pressure-driven microfluidic devices...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-stage}} fast Bayesian {{spectral density}} approach {{based on a}} novel variable separation technique for ambient modal analysis was formulated in the companion paper. In full-scale operational modal tests covering a number of locations, the dofs of interest are usually measured or processed separately in individual setups so that a set of local mode shapes are obtained. The difficulty on how to <b>assemble</b> these local <b>mode</b> shapes to form overall mode shapes is a problem not addressed in the companion paper {{that needs to be}} resolved properly. This study presents a theory to <b>assemble</b> the local <b>mode</b> shapes using the Bayesian statistical framework so that the data quality of different clusters can be accounted for automatically. The optimal global mode shape can be obtained by a fast iterative scheme, while the associated uncertainties can be derived analytically. The theory described in Part I and II of this work is applied to modal identification using synthetic data and field data measured from two laboratory models equipped with wireless sensors. Successful validation of the proposed method demonstrates the potential for Bayesian approaches to accommodate multiple uncertainties for ambient modal analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{report is}} the first {{systematic}} evaluation {{of the effects of}} prolonged weightlessness on the bipedal postural control processes during self-generated perturbations produced by voluntary upper limb movements. Spaceflight impacts humans in a variety of ways, one of which is compromised postflight postural control. We examined the neuromuscular activation characteristics and center of pressure (COP) motion associated with arm movement of eight subjects who experienced long-duration spaceflight (3 [...] 6 mo) aboard the Mir space station. Surface electromyography, arm acceleration, and COP motion were collected while astronauts performed rapid unilateral shoulder flexions before and after spaceflight. Subjects generally displayed compromised postural control after flight, as evidenced by modified COP peak-to-peak anterior-posterior and mediolateral excursion, and pathlength relative to preflight values. These changes were associated with disrupted neuromuscular activation characteristics, particularly after the completion of arm acceleration (i. e., when subjects were attempting to maintain upright posture in response to self-generated perturbations). These findings suggest that, although the subjects were able to <b>assemble</b> coordination <b>modes</b> that enabled them to generate rapid arm movements, the subtle control necessary to maintain bipedal equilibrium evident in their preflight performance is compromised after long-duration spaceflight...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{portrait}} film eschews biography {{in favour of}} the more elusive and emergent dynamics of subjectivity, this article explores {{the relationship between the}} off-screen duration of people’s lives and the duration of their on-screen performances of Self. Pedro Costa’s Where Does Your Hidden Smile Lie? (2001) is a feature-length portrait of the filmmakers Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, set almost entirely within the confines of a film editing suite. Just as Costa’s subjects are trying to reveal a hidden smile through editing, in this article I analyse the hidden time of Straub and Huillet’s professional and personal lives, time that cannot possibly be squeezed into a feature-length film (without recourse to biographical storytelling), but which can nonetheless be read as the very material that fuels the subjects that do emerge in Costa’s portrait. This article advances the idea of a polyvalent montage <b>assembled</b> from multiple <b>modes</b> of duration in particular, and argues that this kind of montage is capable of illuminating the complex trajectory of subjects in time. If the duration of subjects’ lives is largely and necessarily elided from the time and space of the screen, the screen nonetheless remains an interstitial space where such elisions beget new durational possibilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} fast Bayesian {{spectral density}} approach is proposed {{in this study}} to extract modal properties for the cases of separated modes and closely spaced modes. A novel technique for variable separation is developed so that the interaction between spectrum variables (i. e., frequency, damping ratio {{as well as the}} spectral density of modal excitation and prediction error) and spatial variables (i. e., mode shape components) can be decoupled completely for both cases. In a first stage, the spectrum variables can be identified through a so-called 'fast Bayesian spectral trace approach' (FBSTA) by employing the statistical properties of the sum of auto-spectral density, while the spatial variables can be estimated in a follow up second stage through 'fast Bayesian spectral density approach' (FBSDA) by using the statistical information of the entire spectral density matrix. This study also reveals the intrinsic relationship between FBSDA and 'fast Bayesian FFT approach' formulated recently when multiple sets of measurements are available. The newly developed two-stage Bayesian approach allows fora fast computation of the most probable values and covariance matrix of modal properties. The companion paper is devoted to <b>assembling</b> the local <b>mode</b> shape components corresponding to different setups to form the overall mode shapes using a Bayesian statistical framework and verifying the proposed algorithms through simulated and field testing data.

Although there have been advances in preparing 2 D materials that consist of {{one or a few}} atomic or molecular layers, bottom-up assembly of 2 D crystalline materials remains a challenge and an active area of development. More challenging is the design of dynamic 2 D lattices that can undergo large-scale motions without loss of crystallinity. Dynamic behaviour in porous three-dimensional (3 D) crystalline solids has been exploited for stimuli-responsive functions and adaptive behaviour. As in such 3 D materials, integrating flexibility and adaptiveness into crystalline 2 D lattices would greatly broaden the functional scope of 2 D materials. Here we report the self-assembly of unsupported, 2 D protein lattices with precise spatial arrangements and patterns using a readily accessible design strategy.

We find that a very specific combination of these large fluctuations plus the inflaton zero <b>mode</b> <b>assemble</b> into a new effective field.

We show how this reinterpretation saves the standard picture of how metric perturbations are generated during inflation and that the spinodal growth of fluctuations dominates the time dependence of the Bardeen variable for superhorizon modes during inflation. We compute the amplitude and index for the spectrum of scalar density and tensor perturbations and argue that in all models of this type the spinodal instabilities are responsible for a `red' spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations. A criterion for the validity of these models is provided and contact with the reconstruction program is established validating some of the results within a non-perturbative framework.

40|$|Compared {{to large}} {{established}} firms, technology-based new firms (TBNF) seem well placed to produce breakthrough innovations although questions remain {{as to their}} adeptness at subsequent exploitation. Building on the innovation and strategy literatures, the study identifies two different knowledge development approaches or modes (business models) in TBNFs – internal versus external - and examines their relation to breakthrough innovation and subsequent progression of the product to market. The internal <b>mode</b> <b>assembles</b> knowledge inside the firm to generate its innovations, whereas the external mode relies heavily on alliances to develop and assemble knowledge among firms embedded in a creative network. The study uses a unique panel dataset of 69 UK new biotechnology firms over an 11 -year period to explore this issue empirically. The findings show that the external knowledge development mode is associated with more breakthrough innovations and a faster movement of innovations to market. The externally focused mode is not impeded by its relative lack of internal knowledge; it uses partners to access, assemble and develop a wide scope of knowledge in a flexible manner. In addition, partners provide deep domain expertise to undertake the requisite deep-dives. In contrast, the internal mode has the huge challenge of assembling knowledge resources internally and suffers from a quicker onset of path dependence that impedes the generation of breakthroughs. This study provides a choice of business models (internal or external) {{that is associated with}} different breakthrough and speed to market performance outcomes. Going forward, policy makers and managers seeking breakthrough innovations and speedy progression of the innovations to market should consider the potential resource efficiency of the external mode and the vital role played by collaborations – small firm versus large firm and private versus public entities...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of Llanos del Orinoco, {{focused on the}} flooding savanna, is evaluated {{in terms of the}} change and replacement of the savanna ecosystem and the plant species distribution under a Landscape Ecological approach. This research is carried out at three spatial scales: sub-continental, regional and local. At sub-continental scale, monthly composites NOAA-AVHRR normalized vegetation index (NDVI) images were interpreted based on the phenology of savanna ecosystems in the Llanos del Orinoco region in order to produce an ecosystem map of the area. At regional scale, an analysis and description of the landscape changes derived from the construction of dikes to control inundation in the flooding savanna of the Llanos del Orinoco in Venezuela is presented. Elaborations of the landscape ecological maps were based on a land unit approach. An analysis of the landscape transformation derived from the embankment of the flooding savanna is carried out based on the savanna ecosystems replacement, Besides, the hydrological dynamics of the flooding savanna landscape was analyzed through the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the El Frio Biological Station as a representative area of flooding savanna. Field measurements were carried out with real time kinematic geographical positioning system and air photographs as well as radar images are used for further interpretation and modelling. The results were a precise digital elevation model, showing distribution of sinks and insight in the process of filling the area in periods of flooding. This DEM was used to obtain a Relative Altitude Model of the study area, and integrated to the soil water relative content field observation in order to produce single spatial models of plant species distribution in a changing flooding savanna landscape by effect of the embankment in the Llanos del Orinoco. At local scale, the direct and indirect response of vegetation to environmental factors of flooding savanna in the El Frio Biological Station area were analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) as direct gradient analysis technique and Path Analysis as indirect statistical technique. Data contain the frequency and cover percentage of plant species, physical and management environmental variables, remote sensed variables and mapping data from 37 sites. The first ordination axis was mainly associated to relative soil water content and the second ordination axis was related to grazing intensity. The hydrological dynamics and the capacity to accumulate water in the soil mainly determined the distribution of species in flooding savanna. Based on environmental-vegetation relationship, Gaussian logistic models were used to evaluate the response of plant species vegetation on environmental gradients of the area. The vegetation data collected contain information about the frequency and percentage of cover for 57 sampling units (sites). The result is that Leersia hexandra and Panicum laxum, which are the more abundant species, occupy different position into the environmental gradients. These results define the Ecological Model of plant species distribution. Finally, the analysis and integration of ecological processes into multiple ecological-spatial models were carried out in order to understand, evaluate and predict the distribution of dominant plant species in a changing flooding savanna landscape by effect of the embankment in the Llanos del Orinoco, Venezuela. The models using multiple spatial variables presented best accuracy than mode!s of single variables. The application of ecological integrated model of several spatial variables could be useful to analyze possible changes in the plant species composition on local, regional or global change scenarios.
