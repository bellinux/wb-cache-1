5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could <b>already</b> <b>see</b> many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could <b>already</b> <b>see</b> smoke coming from the building.|$|E
25|$|Martí as a liberator {{believed}} that the Latin American countries needed to know the reality of their own history. Martí also saw {{the necessity of a}} country having its own literature. These reflections started in Mexico from 1875 and are connected to the Mexican Reform, where prominent people like Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and Guillermo Prieto had situated themselves in front of a cultural renovation in Mexico, taking on the same approach as Esteban Echeverría thirty years before in Argentina. In the second “Boletin” that Martí published in the Revista Universal (May 11, 1875) one can <b>already</b> <b>see</b> Martí’s approach, which was fundamentally Latin American. His wish to build a national or Latin American identity was nothing new or unusual in those days; however, no Latin-American intellectual of that time had approached as clearly as Martí the task of building a national identity. He insisted on the necessity of building institutions and laws that matched the natural elements of each country, and recalled the failure of the applications of French and American civil codes in the new Latin American republics. Martí {{believed that}} “el hombre del sur”, the man of the South, should choose an appropriate development strategy matching his character, the peculiarity of his culture and history, and the nature that determined his being.|$|E

2500|$|Pozzo's artistic {{activity}} {{was related to}} the new (relative to Catholic Church's medieval monastic orders) Order's enormous artistic needs; since many of the Jesuit churches were built in recent decades and were devoid of painted decoration. He was frequently employed by the Jesuits to decorate churches and buildings such as their churches of Modena, Bologna and Arezzo. In 1676, he decorated the interior of San Francis Xavier church in Mondovì. In this church one can <b>already</b> <b>see</b> his later illusionistic techniques : fake gilding, bronze-coloured statues, marbled columns and a trompe-l'oeil dome on a flat ceiling, peopled with foreshortened figures in architectural settings. [...] This was his first large fresco.|$|E
2500|$|Communication in niches such as {{role-playing}} games (RPG) of Multi-User domains (MUDs) {{and virtual}} worlds is highly interactive, {{with emphasis on}} speed, brevity and spontaneity. [...] As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as EMPHASIS, usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in *stress* and the creative use of punctuation like ???!?!?!?. Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a conversational repair marker and arrows and carats as deixis and referent markers. Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. Virtual world language learning provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they <b>already</b> <b>see</b> such places as a [...] "natural place to learn and play".|$|E
2500|$|Comparable to Ancient Egyptian, Latin or Hebrew in {{the mystic}} {{traditions of the}} West, Pali recitations were often thought to have a supernatural power (which could be {{attributed}} to their meaning, the character of the reciter, or the qualities of the language itself), and in the early strata of Buddhist literature we can <b>already</b> <b>see</b> Pali s used as charms, as, for example, against the bite of snakes [...] Many people in Theravada cultures still believe that taking a vow in Pali has a special significance, and, as one example of the supernatural power assigned to chanting in the language, the recitation of the vows of [...] are believed to alleviate the pain of childbirth in Sri Lanka.

2500|$|Chamberlain {{joined the}} Nazi Party {{and contributed to}} its publications. Its primary journal, the Völkischer Beobachter {{dedicated}} five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the [...] "gospel of the National Socialist movement." [...] In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler {{as one of the}} [...] "rare beautiful beings...a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze", whose words [...] "always come directly from the heart". Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a [...] "Vernichtungskrieg" [...] ("war of destruction") against all of Germany's enemies. Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler-whom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes-that:Because he [...] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler-his courage!...In this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements...but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him [...] "the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft". I believe...we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not <b>already</b> <b>see</b> accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler...This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who sent him to us preserve him for many years as a [...] "blessing for the German Fatherland!".|$|E
