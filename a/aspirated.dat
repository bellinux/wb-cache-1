5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally <b>aspirated,</b> TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E

Tracheobronchial <b>aspirates</b> were {{obtained}} from 27 normal horses and from 57 horses with respiratory disease. <b>Aspirates</b> from normal horses contained mainly ciliated columnar epithelial cells, mononuclear cells, a few neutrophils and mucus. <b>Aspirates</b> from horses with acute suppurative bronchopneumonias or chronic bronchiolitis had predomi-nantly neutrophils and usually large amounts of mucus; in severe suppurative inflammatory diseases, many of the cells were degenerated, and there were coils of fibrinous material resembling Curschmann’s spirals. Eosinophils were rarely found, even from horses with histories suggestive of allergic respiratory disease. <b>Aspirates</b> from horses with epistaxis frequently had macrophages with intracytoplasmic green globules (hemosiderin). Tracheo-bronchial <b>aspirates</b> occasionally revealed subclinical lung disease. Four horses with no clinical signs of lung disease and lungs that were unremarkable on percussion and normal on auscultation had <b>aspirates</b> suggestive of inflammation; histologic examination con-firmed bronchiolitis.

5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally <b>aspirated</b> version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally <b>aspirated</b> unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{different}} staining methods for rapid analysis of transbronchial needle <b>aspirates</b> during bronchoscopy {{has not been}} explored. In the present study, we compared a Papanicolaou-based rapid stain, prepared by a technologist and read by a cytopathologist, and a Wright-Giemsa-based rapid stain, prepared and read by a cytopathologist alone. Gold standard was the final laboratory report issued on each <b>aspirate.</b> We harvested 827 <b>aspirates</b> from 218 target sites in 126 consecutive patients. At least one positive <b>aspirate</b> was found in 99 (79 %) patients. In those 99 patients, 288 of 574 (50 %) <b>aspirates</b> were positive for neoplastic (83 %) or non-neoplastic (17 %) disease. False-negative <b>aspirates</b> and target sites were more frequent with the rapid Wright-Giemsa than with the rapid Papanicolaou stain (14. 2 versus 7. 3 %, p= 0. 008, and 13. 7 versus 3. 6 %, p= 0. 021, respectively). The sensitivity of the Wright-Giemsa-based and Papanicolaou-based rapid stains for detecting diagnostic material was 93 and 100 % in patients, 83. 1 and 95. 5 % in target sites, and 72. 8 and 84. 9 % in <b>aspirates,</b> respectively. Specificity was 100 % for both methods in patients and target sites, and 90. 4 and 95 % in <b>aspirates.</b> We concluded that a Papanicolaou-based stain has superior yield and accuracy to a Wright-Giemsa-based stain for rapid on-site evaluation of transbronchial needle <b>aspirates.</b> Copyright©ERS 2010.

5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally <b>aspirated</b> four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Respiratory {{distress}} syndrome (RDS) is a {{major cause}} of mortality and morbidity in premature infants. By the time symptoms appear, it may already be too late to prevent a severe course, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality. We aimed to develop a rapid test of lung maturity for targeting surfactant supplementation. Methods: Concentrations of the most surface-active lung phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in gastric <b>aspirates</b> from premature infants were measured by mass spectrometry and expressed as the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio (L/S). The same <b>aspirates</b> were analysed with mid-infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, L/S was measured in gastric <b>aspirates</b> and oropharyngeal secretions from another group of premature infants using spectroscopy and the results were compared with RDS development. The 10 -minute analysis required 10 mu L of <b>aspirate.</b> Results: An L/S algorithm was developed based on 89 <b>aspirates.</b> Subsequently, gastric <b>aspirates</b> were sampled in 136 infants of 24 - 31 weeks of gestation and 61 (45 %) developed RDS. The cut-off value of L/S was 2. 2, sensitivity was 92 %, and specificity was 73 %. In 59 cases, the oropharyngeal secretions had less valid L/S than gastric <b>aspirate</b> results. Conclusion: Our rapid test for lung maturity, based on spectroscopy of gastric <b>aspirate,</b> predicted RDS with high sensitivity.
