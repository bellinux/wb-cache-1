25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords that I learned <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously {{it was a very}} personal thing.|$|E
500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the top animators like Tytla and Babbit {{were highly}} paid, {{they were all}} too aware of the low wages being paid to assistants and {{production}} people. Babbit even {{went as far as}} paying his assistant out of his own pocket. But in early 1941 Babbitt was fired for union activities. The day after Babbit led over 300 Disney studio employees in a strike, demanding union representation. To Disney's surprise and dismay, Tytla joined the strike line. [...] "I was for the company union, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> strike because my friends were on strike," [...] said Tytla. [...] "I was sympathetic with their views, but I never wanted to do anything against Walt." [...] The strike lasted over two months and was so divisive that it profoundly altered the course of American character animation. As the strike ended, America entered World War II and the Golden age was effectively over.|$|E
6000|$|... "So Marvin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to {{the next}} prairie section! Since they want the best men on the {{difficult}} work in the mountains, it means that we're passed over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I am {{in a large}} {{downtown}} drug store which is kept open all night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> duty after the day clerks leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|I don't think I {{can call}} these stumblings from {{conviction}} unbelief; the limping man walks {{for all his}} limping, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> {{in spite of my}} falls. [...] "Though he slay me yet will I trust in him...." ...|$|R
60|$|Betteredge {{took another}} note; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> issuing my directions.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me sharply but said nothing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> {{to tell them the}} details of the attack that had been made upon us, adding-- ...|$|E
60|$|She hastily {{returned}} to her room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> down stairs. In the hall, the servant was waiting for me, with a letter in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|Haney {{changed the}} current {{of all their}} {{thinking}} by saying to Bertha: [...] "If you are minded to go home, now is your chance, acushla. You can return with Mr. Fordyce, while Lucius <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to New York the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sair, I valk in de vood for de plaisir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> de bay for de--parbleu, non! 'tis {{to follow}} ma jeune maîtresse <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> de bay; <b>and,</b> sair, <b>I</b> wish dey who do love de bay and de sea, {{would not come}} into de vood, du tout." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{travelling}} together, just we two. We {{are wandering}} {{about the south}} of England {{on our way to}} Falmouth. Where I join a father in a few days' time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> with him to Paris. And if you and your friend are coming to the Old George--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{looked a}} little scared, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> telling her the dream. 'My dear' I said, 'I dreamed that I saw you happy with those children.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} interpose and explain. I {{was a little}} heated, I suppose, by feeling that he had doubted me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> bluntly, without waiting to hear him.|$|E
6000|$|Again he made {{no answer}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> [...] "And now, what about this journey to the north? If indeed I must make it, would you wish to {{accompany}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, it only {{costs the}} reader twopence," [...] she said, [...] "and {{they like the}} same thing over <b>and</b> over again. <b>I</b> just change the names and that's all. When I'm bored I think of the washing and the rent and clothes for baby, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not mind}} it now; I have shrunk to fit it. I began because I couldn't help myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> because, being an old woman, I have {{nothing else to}} do. Bless me, how I hated it after the first month! I must retire soon, now. People are growing weary of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I fancied once. I took up {{natural history}} in India years ago to drive away thought, as other men might take to opium, or to brandy-pawnee: but, like them, {{it has become a}} passion now and a tyranny; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> hunting, discovering, wondering, craving for more knowledge; and--cui bono? I {{sometimes}} ask--" ...|$|R
60|$|We changed again, and yet again, {{and it was}} now {{too late}} and too far to go back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me.|$|E
60|$|We {{went down}} to tea at the rest-house, where Stanley stuffed himself with {{sardines}} and raspberry jam, and beer, and cold mutton and pickles, when Garm wasn't climbing over him; and then Vixen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{bowed her}} head <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> 'In those wars I met {{a man who was}} named Teule, but who had another name in former days, so he told me on his deathbed some two years ago.' ...|$|E
60|$|My father {{listened with}} keen {{attention}} to every word, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> his eyes grew brighter and brighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will let}} you hear my attempts, if you like," [...] said Rosamond. [...] "Papa is sure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have heard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only once been to London. But our organist at St. Peter's is a good musician, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> {{studying}} with him." ...|$|R

60|$|Now, when {{my mother}} got to be eighty-five years old her memory failed her. She forgot little threads that hold life's patches of meaning together. She was living out West then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to visit her.|$|E
6000|$|... "O man, man, man!" [...] I says, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> {{my knees}} beside the bed; [...] "if {{your heart is}} rent asunder and you are truly {{penitent}} for what you did, Our Saviour will have mercy on you yet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but you see," [...] said I, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and {{explained}} {{the whole thing}} to him,--the advice of the doctor, the discussion about the proper place to go to, and the good reasons for fixing on this spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. I {{always bring}} it up when anyone begins to lecture and it works wonders. Uncle Mac turns pale, the aunts hold up their hands in holy horror, and a general panic ensues. Then I magnanimously promise not to disgrace the family {{and in the first}} burst of {{gratitude}} the dear souls agree to everything I ask, so peace is restored <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> my way rejoicing." ...|$|R
50|$|It's {{exactly what}} it sounds like. In the first part I talk about myself. It's a first-person kind of thing. It's not 'I had it coming' in a bad way. It's just like, 'Oh finally. It's about time I had it coming.' Then in the second verse I talk about {{everyday}} ordinary people caught in the 9-to-5. And they slip into the dream of those pressures being released from them. That's the whole reference to breathing under water. You can find that you can breathe. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to 'you've had it coming' 'Yay.' <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to say that we've all had it coming — might as well {{put it all together}} in one big fuckin' package — and the song's over. That's pretty much it.|$|R
60|$|Miss Dunross {{wrote the}} words, and paused in {{anticipation}} of the next sentence. The light faded and faded; the room grew darker <b>and</b> darker. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Kit smiled. [...] "I think not. To begin with, I'd sooner come here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> board Carsegarry {{when she}} called on her outward run. Captain Farquhar's kind, but I had enough. In another sense, so had Macallister and Don Erminio." ...|$|E
60|$|I calmed him. I {{assured him}} that I had never, in my own mind, doubted {{that he was the}} real and only assassin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and asked him what he had done with the body of the cornet-player he had killed.|$|E
60|$|The {{slamming}} of {{the outer}} door restored my sight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> contemplating the empty chair in the empty ante-room. The meaning of what I had seen reached my mind with a staggering shock. I seized Natalia Haldin by the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she called}} out to me, in a jargon I could not understand, {{something}} mocking and challenging. And her voice was raucous <b>and</b> challenging; <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> afraid.|$|R
6000|$|CHR. My brother, I {{did not put}} the {{question}} to thee, for that I doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but to prove thee, and to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart. As for this man, I know that he is blinded by the god of this world. Let thee <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> knowing that we have belief of the truth, [...] "and no lie is of the truth" [...] (1 John 2:21).|$|R
6000|$|... "I will try, sir. My father's {{last words}} to me {{were to be}} kind to mother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have tried hard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> trying." ...|$|R
