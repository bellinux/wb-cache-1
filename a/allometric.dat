Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively <b>allometric,</b> sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995).

5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} <b>allometric</b> scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on the margins of the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{dimensions}} of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider and therefore more advantageous diet.

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was <b>allometric</b> (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E

Recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the usefulness of brain size as an indicator.

25|$|Scale {{symmetry}} {{means that}} if an object is expanded or reduced in size, the new object has the same properties as the original.

Similarly, if a soft wax candle were enlarged to the size of a tall tree, it would immediately collapse under its own weight.|$|E
25|$|More recently, nest {{insulation}} {{has been}} found to be related to the mass of the incubating parent. This is known as an <b>allometric</b> relationship. Nest walls are constructed with an adequate quantity of nesting material so that the nest will be capable of supporting the contents of the nest. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. The flow-on consequence of this is that nest insulation is also related to parent mass.|$|E
25|$|In {{species of}} Lepidoptera, it {{consists}} of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube through which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest, and is extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced or even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families, and are often folded. The shape and dimensions of the proboscis have evolved to give different species wider and therefore more advantageous diets.

500|$|Although some {{morphological}} {{differences between}} the two fossa species have been described, these may be <b>allometric</b> (growth-related), and in their 1986 Mammalian Species account of the fossa, Michael Köhncke and Klaus Leonhardt wrote that the two were morphologically identical. However, remains of C.spelea are larger than any living C.ferox. Goodman and colleagues found that skull measurements in specimens they identified as C.spelea were 1.07 to 1.32 times as large as in adult C.ferox, and postcranial measurements were 1.19 to 1.37 times as large. The only specimen of C.spelea in which condylobasal length (a measure of total skull length) could be ascertained measured 153.4mm (6.04in), compared to a range of 114.5 to 133.3mm (4.51 to 5.25in) in adult C.ferox. Humerus (upper arm bone) length in twelve C.spelea is 122.7 to 146.8mm (4.83 to 5.78in), averaging 137.9mm (5.43in), compared to 108.5 to 127.5mm (4.27 to 5.02in), averaging 116.1mm (4.57in), in the extant fossa. Body mass estimates for C.spelea range from 17kg (37lb) to 20kg (44lb), and it was among the largest carnivores of the island.

500|$|There are no <b>allometric</b> {{differences}} among workers. On average, workers measure around this character distinguishes these ants from queens, {{as well as}} the different variety of colours they exhibit on their bodies. The head and pronotum range from orange to brick-red, and the mesonotum and propodeum are either light, same in colour or darker than the head. The gaster can be brown or black with blue or purple iridescence and the legs are either orange or brown. The iridescence around the foreparts is blue, pink, pale greenish yellow and purple. The erect setae are brown. The head has a concave posterior margin (as in the end of an organism from its head) with erect setae abundant in front of the face. The sides of the head are convex. Fully erect setae on the genal (side region of the head) are either present or absent, although a small number of setae may be seen around the mandibular insertion. The eyes are semicircular and positioned around the midpoint of the ants' head capsule. The frontal carinae (a keel-shaped ridge or structure) are convex and the antennal scapes extend beyond the head's posterior margin by two or three times the diameter. Erect setae are found all over the antennal scape and noticeably prominent on the clypeal margin (a shield-like plate at the front of an insect). The mandibles are elongated and triangular, with long curved setae around the head capsule. The pronotum is evenly curved with at least 12 or more pronotal setae present. These setae are mostly short and bristly. The mesonotum is sinuous (meaning it has many curves), and, like the pronotum, has 12 or more mesonotal setae. The mesothoracic spiracles are very small and the propodeal dorsum is smooth or convex. There are also a number of propodeal setae. The dorsum of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is thin, scale-like and sometimes vertical. There are both non-marginal and marginal setae present on the first gastral tergite around the gaster.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a hybrid}} {{scientific}} discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives. [...] For example, {{an understanding of}} physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or covariation (such as an <b>allometric</b> relationship) represents what could possibly exist or just what selection has allowed. [...] Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible {{for many of the}} traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as morphology).|$|E
2500|$|As {{with many}} other Salticidae, male L. viridis have brightly-colored and large chelicerae which are used as weapons in contests, and {{similarly}} colored forelegs that are waved during visual agonistic displays. [...] The corresponding appendages of females have more muted colors and have significantly lower <b>allometric</b> slopes than those of males. [...] When males encounter each other, they will wave their forelegs and often approach one another until one of them retreats, with a physical fight resulting if neither retreats. During fights, males press their chelicerae and forelegs against each other and push until one tires and retreats.|$|E
2500|$|Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often {{supposed}} to be far too large; in deer antler size has an <b>allometric</b> relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. Another example: camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colors [...] are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{disagree}} {{about the two}} main aspects of this theory, the pattern and the mechanism. [...] The primary pattern in question is whether metabolic rate scales {{to the power of}} ¾ or ⅔w, or whether either of these can even be considered a universal constant. [...] The majority view is currently that ¾ is the correct exponent, but a large minority believe that ⅔ is the more accurate value. In addition to disagreeing about the pattern, researchers also {{disagree about}} mechanism. Various authors have proposed at least eight different types of mechanisms that predict an <b>allometric</b> scaling exponent of either ⅔ or ¾. Some of these models make a large number of testable predictions while others are less comprehensive.|$|E
2500|$|MTE has {{profound}} {{implications for}} the interpretation of population growth and community diversity. [...] Classically, species are thought of as being either r selected (where populations tend to grow exponentially, and are ultimately limited by extrinsic factors) or K selected (where population size is limited by density-dependence and carrying capacity). [...] MTE explains this diversity of reproductive strategies {{as a consequence of}} the metabolic constraints of organisms. [...] Small organisms and organisms that exist at high body temperatures tend to be r selected, which fits with the prediction that r selection is a consequence of metabolic rate. [...] Conversely, larger and cooler bodied animals tend to be K selected. [...] The relationship between body size and rate of population growth has been demonstrated empirically, and in fact has been shown to scale to M−1/4 across taxonomic groups. [...] The optimal population growth rate for a species is therefore thought to be determined by the <b>allometric</b> constraints outlined by the MTE, rather than strictly as a life history trait that is selected for based on environmental conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the {{arguments}} for a ¾ scaling factor are based on resource transport network models, where the limiting resources are distributed via some optimized network to all resource consuming cells or organelles. [...] These models {{are based on the}} assumption that metabolism is proportional to the rate at which an organism’s distribution networks (such as circulatory systems in animals or xylem and phloem in plants) deliver nutrients and energy to body tissues. Larger organisms are necessarily less efficient because more resource is in transport at any one time than in smaller organisms: size of the organism and length of the network imposes an inefficiency due to size. [...] It therefore takes somewhat longer for large organisms to distribute nutrients throughout the body and thus they have a slower mass-specific metabolic rate. An organism that is twice as large cannot metabolize twice the energy—it simply has to run more slowly because more energy and resources are wasted being in transport, rather than being processed. Nonetheless, natural selection appears to have minimized this inefficiency by favoring resource transport networks that maximize rate of delivery of resources to the end points such as cells and organelles. This selection to maximize metabolic rate and energy dissipation results in the <b>allometric</b> exponent that tends to D/(D+1), where D is the primary dimension of the system. A three dimensional system, such as an individual, tends to scale to the 3/4 power, whereas a two dimensional network, such as a river network in a landscape,tends to scale to the 2/3 power.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the book}} was not what it seemed. In {{the view of the}} philosopher of science Michael Ruse, and in Huxley's own opinion, Huxley was [...] "a generalist, a {{synthesizer}} of ideas, rather than a specialist". Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were just adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful, and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating island biogeography, speciation, competition and so on. Huxley further showed that the appearance of orthogenetic trends - predictable directions for evolution - in the fossil record were readily explained as <b>allometric</b> growth (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with Homo sapiens as the end point, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the vitalist philosopher Henri Bergson, though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution. Huxley's belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about [...] "the future of Mankind". Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard's 1955 book on orthogenesis, The Phenomenon of Man. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.|$|E
