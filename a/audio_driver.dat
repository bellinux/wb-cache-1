25|$|After {{many years}} of development, today DirectSound is a mature API, and {{supplies}} many other useful capabilities, {{such as the ability}} to play multichannel sounds at high resolution. While DirectSound was designed to be used by games, today it is used to play audio in a large number of audio applications. DirectShow uses DirectSound's hardware audio acceleration capabilities if the sound card's hardware audio acceleration capabilities exist and are exposed by the <b>audio</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Applications {{communicate}} with the <b>audio</b> <b>driver</b> through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand {{the least amount of}} intermediate processing of the audio data or those that want to output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital, DTS or WMA Pro over S/PDIF. WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the audio device.|$|E

5000|$|First, the latency of KMixer {{is around}} 30 ms [...] and it cannot be reduced, because this {{component}} sits just right above the port class <b>audio</b> <b>driver,</b> so every audio stream, including those issued by DirectSound (except {{in cases of}} hardware mixing) and WinMM, come through the kernel mixer. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. Thus, if DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer is bypassed.|$|E

50|$|The latest audio {{interface}} is the SL4. It is {{the first}} standalone DJ interface with two USB 2.0 ports for seamless DJ changeover and back-to-back performances. It also has 96 kHz, 24-bit audio. The SL4 has built in galvanic isolation between USB and audio, with turn on/off muting.

25|$|Windows 98 {{introduced}} WDM Audio and the Kernel <b>Audio</b> Mixer <b>driver</b> (KMixer), {{which enabled}} digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams {{with a higher}} quality sample rate conversion as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware buffering, DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed. On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM <b>audio</b> <b>drivers</b> were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved.|$|R

Looney Tunes. González left behind his post as a graphic designer after the development of Astérix on the NES and Game Boy, and began to fully focus on music composition and <b>audio</b> <b>driver</b> programming during his time at the company. In total, González composed music for over 40 titles across 10 different video game platforms, including NES, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System, PlayStation and Game Boy Advance.|$|E
50|$|At {{the next}} level up, there are the device drivers, each one running as a {{separate}} userland process. Each one controls some I/O device, such as a disk or printer. The drivers {{do not have access}} to the I/O port space and cannot issue I/O instructions directly. Instead, they must make kernel calls giving a list of I/O ports to write to and the values to be written. While there is a small amount of overhead in doing this (typically 500 ns), this scheme makes it possible for the kernel to check authorization, so that, for example, the <b>audio</b> <b>driver</b> cannot write on the disk.|$|E
50|$|Loudspeakers {{are often}} built into horn-shaped {{enclosures}} or use horns. Most often the higher-frequency elements (tweeters and midranges) use horns, sometimes with acoustic diffraction lenses {{to spread the}} sound waves in a horizontal pattern at ear-level and limit the vertical pattern. An <b>audio</b> <b>driver</b> (e.g., a speaker cone or dome) is mounted at the small, inner end. Horn loudspeakers are very efficient, but have a sharp cutoff frequency, depending on their size, with little sound output below. Bass sounds are usually produced by conventional speaker cones, since a (straight or folded) horn sufficient to reproduce 20 Hz {{would have to be}} about 12 ft. (4 meters) long, except when a building, ground surface, or room itself is considered as part of the horn.|$|E

40|$|Voice over IP (VoIP) is a {{methodology}} {{that refers to}} the delivery of multimedia and voice sessions over an Internet connection and it provides an alternative to regular voice calls using phone lines, usually {{referred to as the}} Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) is an API denition for browser-to-browser VoIP applications; the denition acts as a foundation for applications using voice, video, chat, and P 2 P le sharing in a browser environment without the need of either internal or external plugins. To allow WebRTCto make calls to non-WebRTC VoIP applications, a initiation protocol (which is not included in the WebRTC implementation looked at here, i. e., the one released by Google) is needed. One such protocol is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is the standard protocol used for initialising, changing and terminating interactive sessions for multimedia today; it is particularly known for its use in VoIP applications. In this thesis, we evaluate the possibility of the creation of a WebRTC implementation using SIP (this type of implementation is referred to as WebRTC-SIP) that runs on an ARM A 9 processor architecture. The evaluation is split into two steps. The first step consists of analysingand performing tests of the Linux <b>audio</b> <b>drivers</b> on an ARM platform. The tests are used to determine how a WebRTC-SIP application could affect the <b>audio</b> <b>drivers</b> on such a platform. The second step involves implementation of a WebRTC VoIP application using SIP in a browse renvironment. The measurements done on the <b>audio</b> <b>drivers</b> show that they can cope with the CPU load created by a WebRTC-SIP application. Based on this and the knowledge gained from implementing such an application for use in a browser, two theoretically possible implementation methods are presented. The first solution builds on the WebRTC-SIP application done in step two, which utilises the support of WebRTC that is built into many browsers to power the application. The second solution is a application which uses a WebRTC to SIP gateway to allow it to set up calls to non-WebRTC applications...|$|R
