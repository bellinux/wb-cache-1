40|$|My {{thesis is}} about an {{analysis}} on the refusal of an invitation/offer/ request of {{the male and female}} Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado <b>and</b> those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya. The reason why she chooses this topic is that she is female Manadonese <b>living</b> <b>and</b> studying <b>in</b> Surabaya. She is curious to know whether male <b>and</b> female Manadonese <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado <b>and</b> those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya have things in common or not in refusing other friends? invitations/offers/requests. Furthermore, she also wants to know what kind of refusal that mostly used by the male and female Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado <b>and</b> those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya. She uses combining theories of refusal by Kartomihardjo and Beebe and Takahashi. In conducting her research, the thesis writer sets same role play consisting of five different situations each to male and female Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado <b>and</b> those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya. The role plays are designed to be {{as close as possible to}} the real life situations. After gathering the data, she then tried to analyze it based on the combining theories in which the thesis writer explains it in detail in chapter II. The result of the analysis shows that male and female Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado <b>and</b> those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya are similar in using positive expression type, using conditions (same as suggestion/ alternative/face saver type, and using "thank you" (same as thanking) type.

5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups.

5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a totalitarian state.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E

Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support.

Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E

It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku.

5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E
