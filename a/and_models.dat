5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms <b>and</b> <b>models.</b> In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
40|$|Background: The family, {{and parents}} in particular, are {{considered}} the most important influencers regarding children’s energy-balance related behaviours (EBRBs). When children become older and gain more behavioural autonomy regarding different behaviours, the parental influences may become less important and peer influences may gain importance. Therefore the current study aims to investigate simultaneous and interactive associations of family rules, parent and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with soft drink intake, TV viewing, daily breakfast consumption and sport participation among schoolchildren across Europe. Methods: A school-based cross-sectional survey in eight countries across Europe among 10 – 12 year old schoolchildren. Child questionnaires {{were used to assess}} EBRBs (soft drink intake, TV viewing, breakfast consumption, sport participation), and potential determinants of these behaviours as perceived by the child, including family rules, parental and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling.</b> Linear <b>and</b> logistic regression analyses (n = 7811) were applied to study the association of parental (norms, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> rules) and friend influences (norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling)</b> with the EBRBs. In addition, potential moderating effects of parental influences on the associations of friend influences with the EBRBs were studied by including interaction terms. Results: Children reported more unfavourable friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> regarding soft drink intake and TV viewing, while they reported more favourable friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> for breakfast consumption and physical activity. Perceived friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> were significantly positively associated with soft drink intake, breakfast consumption, physical activity (only <b>modelling)</b> <b>and</b> TV time. Across the different behaviours, ten significant interactions between parental and friend influencing variables were found and suggested a weaker association of friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> when rules were in place. Conclusion: Parental and friends norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> are associated with schoolchildren’s energy balance-related behaviours. Having family rules or showing favourable parental <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> norms seems to reduce the potential unfavourable associations of friends’ norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with the EBRBs...|$|R

V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, <b>and</b> <b>models</b> predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E
