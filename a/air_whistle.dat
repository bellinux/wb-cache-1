60|$|The {{engine was}} beating, the {{propeller}} spinning, {{and for a}} second the stage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally past Graham's eye; then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He gripped the little rods {{on either side of him}} instinctively. He felt himself moving upward, heard the <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> over the top of the wind screen. The propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic impulses--one, two, three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer controlled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibration that continued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from the face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking sideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw--a rapid funicular railway might have given the same sensations. He recognised the Council House and the Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight down between his feet.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Hancock model 4700 <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> {{intended}} for use on diesel locomotives ...|$|E
50|$|Hancock {{already had}} vast {{experience}} with whistles, and practically none with horns. Also, diesel locomotives were an emerging technology, and most early models were equipped with single-note 'honkers'. These horns {{were anything but}} appealing to the general public. Therefore, Hancock developed their line of <b>air</b> <b>whistles</b> {{in an attempt to}} romanticize the diesel locomotives. Production of these <b>air</b> <b>whistles</b> spanned from the late 1950s until the late 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|This {{was also}} the slow <b>air</b> <b>whistled</b> by Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid in the 1988 western film, Young Guns.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive steam {{trumpets}} {{were soon}} replaced by steam <b>whistles.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>whistles</b> were used on some Diesel and electric locomotives, but these mostly employ air horns.|$|R
50|$|The Hancock <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> was a {{railroad}} whistle {{intended for use}} on North American diesel locomotives {{in place of the}} standard air horn.|$|E
5000|$|No. D-1: Ex-US Army No. 1694. General Electric 80-ton {{switcher}} {{built in}} 1953. Arrived in 2003. Operable and in daily service. Formerly {{fitted with a}} Nathan K3LA, but was later replaced by a Hancock <b>air</b> <b>whistle.</b>|$|E
50|$|D-1 {{was fitted}} with a rare Hancock 4700 <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> for the 2011 season {{so it would be}} more pleasant-sounding than the loud, booming Nathan horn it previously. The whistle was rebuilt by the Rizzoli Locomotive Works in Niles, California for the 2014 season.|$|E
50|$|A {{single member}} of the class survives in preservation, E5001 is also in fully working order (although {{currently}} minus its 3rd rail collector shoes). As with {{the remainder of the}} class, the preserved example never received the standard SR horns, retaining its <b>air</b> <b>whistles</b> right up until being withdrawn.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>air</b> is <b>whistled</b> by Richard Dreyfuss' {{character}} in Always (1989).|$|R
50|$|The Hancock <b>air</b> <b>whistles</b> {{were all}} {{designed}} so that the bell of the whistle is horizontal when mounted on a standard horn mount. All the whistles are a single-bell chime, playing the notes E A C (A major triad) when blown on air. However, over time, many of the whistles got off-key and produced some variants. One common chord was E A C#.|$|R
5000|$|A train whistle or <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> (originally {{referred}} to as a steam trumpet) is an audible signaling device on a steam locomotive used to warn that the train is approaching, and to communicate with rail workers. Modern locomotives primarily use a powerful air horn instead of a whistle as an audible warning device. However, whistle continues to be used by railroaders in the context of audible signaling, such as [...] "whistling off" [...] when a train gets underway.|$|E
5000|$|Hancock offered three {{different}} models of their <b>air</b> <b>whistle.</b> The most common was the 4700, {{which consisted of}} the whistle along with a large, rectangular bowl in the same plane as the languid plate. This bowl, or , is used to project {{the sound of the}} whistle ahead of the locomotive, instead of [...] {{as in the case of}} most whistles. The second model was the 4700-2. This whistle is basically the same as the 4700 except that it has an electric heating element installed in the bowl to keep it from freezing. The final offering was the H4700, which did not include the reflector bowl. Aside from this difference, it is basically identical to the 4700.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, the {{railroad}} acquired a GE 44-ton switcher engine and three passenger cars from the defunct Yuma Valley Railway. The diesel {{has been given}} the number D-3, and began preliminary testing in April 2016. D-3 entered passenger service in June 2016 to substitute for D-1, which was out-of-service {{at the beginning of}} the 2016 season with an unspecified problem, before both locomotives began alternating. D-3 was equipped with a Hancock 4700 <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> similar to the one used by D-1, and was repainted into {{the railroad}}'s diesel and passenger car color scheme in July 2017. The passenger cars are in good condition, with two stored at Scales Siding and the third, the observation car Jersey Lil, is used as a diner at the Virginia City depot.|$|E
50|$|In early 1928, the TTC {{modified}} Peter Witt cars 2500-2522 for radial {{service on}} the Lake Simcoe line (former Metropolitan line of the Toronto and York Radial Railway). These cars were fitted with <b>air</b> <b>whistles,</b> large-flange wheels, and flag and marker light brackets. They were mainly used to handle heavy crowds from Glen Echo to Bond Lake. However, on one occasion some of these Peter Witt cars {{went all the way}} to Sutton to accommodate an Orangemen's picnic.|$|R

60|$|In an {{hour from}} that time Mr. Gilfil was {{galloping}} on a stout mare towards the little muddy village of Callam, five miles beyond Sloppeter. Once more he saw some gladness in the afternoon sunlight; once more {{it was a pleasure}} to see the hedgerow trees flying past him, and to be conscious of a 'good seat' while his black Kitty bounded beneath him, and the <b>air</b> <b>whistled</b> to the rhythm of her pace. Caterina was not dead; he had found her; his love and tenderness and long-suffering seemed so strong, they must recall her to life and happiness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrical}} supply {{available from the}} third rail—660 V DC—was identical {{to the requirements of}} diesel locomotive traction motors, enabling a fairly easy conversion to a dual-power locomotive. A DC electric compressor provided air for the brake system until the diesel engine was started. Two batches of FL9s were built; 30 locomotives (including the original test units 2000 and 2001, originally built with a [...] "Blomberg" [...] front truck, but later upgraded following testing) from October, 1956 through November, 1957 of [...] from an EMD 567C engine; and 30 between June and November, 1960 of [...] from a newer EMD 567D1 engine. The paint scheme as delivered was the bright McGinnis scheme of red-orange, black and white and the Herbert Matter designed [...] "NH" [...] logo. FL9s were initially fitted with the Hancock <b>air</b> <b>whistle,</b> a trademark of New Haven units of this time, instead of the standard air horns on diesel locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was {{the largest}} user of these whistles, and every FL9 {{purchased}} by the New Haven came from the factory equipped with a Hancock 4700 <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> on the roof in the front, and an H4700 whistle (no reflector dish) on the rear. Additionally, the NH's 40 Budd RDCs had two Hancock 4700 whistles, plus their Mack FCD-1 & FCD-2 railbuses, 30 GP9s, 15 RS-11s, 15 H-16-44s, 20 SW1200s & their fleet of Pullman-Westinghouse stainless steel MUs. One DL-109 was also retrofitted with a pair. Other railroads occasionally used them, notably the New York Central on some RS-3s, the Seaboard Air Line on their SDP-35s, the Cambria & Indiana on its SW9s, and the Minneapolis, Northfield & Southern. Unfortunately, {{it was found that}} at high speeds, the whistles were difficult to hear. Class I railroads eventually replaced their Hancock whistles with horns, namely for safety reasons. Short line users were generally steel mill railroads, where {{it was found that the}} whistle was easier to hear than a horn within the mill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station has}} never {{suffered}} ice damage despite it being {{located in a}} very exposed position; however the station was once abandoned and the light extinguished on February 11, 1936, because of dangerous ice conditions. It was not relit till February 24. In 1899 the station received [...] "new model fifth-order lamps." [...] A fog bell operated by gas was established at the station in 1923. The light was changed from oil to electric on November 26, 1929. The fog signal was changed to an <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> on October 24, 1932. In 1938 the light was described as having a Reynolds flasher to produce the one-second flash with two-second eclipse. A spare fourth-order [...] "wick lamp" [...] was kept as a backup. Oil was stored in a 225-gallon tank kept in the cellar. The fog signal was a number 4 Typhone Horn with an eight-inch-diameter whistle, which gave a three-second blast every 27 seconds. A backup Gamewell weight-driven clock mechanism produced a double strike every 30 seconds. The weight had to be rewound every hour and a half. The fog bell was a standard 1000-pound bell.|$|E
50|$|In early 1928, the TTC {{modified}} 7 double-ended ex-TCR cars 2160-2166, 23 single-ended Peter Witt cars 2500-2522 and 4 six-motor trains 1244/1170-1250/1176 for radial service. (A six-motor {{train was}} a coupled pair of 2 ex-TRC cars, {{the first car}} having 4 motors and the second having 2.) These cars were fitted with <b>air</b> <b>whistles,</b> large-flange wheels, and flag and marker light brackets. They were mainly used to handle heavy crowds to Bond Lake. However, on one occasion, such cars (including Peter Witt cars) {{went all the way}} to Sutton to accommodate an Orangemen's picnic, where the single-ended cars were reversed on a wye at Jackson's Point.|$|R

5000|$|Twenty-four {{examples}} of British Rail Class 71 (pre-TOPS type HA) {{were built in}} 1958 at the British Rail works in Doncaster and in 1964 ten were deemed surplus to requirements, withdrawn from service and placed in storage. The Southern Region was highly impressed with the [...] "little-ED" [...] JA & JB/class 73 locomotives and were keen to see a higher power locomotive with the same flexibility. In 1965, discussions were opened with English Electric (builders of the production JB/Class 73) to produce a high powered electro-diesel. Originally a centre-cab locomotive was envisaged similar in concept to the Clayton Class 17 but details on this are scant. This design was not pursued - possibly due to the historical frugality of the SR {{and the availability of}} the ten moth-balled members of Class 71. [...] meant that Crewe was chosen for the rebuilds. The redundant HA locomotives were moved in groups to Crewe where they were rebuilt into type HB/Class 74 electro-diesels. Buckeye couplers and high-level control & brake jumpers were fitted to facilitate working with other EP stock - especially TC units in push-pull mode. Also, two-tone [...] "raspberry" [...] air horns were mounted on the cab roof, replacing the original <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> of Class 71 locomotives.|$|E
40|$|Wide and disjointed, {{blending}} {{a fractured}} pulse with dynamic texture, {{this is an}} immersive and disorientating music, sometimes subtle, often invasive, always close. In capturing a moment and inscribing agency, the motionblur of the cover art offers a suitable metaphor for this duo’s musical interactions. Live sampled source sounds are gesturally manipulated and reworked within open ended narratives, sounding like an <b>air</b> <b>whistle</b> blasting out from an old steam locomotive as it emerges at speed from a tunnel. Whilst the whistle pig/groundhog (day) reference explores cycles of repetition beyond episodic improvisation, emphasising the value of revisiting and re-appropriating a previous moment. John configures the electric guitar as a site for multiple simultaneous points of interaction and queries the iconic cultural status of his instrument via feet, fingers and feedback. Robert crunches, growls and smashes both John`s live sampled sound {{as well as his}} private stack of industrial bits and organic beats...|$|E

A moment later, and the echoes rang, and the <b>air</b> <b>whistled</b> in my ears, as he slammed the door on his departing footsteps. The fury of the concussion gave me (had one been still wanted) {{a measure of the}} turmoil of his passions. In a sense I felt with him; I felt how he would have gloried to slam that door on my uncle, the lawyer, myself, and the whole crowd of those who had been witnesses to his humiliation.|$|R

[...] It was early and fresh, the <b>air</b> <b>whistling,</b> frost bright on the golden rod. As the sun warmed the world of stubble into a welter of yellow they turned from the highroad, through the bars of a farmer's gate, into a field, slowly bumping over the uneven earth. In a hollow of the rolling prairie they lost sight even of the country road. It was warm and placid. Locusts trilled among the dry wheat-stalks, and brilliant little flies hurtled across the buggy. A buzz of content filled the air. Crows loitered and gossiped in the sky.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{his work}} at the Music Room, Malchair took an {{interest}} in traditional ‘National’ music. He recorded the melodies that he heard in Oxford: including the music of military bands, the popular <b>airs</b> <b>whistled</b> by the townspeople, and the melodies of the singers and musicians in the streets of the city. He produced at least three volumes of collected music, one of which is in the collection of The English Folk Dance and Song Society. Malchair’s work provided the foundation for William Crotch’s 1808 work Specimens of Various Styles of Music. Some of Malchair’s own original violin and piano compositions survive in Crotch’s manuscripts, and owe much to the folk tradition. However, his most enduring musical work was a clock-chime composed for Gloucester Cathedral, where it can still be heard.|$|R

An internal reorganization in 1973 caused Lionel {{to become part of}} General Mills' Fundimensions group, and a new line of scale-sized freight cars, called [...] "Standard O", was introduced that same year. The new line of trains included the Blue Streak, an entry-level O-27 gauge train set produced by Lionel. The set included a blue Jersey Central Lines steam locomotive with a 2-4-2 wheel configuration and attached tender car. Lionel integrated several features into the locomotive, including a working headlight and a smoke unit. In 1974, Lionel began to offer trains in HO scale {{for the first time since}} the postwar period, where they were last cataloged in 1966. In 1975, Lionel introduced a 75th anniversary freight set whose rolling stock included images of train products and logos from Lionel's past.|$|R

His appearance had altered much {{in the last few}} months; he had become visibly smaller, his face in particular had become sharp and little-featured. It was more and more necessary for him to sit up in order to breathe with comfort, he slept sitting up; and his senses were affected, he complained of strange tastes in his food, quarrelled with the cook and had fits of sickness. Sometimes, latterly, he had complained of strange sounds, like <b>air</b> <b>whistling</b> in water-pipes, he said, that had no existence outside his ears. Moreover, he was steadily more irritable and more suspicious and less able to control himself when angry. A long-hidden vein of vile and abusive language, hidden, perhaps, since the days of Mr. Gambard's college at Ealing, came to the surface....|$|R
