IGN's Jose Otero found the inventory management system, which lacks <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> sort items, to be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E

Media companies such as Viz and Mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the American market. The growth of the Internet provided Western audiences <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> access Japanese content.

25|$|Chemical eye {{injury is}} due to either an acidic or alkali {{substance}} getting in the eye. Alkalis are typically worse than acidic burns. Mild burns will produce conjunctivitis, while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white.

25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures.

Locations include Liverpool, Holyhead and Birkenhead. The port carried 30.9 million tonnes of goods and passengers in 2007. 19.9 million tonnes of this {{was made up of}} material being imported and 10.9 million tonnes was material for export. The port also handles about 1.3 million tourists yearly. The port is only minutes from Dublin city centre and is accessed by a number of Dublin Bus routes.

25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. <b>An</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E

25|$|The Modern Defense, or Abbazia Defense, (3.Nf3 d5) {{has much}} the same idea as the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit, and can in fact be reached by transposition, e.g. 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 exf4. Black {{concentrates}} on gaining piece play and fighting for the initiative rather than keeping the extra pawn. It has been recommended by several publications as <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> equalize, although White keeps a slight advantage due to his extra central pawn and piece activity. If White captures (4.exd5) then Black may play 4...Nf6 or recapture with 4...Qxd5, at which point it becomes the Scandinavian Variation of KGA.|$|E

Also, Sever and his colleagues studied the teeth series and discovered E. junaluska possesses a longer prevomerine teeth series. In addition to these traits, a wavy, broken, black stripe up to 0.80mm wide extends from the nostril through the eye and through {{the sides of the}} body and tail. The front limbs contain four toes and the back limbs contain five toes. Nasolabial grooves are present and the number of coastal grooves usually ranges from 13 to 15.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E
