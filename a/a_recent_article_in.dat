2500|$|In 2004 President Thabo Mbeki made {{an attack}} on {{commentators}} who argued that violent crime {{was out of control}} in South Africa, calling them white racists who want the country to fail. He said crime was falling but some journalists distorted reality by depicting black people as [...] "barbaric savages" [...] who liked to rape and kill. Annual statistics published in September 2004 showed that most categories of crime were down, but some had challenged the figures' credibility and said that South Africa remained extremely dangerous, especially for women. In a column for the African National Congress website, the president rebuked the doubters. Mr Mbeki did not name journalist Charlene Smith who had championed victims of sexual violence since writing about her own rape, but quoted <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> which she said South Africa had the highest rate of rape and referred (apparently sarcastically) to her as an [...] "internationally recognised expert on sexual violence". He said: [...] "She was saying our cultures, traditions and religions as Africans inherently make every African man a potential rapist ... view which defines the African people as barbaric savages." [...] Mr Mbeki also described the newspaper The Citizen, and other commentators who challenged the apparent fall in crime, as pessimists who did not trust black rule.|$|E

England {{was then a}} simple country; we boasted, for {{the best kind of}} riches, our birds and trees, and our wives and children. We had now grown to be a rich one; and our first {{pleasure}} is in shooting our birds; but it has become too expensive for us to keep our trees. Lord Derby, whose crest is the eagle and child--you will find the northern name for it, the bird and bantling, made classical by Scott--is the first to propose that wood-birds should have no more nests. We must cut down all our trees, he says, that we may effectively use the steam-plow; and the effect of the steam-plow, I find by <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> the Cornhill Magazine, is that an English laborer must not any more have a nest, nor bantlings, neither; but may only expect to get on prosperously in life, if he be perfectly skillful, sober, and honest, and dispenses, at least until he is forty-five, with the [...] "luxury of marriage." ...|$|E
60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> La France, M. Sarcey puts {{this point}} very well. The further we advance, he says, the more {{apparent}} does it become {{that women are}} to take their share as bread-winners in the world. The task is no longer monopolised by men, and will, perhaps, be equally shared by the sexes in another hundred years. It will be necessary, however, for women to invent a suitable costume, as their present style of dress is quite inappropriate {{to any kind of}} mechanical labour, and must be radically changed before they can compete with men upon their own ground. As to the question of desirability, M. Sarcey refuses to speak. 'I shall not see the end of this revolution,' he remarks, 'and I am glad of it.' But, as is pointed out in a very sensible article in the Daily News, {{there is no doubt that}} M. Sarcey has reason and common-sense on his side with regard to the absolute unsuitability of ordinary feminine attire to any sort of handicraft, or even to any occupation which necessitates a daily walk to business and back again in all kinds of weather. Women's dress can easily be modified and adapted to any exigencies of the kind; but most women refuse to modify or adapt it. They must follow the fashion, whether it be convenient or the reverse. And, after all, what is a fashion? From the artistic point of view, it is usually a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. From the point of view of science, it not unfrequently violates every law of health, every principle of hygiene. While from the point of view of simple ease and comfort, it is not too much to say that, with the exception of M. Felix's charming tea-gowns, and a few English tailor-made costumes, there is not a single form of really fashionable dress that can be worn without a certain amount of absolute misery to the wearer. The contortion of the feet of the Chinese beauty, said Dr. Naftel at the last International Medical Congress, held at Washington, is no more barbarous or unnatural than the panoply of the femme du monde.|$|E
