500|$|In 2008, BBC One {{broadcast}} Mutual Friends, a six-part {{television series}} written by Anil Gupta, which {{was compared to}} Cold Feet. While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of Cold Feet, producer Rob Bullock stressed that [...] "Cold Feet is about a different period of life. It's <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> their early thirties. Mutual Friends moves things on—what's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different. Why do so many lives fall apart at 40? Because things haven't worked out how we hoped and we've had to turn to Plan B. The drama {{is all about the}} crisis caused by things not turning out as the characters planned." [...] Later in 2008, ITV commissioned Married Single Other, a comedy drama executive-produced by Andy Harries and directed by Declan Lowney, about three contemporary couples living in Leeds.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a cold and emotionless man. In the first verse, Madonna enters in a medium range, 'You only see what your eyes want to see'. In the chorus, dance rhythm and ambient sounds are added. In the second verse, more visceral lyrics are added, like 'Love is a bird, she needs to fly'. During the bridge, a broad, string lines provide {{instrumental}} commentary on the lyrics. The song ends with a string ostinato that simply fades away, without fully resolving to the tonic chord. In an interview with The New York Times, Madonna commented that the lyrics to [...] "Frozen" [...] is built around [...] "Retaliation, revenge, hate, regret, that's what I deal with in [...] "Frozen". Everyone's going to say, 'That's a song about Carlos' , but it's not really; it's just <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> general".|$|E

500|$|Born in 1926, Harper Lee {{grew up in}} the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, {{where she}} became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer [...] Truman Capote. She {{attended}} Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.|$|E

The songs [...] "Stranger" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Woman", despite speculation {{that they were}} written about Madden's then-new girlfriend Nicole Richie, were actually written about Duff's father's affair. She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom must feel around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it seem like {{it was about a}} relationship I was in, because I didn't want people to know about my parents. But I've realized that so many people can relate to what I've gone through." [...] The album's title track has also been reported to be about Richie, though Duff did not deny rumors that it was. [...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E
