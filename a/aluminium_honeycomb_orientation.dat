In the experiments, a testing platform was design {{to compare the}} shock absorption level of different honeycomb specimens quantitatively. The shock response curves of six test points mounted on the platform were recorded with acceleration sensors when the buffer was impacted by a bullet driven by high pressure gas. The maximum acceleration values in time domain and in specifically spectral domain were obtained based on spectral analysis. Comparing the data of combined <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycomb</b> buffer and single <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycomb</b> buffer, conclusion can be obtained that shock absorbing characteristic of combined <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycomb</b> buffer is better. Furthermore, compression properties of three kinds of buffers were tested under quasi-static state. The energy absorption parameters were calculated.

40|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>honeycombs</b> is a {{lightweight}} cellular material {{and a good}} energy absorber. In different engineering applications, it is usually used as structural components. Comprehensive study has been conducted to analyse the compressive behaviour of <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycombs.</b> However, research related to mechanical response of <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycombs</b> material subjected to different type of loadings, such as indentation, is still limited. In this paper, experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the deformation mechanism and energy dissipation of a HEXCELL® <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycomb</b> subjected to dynamic indentation. A high speed INSTRON machine was used to conduct dynamic tests at velocities of 0. 5 m/s and 5 m/s. Numerical analysis was conducted using ANSYS LS-DYNA at velocities of 5 m/s, 15 m/s and 25 m/s. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results in terms of stress-strain curve profile and deformation mode. In the experiment, {{it was found that}} with the increase of velocity (strain rate) the average plateau stress of indentation also increases which was validated in the numerical analysis. The deformation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycombs</b> under indentation showed that the compression of hexagonal honeycomb cells under the indenter and also tearing of honeycomb cell walls along the four edges of the indenter.

Quasi-static compressive tests {{were performed on}} seven types of HEXCEL <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycombs</b> with different cell size and wall thickness. The deformed layers produced 'X’ shaped bands in honeycomb samples when crushed in the X 1 direction, while the deformed layers were almost perpendicular to the loading direction when crushed in the X 2 direction.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIHoneycomb {{sandwich}} structures {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications. Nevertheless, because of manufacturing defects or impact loads, these structures can experience imperfect bonding or debonding between the skin and the honeycomb core. Instances of debonding reduce the bending stiffness of the composite panel, which causes detectable changes in its vibration characteristics. This article presents a new methodology to identify debonded regions in <b>aluminium</b> <b>honeycomb</b> panels that uses an inverse algorithm based on parallel genetic algorithms. The honeycomb panels are modelled with finite elements using a simplified three-layer shell model. The adhesive layer between the skin and core is modelled using linear springs, with reduced rigidity for the debonded sectors.
