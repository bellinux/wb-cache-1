While the book's {{storytelling}} virtues are enormous, you don't {{have to be}} a bluestocking of political correctness to find some of this fantasy anti-Arab, or anti-Eastern, or anti-Ottoman.

The farmer Wilks still has a horse and cart. However the taxi driver was a ploughman fifteen years before, and the local smithy is now a garage and petrol station. The bus, the train and walking are still preferred methods of travel for the majority, though, and even the car-owning gentry at the Georgian House are familiar with public transport timetables.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Penderecki was {{commissioned}} by Solidarity to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the Gdańsk shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with Lacrimosa, which he later expanded {{into one of the}} best known works of his later period, the Polish Requiem (1980–84, 1993, 2005). Again the harmonies are rich, although there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> which recall his work in the 1960s. In recent years, he has tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the Credo.

25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E

But it never settles into a single confident idiom, and between the big numbers there are lulls, especially in the overlong first half."

After suffering years of domestic abuse at his hands, Mariam bludgeons Rasheed {{to death with}} a shovel during a violent struggle. Hosseini stated that he hoped to create a multi-layered character in Rasheed, saying, [...] "Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to write him as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> of humanity, such as his love for his son."

500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E
500|$|At the Paley Festival Glee {{panel in}} March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana {{would be seen}} to make out during the show's first season.

Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were [...] "organic and natural." [...] While there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: [...] "that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and being really close. It's always her and I just messing around and they end up using it." ...|$|E

[...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking.

I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said.

500|$|Upon its release, {{consumer}} {{magazines and}} newspapers generally gave Gone with the Wind excellent reviews. However, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while {{it was the most}} ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an [...] "interesting story beautifully told". Franz Hoellering of The Nation was of the same opinion: [...] "The result is a film which is a major event {{in the history of the}} industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art.

Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films.
