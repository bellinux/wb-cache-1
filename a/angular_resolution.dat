5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has {{adequate}} <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> {{to separate}} {{the light from the}} moons from that of Haumea. Photometry of the Haumea triple system with HST's NICMOS camera has confirmed that the spectral line at 1.6µm that indicates the presence of water ice is at least as strong in the moons' spectra as in Haumea's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The hard X-ray and {{low-energy}} gamma-ray SIGMA {{telescope was}} {{a collaboration between}} CESR (Toulouse) and CEA (Saclay). It covered the energy range 35–1300keV, with an effective area of 800cm2 and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5°5°. The maximum <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> was 15arcmin. The energy resolution was 8% at 511keV. Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.|$|E
50|$|The highest <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> can be {{achieved}} by arrays of telescopes called astronomical interferometers: These instruments can achieve <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> of 0.001 arcsecond at optical wavelengths, and much higher resolutions at radio wavelengths. In order to perform aperture synthesis imaging, a large number of telescopes are required laid out in a 2-dimensional arrangement.|$|R

50|$|For the {{autonomous}} applications a lidar with a 3D scanner {{is used for}} obstacle detection and collision avoidance. The scanner measures radial distance at different <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions.</b> The lidar emits a single laser ray and uses an interior rotating mirror to distribute the laser ray covering a large field of view.|$|R
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E
5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher <b>angular</b> <b>resolution.</b> VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{to fulfill}} the science targets of the {{low-energy}} electron observation, measurement requirements of the LEPe instrument are: (1) measurement energy range from a few tens eV to ∼ 20  keV, (2) three-dimensional flux measurement with <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> of ∼ 22.5  deg, and (3) fine angular measurement with a resolution less than several degrees.|$|R

It used four telescopes, {{three of which}} were purpose-built 2nbsp&m ones with the other being the 7nbsp&m Crawford Hill telescope used for CAPMAP. As a result, it will have <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> between a few arcminutes and several degrees. The detectors are mass-produced coherent correlation polarimeters.|$|R
30|$|Successful muon radiographies of volcanoes were {{obtained}} by means of plastic scintillator telescopes (Tanaka et al., 2005; Tanaka and Yokoyama, 2008). They were made of 8 to 10 cm wide plastic scintillator strips, covering a total area of approximately 1 m 2 and providing <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> down to 40 mrad. Each strip was read out by a photomultiplier through a light guide.|$|R
25|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>resolution</b> is {{a measure}} of the sharpest angles in a graph drawing. If a graph has {{vertices}} with high degree then it necessarily will have small <b>angular</b> <b>resolution,</b> but the <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> can be bounded below by a function of the degree.|$|E
25|$|The maximum <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of {{the human}} eye at a {{distance}} of 1km is typically 30 to 60cm. This gives an <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of between 0.02 and 0.03 degrees, which is roughly 1.2–1.8 arc minutes per line pair, which implies a pixel spacing of 0.6–0.9 arc minutes.|$|E
25|$|This {{aliasing}} {{is visible}} in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low <b>angular</b> <b>resolution,</b> then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of the image (and, for frequency, {{the speed of the}} viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (SARPES) apparatus with a vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) laser (hν= 6. 994 eV) {{developed at the}} Laser and Synchrotron Research Center at the Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo. The spectrometer consists of a hemispherical photoelectron analyzer equipped with an electron deflector function and twin very-low-energy-electron-diffraction-type spin detectors, which allows us to analyze the spin vector of a photoelectron three-dimensionally with both high energy and <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions.</b> The combination of the high-performance spectrometer and the high-photon-flux VUV laser can achieve an energy resolution of 1. 7 meV for SARPES. We demonstrate that the present laser-SARPES machine realizes a quick SARPES on the spin-split band structure of a Bi(111) film even with 7 meV energy and 0. 7 ^∘ <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> along the entrance-slit direction. This laser-SARPES machine is applicable to the investigation of spin-dependent electronic states on an energy scale of a few meV. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of two portable fl-ray vision systems, {{which could be}} transported by a robot, have been explored and compared. The detector of the first system (CSPMT) consists of an array of 37 CsI(Na) scintillation crystals viewed by a single 5 inch diameter positionsensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT), while the second system (CSPD) employs an array of 40 CsI(Tl) scintillation detectors coupled to PIN silicon photodiodes. These devices are designed {{to operate in the}} energy range from 70 keV to 1. 5 MeV, which encompasses most energies of fl-ray radiation from the radioactive nuclides of interest to the nuclear industry. These systems have good <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> of about 3 ffi FWHM at the central field of view of 10 ffi Θ 10 ffi or better when image reconstruction is employed, and coarser <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> of about 10 ffi FWHM elsewhere within a wide field of view of 50 ffi Θ 50 ffi.

25|$|The WMAP was {{preceded by}} two {{missions}} to observe the CMB; (i) the Soviet RELIKT-1 that reported the upper-limit measurements of CMB anisotropies, and (ii) the U.S. COBE satellite that first reported large-scale CMB fluctuations. The WMAP was 45 times more sensitive, with 33 times the <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of its COBE satellite predecessor. The successor European Planck mission (operational 2009-2013) had a higher resolution and higher sensitivity than WMAP and observed in 9 frequency bands rather than WMAP's 5, allowing improved astrophysical foreground models.|$|E
25|$|Lunar transits {{have been}} used to map X-ray {{emissions}} from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally had quite low <b>angular</b> <b>resolution,</b> but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula's brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab Nebula, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} of large ground-based optical and infrared telescopes will provide new challenges for designers of astronomical instrumentation. The varied science cases for these extremely large telescopes (ELTs) require a large range of <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions,</b> from near diffraction-limited performance via correction of atmospheric turbulence using adaptive optics (AO), to seeing-limited observations. Moreover, the scientific output of the telescopes must also be optimized with the consideration that, with current technology, AO is relatively ineffective at visible wavelengths, and that atmospheric conditions will often preclude high-performance AO. This paper explores {{some of the issues}} that arise when designing ELT instrumentation that operates across a range of <b>angular</b> <b>resolutions</b> and wavelengths. We show that instruments designed for seeing-limited or seeing-enhanced observations have particular challenges in terms of size and mass, while diffraction-limited instruments are not as straightforward as might be imagined.

25|$|Again, {{this happens}} with {{electrons}} before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167nm, which was {{long enough to}} exhibit a single diffraction side lobe when reflecting {{from the face of}} a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215nm. With a larger vacuum chamber, it would seem relatively easy to increase the <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited <b>angular</b> <b>resolution.</b> Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that {{we were interested in}} was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent to that of the human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E
25|$|A visual {{binary star}} is a binary star {{for which the}} angular {{separation}} between the two components is great enough to permit them to be observed as a double star in a telescope, or even high-powered binoculars. The <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of the telescope {{is an important factor}} in the detection of visual binaries, and as better angular resolutions are applied to binary star observations increasing number of visual binaries will be detected. The relative brightness of the two stars is also an important factor, as glare from a bright star may make it difficult to detect the presence of a fainter component.|$|E

25|$|The high-energy {{focusing}} telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical {{sources in the}} hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band. Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of HEFT is ~1.5'. Rather than using a grazing-angle X-ray telescope, HEFT makes use of a novel tungsten-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV full width at half maximum at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005.

25|$|The radio {{telescope}} comprises 27 independent antennae, {{each of which}} has a dish diameter of 25meters (82feet) and weighs 209 metric tons (230 Short tons). The antennae are distributed along the three arms of a track, shaped in a wye (or Y) -configuration, (each of which measures 21km/13miles long). Using the rail tracks that follow each of these arms—and that, at one point, intersect with U.S. Route 60 at a level crossing—and a specially designed lifting locomotive ("Hein's Trein"), the antennas can be physically relocated to a number of prepared positions, allowing aperture synthesis interferometry with up to 351 independent baselines: in essence, the array acts as a single antenna with a variable diameter. The <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> that can be reached is between 0.2 and 0.04 arcseconds.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} absorbed {{high in the}} Earth's {{atmosphere}} so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with satellites. Gamma-ray telescopes use scintillation counters, spark chambers and more recently, solid-state detectors. The <b>angular</b> <b>resolution</b> of these devices is typically very poor. There were balloon-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with {{the launch of the}} OSO 3 satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were SAS B (1972) and Cos B (1975). The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200GeV) can be detected from the ground via the Cerenkov radiation produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the HEGRA (1987), STACEE (2001), HESS (2003), and MAGIC (2004).|$|E
