5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, {{they could not be}} taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E
5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, {{located in}} Belgium {{and led by}} Paul Otlet, {{contacted}} Dewey {{about the possibility of}} translating the classification into French, and using the classification system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission {{for the creation of a}} version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal. The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today.|$|E
40|$|Contextuality and nonlocality are two {{fundamental}} properties of nature. Hardy's proof {{is considered the}} simplest proof of nonlocality and {{can also be seen}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the simplest Bell inequality. A fundamental question is: Which is the simplest proof of contextuality? We show that there is a Hardy-like proof of contextuality that can also be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the simplest noncontextuality inequality. Interestingly, this new proof connects this inequality with the proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem, providing the missing link between these {{two fundamental}} results, and can be extended to an arbitrary odd number $n$ of settings, an extension that can be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the $n$-cycle inequality.

5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were {{to be put in}} escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July, {{less than}} twelve {{hours before the}} book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail {{newspaper}} that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog; Richard Stallman called for a boycott, requesting the publisher issue an apology. The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning. Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} in the saga of German {{unification}} under Bismarck came with the Schleswig-Holstein Question. On 15 November 1863, King Christian IX of Denmark became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig and Holstein. On 18 November 1863, he signed the Danish November Constitution and declared the Duchy of Schleswig a part of Denmark. The German Confederation saw this act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the London Protocol of 1852, which emphasized {{the status of the}} kingdom of Denmark as distinct from the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The populations of Schleswig and Holstein, furthermore, greatly valued this separate status. The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of these duchies as a rallying cry: large portions of both Schleswig and Holstein were of German origin and spoke German in everyday life (though Schleswig had a sizable Danish minority). Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed, and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the border into Schleswig on 1 February 1864. Initially, the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the Danevirke, but this proved futile. The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces, and they could not rely on help from their allies in the other Scandinavian states because Denmark had nullified its alliance rights by violating the London Protocol. The Needle Gun, one of the first bolt action rifles to be used in conflict, aided the Prussians in both this war and the Austro-Prussian War two years later. The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone, while its muzzle-loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing. The Second Schleswig War resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria, and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding peace of Vienna, signed on 30 October 1864.|$|E
