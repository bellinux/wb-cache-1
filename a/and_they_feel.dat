The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E

Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E

"Fly on the Wall" [...] is {{prominently}} an electropop {{song that}} is also composed {{of a number of}} hooks, which yell the song's title, while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars. Unlike other songs on Breakout, [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] has Cyrus' voice processed to sound different. The song's lyrics taunt [...] "the listener for being on the outside of her inner sanctum". The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex-boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to. [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music. The backdrop for the [...] "feel-bad" [...] love song features ocean wave sounds. The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention". In the first verse, she [...] "admits that she doesn't know exactly what's up with this global warming but believes there's something we should all do about it". [...] "These Four Walls" [...] is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative. [...] "Simple Song" [...] has [...] "bile" [...] sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person [...] "can't tell which way is up, which way is down" [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> the need to alienate themselves. In [...] "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more [...] "roosty" [...] with a more [...] "natural-sounding accompaniment" [...] while, in the lyrics, she finds her remembering the [...] "simple things ... until [...]" [...] "See You Again" [...] (Rock Mafia Remix) is dance-pop number, fusing sultry vocals with techno beats. The track has Cyrus detailing previous scenes and plans to redeem herself.|$|E

500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E
2500|$|Figgis had {{problems}} because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This {{caused him to}} film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and {{the authenticity of the}} acting, remarking [...] "I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout'.
