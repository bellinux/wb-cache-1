The presence of uterine milk proteins (UTM-proteins) in these samples was evaluated by Ouchterlony immuno-diffusion and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Eight often samples of allantoic fluid and three of ten samples of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> produced one or two immunoprecipitin bands against antiserum to UTiiA-pro-teins. Each band fused with immunoprecipitin bands from UTM-proteins purified from uterine fluid. Data from a semi-quantitative ELISA indicated that allantoic fluid from all ewes and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> from six of ten ewes contained immunoreactive UTIvI-proteins. Concentrations of (JTM-proteins in these fluids were not statistically affected by day of gestation (p> 0. I 0), but tended to decline as gestation advanced.

40|$|Placentitis is {{a common}} cause of {{pregnancy}} loss in the mare. Effective treatments for placentitis remain elusive. Ceftiofur sodium is effective against the most common pathogens causing placentitis, including Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. However, {{little is known about}} the pharmacokinetics of the drug in pregnant mares or whether or not the drug penetrates the fetal placental barrier. Eight pregnant pony mares were treated with ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel®) (4. 4 mg/kg, IM, q 24 h) for at least 4 days prior to induction of parturition. Mares were monitored daily for signs of onset of parturition and mammary secretions were tested daily for calcium concentrations using a commercial test. Parturition was induced using oxytocin (5 IU) administered at 25 minute intervals until the onset of parturition. <b>Allantoic</b> <b>fluid,</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and pre-suckle colostrum samples were collected. Plasma samples were collected at 2 hours post drug administration in the mare, and at birth (time point 0) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after delivery from mares and foals. Plasma samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography to detect concentrations of ceftiofur and its active metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA). Median plasma concentrations of DCA of 8. 61 (7. 38 - 8. 89) μg/ml were found at birth in the mare, while no detectable concentrations of the drug were found in foal plasma. Median DCA concentrations of 1. 70 (1. 30 - 1. 75) μg/ml were found in milk. No detectable amounts of the drug were found in either the <b>allantoic</b> or <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> Results from this study show that therapeutic concentrations of ceftiofur sodium seem not to attain the fetal compartment or foal plasma after drug administration to the mare prior to delivery.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with L-arginine during early pregnancy will ameliorate embryonic loss in pigs. Gilts were bred at the second estrus, and housed individually in pens and fed twice daily 1 kg of a corn- and soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0. 0 %, 0. 4 %, or 0. 8 % L-arginine (w/w) between d 0 and 25 of gestation (Experiment 1) or between d 14 and 25 of gestation (Experiments 2 and 3). At d 25 (Experiment 1 and 2) or d 60 (Experiment 3) of gestation, gilts were hysterectomized to obtain uteri and conceptuses. Total RNA and protein were extracted from the frozen tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and microarray analyses were performed to determine the changes of gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. Dietary supplementation with 0. 8 % L-arginine between d 0 and 25 of gestation decreased uterine weight, total number of fetuses, number of corpora lutea (CL), total fetal weight, total volume of <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> concentrations of progesterone in maternal plasma and allantoic fluid, compared to the control group. However, dietary supplementation with 0. 4 % or 0. 8 % L-arginine between d 14 and 25 of gestation increased total volume of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> total amounts of arginine in <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> total amounts of fructose and most amino acids in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> placental growth, and the number of viable fetuses per litter by 2. Dietary supplementation with 0. 4 % or 0. 8 % L-arginine between d 14 and 25 of gestation increased the total number of fetuses and number of live fetuses, rate of embryonic survival, and volumes of <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> in gilts with 15 to 18 CL on d 60 of gestation compared with the control group. The abundance of placental protein and expression of mRNA related to the genes for arginine transport and metabolism, including cationic amino acid transporter 1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS 3), phosphorylated-NOS 3, ornithine decarboxylase, and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-I was increased by dietary supplementation with 0. 8 % L-arginine between d 0 and 25 of gestation. The abundance of total and phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin was also enhanced by dietary 0. 8 % L-arginine supplementation between d 0 and 25 of gestation. Microarray analysis revealed that supplementation with 0. 8 % arginine between d 14 and 25 of gestation affected placental expression of 575 genes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine concentrations of amino acids and polyamines as well as nitric oxide (NO) and polyamine synthesis in the ovine conceptus (embryo/fetal and associated placental membrane). Ewes were hysterectomized on Days 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, or 140 of gestation to obtain <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> intercotyledonary placenta, placentomes and uterine endometrium for the analyses. Alanine, citrulline plus glutamine accounted for about 80 % of total &# 945;-amino acids in allantoic fluid during early gestation. Serine (16. 5 mM) contributed about 60 % of total &# 945;-amino acids in allantoic fluid on Day 140 of gestation. Maximal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and arginase activities and highest rates of polyamine and NO synthesis occured in all tissues on Day 40 of gestation. In ovine <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> polyamines were most abundant during early (Days 40 - 60) and late (Days 100 - 140) gestation, respectively. Activity of guanosine 5 ??-triphosphate-cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH), and concentrations of NOS cofactors, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), peaked on Day 40 of gestation in placental and endometrial tissues. In these tissues, NO synthesis was positively correlated with total NOS activity, GTP-CH activity, and concentrations of BH 4 and NADPH. The physiological significance of these changes was manifested by undernutrition-induced intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Maternal undernutrition (50 % of National Research Council nutrient requirements) reduced concentrations of total &# 945;-amino acids in fetal plasma and fluids, and retarded fetal growth at both mid (Day 78) and late (Day 135) gestation. Concentrations of polyamines in fetal fluids were lower in underfed ewes than in control-fed ewes. Realimentation of underfed ewes between Days 78 and 135 of gestation increased concentrations of total &# 945;-amino acids and polyamines in fetal plasma and fluids, when compared with non-realimented ewes. Results of these studies demonstrate metabolic coordination among the several integrated pathways to enable high rates of polyamine and NO synthesis in the placenta and endometrium during early pregnancy. Collectively, our findings may have important implications for both IUGR and fetal origins of adult disease...|$|R

The time course of secretion of MMP- 2 (72 kDa, gelatinase A) and MMP- 9 (92 kDa, gelatinase B) and TIMP into extra-embryonic coelomic, <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> in a rabbit model was examined. Furthermore, to evaluate their role in fetal membrane repair, the changes induced by fetoscopy at mid-gestation (23 days; gestation length is 32 days) were investigated. Zymography showed predominantly secretion of latent MMP- 2 at 18, 23 and 30 days of gestation in all gestational compartments. Reverse zymography detected a broad range of TIMP activity with molecular weights of 27 - 30 kDa (TIMP- 1, glycosylated TIMP- 3 and TIMP- 4), 24 kDa (unglycosylated TIMP- 3) and 21 kDa (TIMP- 2). Following fetoscopy, both MMP- 2 and TIMP increased significantly in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and extra-embryonic coelomic fluid, but not in allantoic fluid, as demonstrated by densitometric analyses.

Fetal:maternal plasma ratios for amino acids varied greatly, being less than 1 for glutamate dur-ing late gestation, 1. 5 – 3 for most amino acids throughout ges-tation, and greater than 10 for serine during late gestation. Marked changes were observed in amino acid concentrations in <b>amniotic</b> and <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> associated with conceptus devel-opment. Concentrations of alanine, citrulline, and glutamine in allantoic fluid increased by 20 -, 34 -, and 18 -fold, respectively, between Days 30 and 60 of gestation and were 24. 7, 9. 7, and 23. 5 mM, respectively, on Day 60 of gestation (compared with 0. 8 mM arginine). Remarkably, alanine, citrulline, plus gluta-mine accounted for approximately 80 % of total a-amino acids in allantoic fluid during early gestation. Serine (16. 5 mM) con-tributed approximately 60 % of total a-amino acids in allantoic fluid on Day 140 of gestation. These novel findings of the un-usual abundance of traditionally classified nonessential amino acids in allantoic fluid raise important questions regarding their roles in ovine conceptus development. amino acids, conceptus development, fetal fluids, shee...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ontogeny}} of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue {{concentrations were}} determined {{in the developing}} turkey embryo. At 2 -d intervals, starting on Day 6 of incubation, individual tissues (n = 8 for each stage of incubation) were removed, weighed, pulverized, and extracted in 1 M acetic acid for IGF-I determination. <b>Amniotic</b> and <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> were collected starting on Day 8, serum on Day 12, and analyzed for IGF-I levels. Serum IGF-I levels were the lowest on Days 12 and 28 of incubation (5. 9 and 9. 5 ng/mL), respectively, and the highest on Day 20 (16. 2 ng/mL). <b>Allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> IGF-I concentrations were essentially unchanged during incubation. Extra-embryonic tissue IGF-I levels increased in both the yolk sac and chorioallantoic membranes as incubation advanced with concentrations being 8 - to 10 -fold greater in the chorioallantois. Embryo tissue IGF-I concentrations varied greatly with regard to tissue and stage of development. Brain IGF-I levels were the highest on Day 8 and lowest on Day 26 (423 vs 35 pg/mg protein, respectively). Tissue IGF-I pattern in the heart mirrored that of brain. Liver IGF-I was low (< 40 pg/mg protein) from Day 10 to 20 and undetectable on Days 22 to 28. Muscle IGF-I levels were similar {{in the final days}} of development to those observed in early incubation. Bone IGF-I levels were highest in midincubation and lowest on Day 26. Peptide levels in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract and gizzard were dissimilar in that IGF-I was elevated in the GI tract in early incubation and declined with advancing incubation, whereas gizzard IGF-I levels peaked in late incubation. It is apparent that tissue synthesis of IGF-I is differentially regulated within a given tissue and stage of incubation during embryogenesis in the turkey embryo...|$|R
40|$|Enveloped animal viruses usually {{possess a}} surface {{glycoprotein}} which mediates fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane, hence enabling {{the initiation of}} infection, and its biosynthesis often involves post-translational endoproteolytic activation of the inactive precursor by a host cell protease(s). Therefore, the protease distribution in the host must be critical for determining the viral tropism. We previously isolated from chick embryo a cogent candidate endoprotease of this kind for paramyxovirus infection, and demonstrated its identity with factor X (FX), a vitamin K-dependent serine protease in the prothrombin family which, in general, is synthesized in the liver and circulates {{as one of the}} plasma proteases essential for blood clotting. Here, we examined FX expression with specific cDNA and antibody probes in a series of embryonic tissues. Many tissues other than the liver expressed the specific mRNA but, in most instances, the translation products remained inactive zymogen forms. The enzymatically active FXa was detectable only in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> and virus spreading was strictly confined to the tissues in direct contact with these FXa-containing fluids. Thus, the ectopically expressed FXa is probably the major host determinant of paramyxovirus tropism in ovo...|$|R
40|$|Cache Valley virus (CVV) induced malformations {{have been}} {{previously}} reproduced in ovine fetuses; however, no studies have established the CVV infection {{sequence of the}} cells targeted by the virus or {{the development of the}} antiviral response of the early, infected fetus that results in viral clearance before development of immunocompetency. To address these questions, ovine fetuses at 35 dg were inoculated in utero with CVV and euthanized at 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 dpi. On postmortem examination arthrogryposis and oligohydramnios were observed in some infected fetuses. Morphologic studies showed necrosis in the central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscle of earlier infected fetuses and hydrocephalus, micromyelia and muscular loss in later infected fetuses. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, intense CVV viral antigenic signal was detected in the brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscles and fetal membranes of infected fetuses. Viral signal decreased in targeted and infected tissues with the progression of the infection. To determine specific cell types targeted by CVV in the CNS, indirect immunofluorescence was applied to sections of the CNS using a double labeling technique with antibodies against CVV together with antibodies against neurons, astrocytes and microglia. CVV viral antigen was shown within the cytoplasm of neurons in the brain and spinal cord. No viral signal was observed in microglial cells; however, infected animals had marked microgliosis. The antiviral immune response in immature fetuses infected with CVV was evaluated. Gene expression associated with an innate, immune response was quantified by real-time, quantitative PCR. Upregulated genes in infected fetuses included ISG 15, Mx 1, Mx 2, IL- 1, IL- 6, TNF-?, TLR- 7 and TLR- 8. The amount of Mx protein, an interferon stimulated GTPase capable of restricting growth of bunyaviruses, was elevated in the <b>allantoic</b> and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> in infected fetuses. ISG 15 protein expression was significantly increased in target tissues of infected animals. B lymphocytes and immunoglobulin-positive cells were detected in lymphoid tissues and in the meninges of infected animals. This demonstrated that the infected ovine fetus is able to stimulate an innate and adaptive immune response before immunocompetency that presumably contributes to viral clearance in infected animals...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and serum {{samples that}} had been {{obtained}} from mothers at 10 to 33 wk of gestation were analyzed for retinol and retinol-binding protein. No difference was found in serum retinol with advancing gestation. The concentration of retinol in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> from 20 wk onward was significantly greater than at 16 to 18 wk. No esters of retinol and no carotenoids were detected in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> Serum and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> samples from the same mothers were significantly correlated for retinol (p < 0. 02). Retinol-binding protein, detected by radial immunodiffusion, was found in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> in molar excess of, and significantly (p < 0. 00 1) correlated with, retinol in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> Retinol in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> obtained at 16 to 18 wk from pregnancies that ended in anencephaly or other congenital defects ranged from 2. 3 to 18. 0 jg/dl.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} 33 -kDa serine protease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{is present in}} <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and, if so, whether its concentration changes with gestational age. Analyzing 115 <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> with a highly sensitive immunofluorometric procedure, we found PSA in all the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> examined and established that its concentration increases with increasing gestational age from 11 to 21 weeks, decreasing at delivery. PSA in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> is present predominantly in the free (33 kDa) form; a minor fraction (< 20 %) is present bound to a-antichymotrypsin. No significant correlation was seen between PSA and a-fetoprotein (AFP) in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> or maternal serum in samples with high AFP. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> PSA was also measurable by two different established methods for PSA.

40|$|The soluble {{form of the}} {{inhibitory}} {{immune receptor}} leukocyte-Associated Ig-like Receptor- 1 (sLAIR- 1) is present in plasma, urine and synovial fluid and correlates to inflammation. We and others previously showed inflammatory protein expression in normal <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> at term. We hypothesized that sLAIR- 1 is present in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> during term parturition and is related to fetal lung function development. sLAIR- 1 was detectable in all <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> samples (n= 355) collected during term spontaneous deliveries. First, potential intra-uterine origins of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> sLAIR- 1 were explored. Although LAIR- 1 was expressed {{on the surface of}} <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> neutrophils, LAIR- 1 was not secreted upon ex vivo neutrophil stimulation with LPS, or PMA/ionomycin. Cord blood concentrations of sLAIR- 1 were fourfold lower than and not related to <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> concentrations and placentas showed no or only sporadic LAIR- 1 positive cells. Similarly, in post-mortem lung tissue of term neonates that died of non-pulmonary disorders LAIR- 1 positive cells were absent or only sporadically present. In fetal urine samples, however, sLAIR- 1 levels were even higher than in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and correlated with <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> sLAIR- 1 concentrations. Second, the potential relevance of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> sLAIR- 1 was studied. sLAIR- 1 concentrations had low correlation to <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokines.
