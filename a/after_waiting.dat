The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years, but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serves two consecutive terms can run again <b>after</b> <b>waiting</b> out the next term.

Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. <b>After</b> <b>waiting</b> for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon.

Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, <b>after</b> <b>waiting</b> ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for extra pay had been denied. The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. <b>After</b> <b>waiting</b> for the group from Neuchâtel, which could not be found, Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack.

5|$|The French {{continued}} {{to press for}} the destruction of the Natchez who now lived among the Chickasaw, traditional allies of the British—this sparked the Chickasaw Wars. The Chickasaw at first agreed to drive out the Natchez from among them, but they did not keep good on the promise. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1736, the French, under Governor Bienville, attacked the Chickasaw villages of Apeony and Ackia, and then retreated, suffering significant casualties, but inflicting few. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1739, Bienville summoned more than 1,000 troops to be sent over from France. Bienville's army ascended the Mississippi River to the site of present-day Memphis, Tennessee, and attempted to build a military road westward toward Chickasaw villages. <b>After</b> <b>waiting</b> for months in the winter of 1739–40, the French never mounted an attack and retreated back to New Orleans. After having suffered the attacks against the Chickasaw, the remaining Natchez moved on to live among the Cherokee and Creek people. By that time the Natchez, reduced to scattered refugees, had ceased to exist as a political entity.|$|E

The brothers returned to see the priest the next day to demand an apology, and after receiving it, they began to return home. On the way there they were stopped by two gendarmes who arrested them for murder, informing them that the priest had been found dead ten minutes after they left his house. As the gendarmes prepared to take the Hastings to the police station, two more officers turned up with a villager in handcuffs. It transpired that the priest had been having an affair with the villager's sister, and <b>after</b> <b>waiting</b> for the Hastingses to leave he had entered the priest's house and killed him with a brick.

5|$|William {{may have}} hoped the English would {{surrender}} following his victory, {{but they did}} not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. <b>After</b> <b>waiting</b> a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was. These captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November. Next he led his forces around {{the south and west}} of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Archbishop Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Archbishop Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.|$|E
5|$|The Aghlabids {{replaced}} Abu Fihr with al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, who displayed great energy: {{immediately after}} his arrival he led a raid against the environs of Syracuse, and then another into central Sicily, around Enna. The Byzantine strategos marched out to meet them, but the Muslims withdrew to a mountainous and thickly forested area where the Byzantines could not pursue. <b>After</b> <b>waiting</b> in vain for the Muslims to accept battle, the strategos turned his army back, but was ambushed by the Muslims who put his men to flight. The Muslims seized most of the Byzantines' arms, equipment and animals, and almost managed to capture the severely wounded strategos himself. Despite his success, Ibn Yaqub was replaced in September by a new governor, the Aghlabid prince Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim ibn Abdallah ibn al-Aghlab, a first cousin of the emir Ziyadat Allah. At the same time, the long-awaited Byzantine reinforcements arrived. The Byzantine fleet contested the passage of Abu'l-Aghlab's small fleet, which lost ships both to the Byzantine attack and to storms; the Byzantines however could not prevent it from reaching Palermo, and were driven off by a squadron from the city under Muhammad ibn al-Sindi. Abu'l-Aghlab avenged himself by launching naval raids against Pantelleria and other localities, beheading the Christians taken prisoner. At the same time, a Muslim cavalry raid reached the eastern parts of the island around Mount Etna, burning the villages and crops and taking captives.|$|E
