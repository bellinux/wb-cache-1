25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened,</b> still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Prior to his audition, Rockwell [...] "immersed" [...] {{himself in}} the role by {{watching}} episodes of The Gong Show {{in an attempt to}} impress the filmmakers. [...] "I went to LA [...] did an old-fashioned screen test, like a real Scarlett O'Hara-type screen test, which you know they don't really do anymore," [...] the actor remembered. For research, Rockwell spent {{two and a half months}} with Barris. [...] "We went to coffee shops and dinner and movies, took walks, went to the zoo; I even filmed him," [...] Rockwell explained. [...] "I had him tape my lines in a tape recorder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to that to get his voice down." ...|$|E

So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film." [...] An instrumental of the song [...] "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)" [...] by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.|$|E

2500|$|Kember was a keen record {{collector}} {{from the}} age of 11 or 12; some of the first records he purchased included albums by The Velvet Underground. Pierce: [...] "When I was 14, I bought The Stooges' Raw Power <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to nothing but that for a year". Spacemen 3's early gig posters would often make explicit references to their sound being inspired by The Stooges, The Velvet Underground and The Rolling Stones. In 1988, Kember said, [...] "Groups like Suicide or the MC5 are like my favorite stuff in the world". Pierce said, [...] "Early on, we were listening to The Stooges, then came Suicide, then we'd start listening to Sun Ra, and pick up on all these lateral threads that ran between them".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKee {{continued}} {{working on}} the song the following days. She explained, [...] "I thought about my own adolescent years, my own first love. I thought about watching Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' and putting on a little mini disco ball light and just dreaming of Leo. I thought about me and my friends sitting around at slumber parties in the 90's, giddy even just THINKING about boys..... I thought about what Benny said <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to the song again, and I was like The Teenagers..... that's such a great word, Teenager. It is a very descriptive word; it packs a lot of emotion and imagery into three syllables..... I couldn't believe after all of our agonizing over 'youth' themes, that we had overlooked such an obvious one – the teenage condition." [...] The following week, Perry invited McKee, Luke, and Martin to write at her hometown of Santa Barbara, California. McKee tried to approach Luke about her idea, but he was upset {{about the amount of}} time he had spent working in the chorus, so he banned them from changing it. They started {{working on the}} verses, where Perry had already prepared most of the imagery.|$|E

2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. She {{turned on the radio}} and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, 2013, Nipsey Hussle {{announced}} he would release a new mixtape titled, Crenshaw hosted by DJ Drama, on October 8, 2013. He explained the title saying, [...] "This is my area. This is my home town. This is really like where I {{spent a lot of}} my time as a youth. Crenshaw is a foundation to my personality and my story. It’s where it took place at." [...] He explained the mixtape consists of mostly leftover tracks, [...] "I recorded a lot of songs for the Victory Lap project, and I got a certain vision I'm going for with the project, and I just did a lot of work and I think I got what I was looking for with the Victory Lap album, and I still got a lot of great records. So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to the playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like. And really kinda like, create the question in their mind, 'if this is the mixtape, what is gunna be on the album?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] has {{influenced}} {{the production of}} numerous songs and inspired various artists to foray into the rock genre. Record producer RedOne was inspired by [...] "Black Cat" [...] for several songs on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love. Jessica Simpson considers the song an influence, saying [...] "Janet's music rocks," [...] citing [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] specifically, adding [...] "Janet affects my music." [...] Fefe Dobson said the song was a primary influence for her third album Joy, saying [...] "I heard Janet’s ‘Black Cat,’ with its rock guitar riff. That’s what this album reflects." [...] Dobson explained, “Black Cat” incorporated a bunch {{of different types of}} music into one song. It was pop. It was punk. It was rock and roll. And I am all of those things. I think it hit me as a kid really hard, because I love to experience a fusion of musical genres." [...] Mexican singer Selena cited Jackson among her main influences; with Chris Pérez stating, [...] "Selena especially loved Jackson's song [...] "Black Cat" ... I can't even count how many times Selena <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to that single." [...] Solange Knowles also called the song an influence, saying, [...] "I remember I had a solo dance for a song of hers called 'Black Cat', and that was the start of my Janet love affair," [...] wearing a black unitard and cat ears. [...] Rihanna's single [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] was considered reminiscent of Jackson's pursuit, and she also worked with Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist on the single edit of [...] "Black Cat," [...] during the song's live performances. Alanis Morissette's transition from dance-pop into alternative rock with Jagged Little Pill was partially inspired by the song, with author Paul Cantin writing, [...] "She may have been a fan of dance music, but when the band covered Janet Jackson's rock-flavoured song [...] "Black Cat," [...] her bandmates could see how eager she was to let go." [...] Singer-songwriter BJ the Chicago Kid cited Jackson's performance on the Rhythm Nation World Tour as an inspiration to enter the music industry, saying [...] "I remember seeing the Black Cat tour with Janet Jackson as a kid. They were wheeling a cage out on stage and there’s a black panther in there! I’m like a kid in the photographers pit like, ‘Woah.' She’s beautiful and I’m seeing a real live fucking cat.. [...] would later be signed to Motown Records and do the same thing. So they were instilling and pouring into my soul the whole time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E

5000|$|Moss {{was one of}} 12 {{children}} born to a sharecropper in Jewell, Georgia, in Warren County, midway between Atlanta and Augusta. There is some disagreement about the year of his birth, some sources indicating 1906 and many others of more recent vintage claiming 1914. He began teaching himself the harmonica {{at a very early}} age, and he played at local parties around Augusta, where the family moved when he was four and remained for the next 10 years. By 1928, he was busking around the streets of Atlanta. [...] "Nobody was my influence," [...] he told Robert Springer of his harmonica playing, in a 1975 interview. [...] "I just kept hearing people, so <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen,</b> <b>and</b> listen, and it finally come to me." ...|$|R
