5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringingâ€”this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters.</b> The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps {{it is not possible}} for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is whether they can suffer.|$|E

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters.</b> There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of Fanaa, Kajol worked {{intermittently}} {{through the rest of}} the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, [...] "She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs." [...] Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, [...] "Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb." [...] Raja Sen added, [...] " [...] can span through happy-breezy with her eyes closed, and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high." [...] The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E

500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|AVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's {{financial}} backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to {{play the}} role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the [...] "lightweight" [...] screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as [...] "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness." [...] <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to Snake, according to the actor, is [...] "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." [...] Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Eddie Guerrero and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL). One preplanned move in the match saw Guerrero hit JBL with a steel chair, which caused JBL to bleed. Guerrero went on to touch three {{turnbuckles}} {{but was unable to}} touch the fourth as JBL held him back. Guerrero executed a dropkick on JBL and attempted to touch the fourth again but JBL held him back and took the advantage. JBL threw Guerrero into a broadcast table and executed a powerbomb through the broadcast table. In the end, each man had touched three turnbuckles and were vying for the fourth. Guerrero attempted to jump over JBL and touch the remaining turnbuckle, but was unsuccessful; he splashed himself and JBL into the turnbuckle. Guerrero was declared the winner, as it appeared he had touched all four turnbuckles first, but General Manager Kurt Angle came out and reversed the decision. He showed on the TitanTron that JBL's shoulder touched the final turnbuckle before Guerrero's hand, also, Angle stated that it doesn't matter which part of the body touch, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is who touch first; as a result, JBL won the title.|$|E

[...] In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics.
