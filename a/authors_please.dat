We investigate a model where dark energy {{is caused by}} the photon field coupling to gravitation. The cosmological background expectation value of the electromagnetic scalar potential generates the Planck mass as well as causing an exponential expansion which is identified with dark energy. The Higgs-like mechanism for the vector potential predicts the photon mass to be exactly zero.

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{withdrawn}} by the <b>authors.</b> <b>Please</b> see arXiv: 1302. 6058. We consider the sequential joint detection and estimation problem. Minimizing the average stopping time {{subject to a}} combination of detection and estimation constraints we obtain the optimal triplet of stopping time, detector and estimator. In the joint detection and estimation problem the primary goal is to detect and estimate together, as opposed to the conventional testing of composite hypotheses where the primary goal is to detect only. For {{the first time in the}} literature we develop optimal solution to the sequential joint detection and estimation problem. In the sequential version of the problem, different from the fixed sample size version, optimal stopping time is also sought, complicating the solution considerably.

Under certain assumptions {{we present a}} performance evaluation algorithm {{which is based on}} physical decomposition of the network and use of an aggregation/disaggregation algorithm. We consider two important performance measures: system throughput and work-in-process inventory. Performance evaluation of these systems is difficult because of the mating of parts and a kanban-like operating mechanism. Our algorithm was tested using simulation and found to be accurate...|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} {{presented in}} "Rotation Velocities and Radial Electric Field in the Plasma Edge" by W. M. Stacey [Contrib. Plasma Phys. 46, (2006) ] contains an inconsistent {{treatment of the}} electrostatic potential. Comparing the expressions for the potential associated with the radial electrostatic field with that associated with the poloidal electrostatic field reveals the inconsistency. A field-theoretic perspective implies that the electrostatic field must vanish in a model based upon the physics of a neutral, conducting fluid.
