50|$|Some 2,000 migratory <b>open-bill</b> <b>storks,</b> locally {{known as}} shamukkhol (oyster shell), are found {{settling}} every year near the marshy {{lands in the}} Milki area of Sagardighi.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the town}} is the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, which is the {{breeding}} site for several bird species, including the painted <b>stork,</b> <b>open-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> black-headed ibis, river tern, great stone plover and Indian shag.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} migratory birds arrive here {{each year from}} South Asian {{countries}} and coastal regions. They start arriving from June. The migratory species includes <b>open-bill</b> <b>storks,</b> egrets, night herons and cormorants. The resident birds are kites, flycatchers, owls, kingfishers, woodpeckers, drongoes, etc.|$|R
50|$|Birds: {{garganey}} teals, glossy ibis, grey heron, grey pelican, <b>open-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> painted stork,snake bird, spoonbill, spot bill duck, cormorants, darter, grebes, large egret, little egrets, moorhen, night herons, paddy bird, painted stork, pintails, pond heron, sandpiper, shovellers, terns, white ibis. They {{migrate from}} Europe during November and December {{to escape the}} frost that sets in.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Open-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> Anastomus oscitans in the Raiganj {{wildlife}} sanctuary, {{preferred the}} core region than buffer {{region of the}} sanctuary for nesting as though core region was relatively undisturbed and rich in food for stork. In two breeding seasons, the fledgling success was greater at the nests that were located in the core region than in the buffer region of the sanctuary. The availability of food in the nearby areas and protection from the predators were the main factors for rising storks’ population. The <b>Open-billed</b> <b>stork</b> built more nest in the year 2008 than in the year 2007. They selected 599 trees for nesting of which 249 trees were Lagerstroemia spaciosa in the year 2007 which increased to 615 trees for nesting of which 280 trees were Lagerstroemia speciosa in the year 2008. The percentage of unhatched eggs, damaged eggs by predation, storm and heavy rain was higher in the year 2007 than in the year 2008. The nestlings death mainly caused by storm and heavy rain, by dropping dur-ing first flight and by predation. The main natural predators of the species in the sanctuary were House crow (Corvus splendens) and Bengal monitor (Varanus bengalensis). The overall hatching success and fledging suc-cess were 91. 71 % and 83. 96 % in the year 2007 which increased to 94. 86 % and 87. 95 % in the year 2008 respec-tively. The breeding behavior of <b>Open-billed</b> <b>stork</b> was disturbed by visitors and villagers activities and by vehi-cles during breeding season in the sanctuary. The villagers also invaded to collect fire wood into the buffer region as well as core region of the sanctuary during breeding season. As though the <b>Open-billed</b> <b>stork</b> can tolerate this type of disturbances, so they can breed in the sanctuary. But disturbed birds may show increased failure rates despite their lack of immediate behavioural responses to human pressure. The number of stork population was increased from 44816 to 58920 in the year 2007 and 2008 in the Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary. It {{may be due to}} the availability of nesting trees, nesting materials, availability of safe nesting zone and availability of food of this particular bird species. But proper management should be taken to increase their successful breeding...|$|R

50|$|Situated {{along the}} National Highway {{and by the}} side of the Kulik river is the Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary with an area of 35 acre and buffer area of 286.23 acre. The forest, water bodies and the river attract the migratory birds like Open Bill Strok, Night heron, {{cormorant}}, little cormorant & Egrets from South Asian countries and coastal regions. Local birds like dove, bulbul, sparrow, king fisher, woodpeckers, owl, duck & cuckoo, can also be seen in large numbers. The migratory birds arrive from end of May to Ist week of July and depart from mid December to end of January. The nesting time is from July to August & egg laying from August to September. The flying training to the young ones is the best time to observe the birds, around October to November. Every winter nearly 150 different bird species arrive here from the north in numbers ranging from 65,000 to 75,000. Some of the common migratory birds seen here are <b>Open-Billed</b> <b>Storks,</b> Asian <b>Open-billed</b> <b>storks,</b> Egrets, Knight Herons, and Cormorants. Indian birds like kites, flycatchers, kingfishers, owls, woodpeckers, drongos, and bee eaters. The sanctuary has artificial network of man made canals which is connected to the River Kulik. During the months of monsoon the flood water from the river enters the plains of the sanctuary. This acts as the important source of food for most of the bird species.|$|R

5000|$|Here is a {{description}} from a visitor: “On {{our way out}} from Kolkata to Raiganj, {{we were about to}} cross the bridge over the Kulik river on National Highway 34 when we saw hundreds of storks circling a patch of forest across the river. Intuitively, I knew we had arrived... Once up there (tourist lodge observatory)... we saw that all the 30-odd trees in the lodge compound were occupied by hundreds of <b>open-billed</b> <b>storks...</b> During our half-hour in the observatory, we saw flocks flying overhead carrying twigs to build their nests. Those that already had nests were busy sitting on eggs or tending to hatchlings. It was equally fascinating watching some taking time off from family chores to preen themselves and smooth ruffled feathers.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Otteri lake {{situated}} on the north-western side within the park premises acts as a roosting ground for {{a wide array of}} aquatic migratory birds such as the <b>open-bill</b> <b>stork,</b> painted stork, white ibis, grey heron, night heron, cormorants, darters, egrets, dabchicks, pelicans, great pelicans, glossy ibis and moorhen, making it a bird watchers' paradise.

50|$|Excess {{rainwater}} is drained {{into the}} sea through a channel called the Oggiyam Madavu, a contiguous portion of the marsh at Oggiyam Thorapakkam draining into the Buckingham Canal, which in turn discharges into the Kovalam estuary. Locally known as Kazhiveli (a generic Tamil name for marshes and swamps), the marsh drained about 250 km2, through two outlets, namely, the Okkiyam Madavu and the Kovalam creek. Remnant forests can be observed within the Theosophical Society campus, Guindy National Park-IIT complex and the Nanmangalam Reserve Forest.The heterogeneous ecosystem of the marshland supports about 337 species of floras and faunas.

50|$|Thousands of fish {{tanks were}} dug up {{effectively}} converting the lake into a mere drain. This had great impact {{in terms of}} pollution, leading to difficulty in getting drinking water for the local people. This is {{in addition to the}} loss of ecological diversity and intrusion of sea water into the land masses and its fallout in terms of adverse influence on the rainfall pattern in this region. This imbalance has an adverse effect on the thousands of acres of crop in the upper reaches of sanctuary in view of stoppages water flow into the sea because of obstruction by bunds of the fish tanks that appeared illegally.Satellite images taken on February 9, 2001 by the Indian remote sensing satellite found that approximately 42% of the 245 km2 lake was occupied by aquaculture, while agriculture had encroached another 8.5%. The area under aquaculture consisted of 1050 fish ponds within the lake and 38 dried-up fish ponds, which together covered an area of 103 km2. The agricultural encroachments were mostly rice paddies. Surprisingly no clear water could be found in the satellite image. The rest of the lake is being diminished by water diversions or was infested with weeds like elephant grass and water hyacinth.Rich in flora and fauna, it attracts migratory birds from northern Asia and Eastern Europe between the months of October and March. During this season, the lake is visited by an estimated two million birds. The resident birds include grey pelicans, Asian <b>open-billed</b> <b>storks</b> (Anastomus oscitans), painted storks (Mycteria leucocephala), glossy ibises, white ibises, teals, pintails and shovellers. The migratory birds include red-crested pochards, blackwinged stilts, avocets, common red shanks, wigeons, gadwalls and cormorants, garganeys, herons and flamingos.|$|R
5000|$|The stork family {{contains}} six genera {{in three}} broad groups: the <b>open-billed</b> and wood <b>storks</b> (Mycteria and Anastomus), the giant storks (Ephippiorhynchus, Jabiru and Leptoptilos), and the [...] "typical" [...] storks, Ciconia. The typical storks include the white stork {{and six other}} extant species, which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage. Its closest relatives are the larger, black-billed Oriental white stork (Ciconia boyciana) of East Asia, which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the white stork, and the maguari stork (C. maguari) of South America. Close evolutionary relationships within Ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and, biochemically, through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridization.|$|R
