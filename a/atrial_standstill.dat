40|$|AbstractPersistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> is a {{very rare}} pathophysiologic {{condition}} whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill,</b> the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill.</b> The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122. 5 ± 14. 8 and 207. 5 ± 8. 3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 ± 14. 1 and 116. 4 ± 51. 5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18. 9 ± 9. 8 and 30. 8 ± 19. 2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing {{because of lack of}} atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> had undetectable (< 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> compared with the other groups. This study indicates that “endocrinologic silence” accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill...</b>|$|E

40|$|Emery-Dreifuss muscular {{dystrophy}} (EDMD) {{is a rare}} X-linked muscular disease with a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if electrocardiogram (ECG) was useful to differentiate EDMD from other muscular dystrophies, mainly facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and limb-girdle {{muscular dystrophy}} that usually have a benign course and a good prognosis. Our own experience consists of 3 patients of the same family with EDMD, 2 of them having a persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> during 22 years follow-up. Therefore we have reviewed the ECG patterns of 125 cases of EDMD reported in the literature and found persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> (PAS) in 37 patients (30 %) and complete (31 patients, 25 %) or incomplete (22 patients, 18 %) A-V block. On the contrary no case of <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> was recorded in the patients with the diagnoses of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy or other types of muscular dystrophies based on rigorous clinical criteria. On an other hand, in a survey of the etiologies of 109 cases of PAS, we have found 36 patients with EDMD (33 %). Moreover in 27 patients with EDMD who had a 12 lead surface ECG, PAS was associated with a left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) in 14 cases (52 %). Conversely in 51 patients without EDMD, PAS was associated with a LAFB in 5 cases only (10 %, P< 0. 01). Conclusion 1 The presence of persistent <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> can probably help to differentiate Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy from other muscular dystrophies more especially as a left anterior fascicular block is associated. 2 Pacemaker insertion is recommended in that case to avoid the risk of sudden death...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose-Emery-Dreifuss muscular {{dystrophy}} (EDMD) {{is a rare}} inherited disorder associated with cardiac involvement. We investigated the spectrum and relevance of the cardiac manifestations of EDMD, focusing on bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation/flutter), embolic stroke, and heart failure. Methods and Results-Eighteen patients (age 42. 8 +/- 19. 6 years) with genetically confirmed X-linked (n= 10, including 3 carriers) or autosomal dominant (n= 8) EDMD were followed for a period ranging from 1 to 30 years in a research center for neuromuscular diseases and in a university cardiological department. Pacemakers were required by 10 of 18 (56 %) patients for bradyarrhythmia, and related complications occurred in 3 of 10 (30 %) cases. Atrial fibrillation/flutter developed in 11 of 18 (61 %) patients, with <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> subsequently occurring in 5 of 11 (45 %) cases and embolic stroke (most often disabling) in 4 of 11 (36 %). Heart failure requiring transplantation occurred in 1 of 18 (6 %) patients, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in a further 3 (17 %). No relationship was evident between neuromuscular impairment and cardiac involvement. Conclusions-Both X-linked and autosomal dominant EDMD patients risk not only bradyarrhythmia (requiring pacemaker implant) but also atrial fibrillation/flutter, which often anticipates <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> and can cause disabling embolic stroke at a relatively young age. Antithromboembolic prophylaxis has to be recommended in EDMD patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter or <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill.</b> With careful monitoring, survival after pacemaker implant may be long.

40|$|Inherited {{arrhythmia}} syndromes {{have advanced}} {{our understanding of}} cardiac sodium (Na) channel function in health and disease.

Combined genetic, electrophysiological and molecular studies have provided insight into the dysfunction and dysregulation of the cardiac sodium channel in the setting of SCN 5 A mutations identified in patients with these inherited arrhythmia syndromes. However, risk stratification and patient management is hindered by the reduced penetrance and variable disease expressivity in sodium channelopathies. Furthermore, various SCN 5 A-related arrhythmia syndromes are known to display mixed phenotypes known as cardiac sodium channel overlap syndromes. Determinants of variable disease expressivity, including genetic background and environmental factors, are suspected but still largely unknown. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that sodium channel function and regulation is more complicated than previously assumed, and the sodium channel may play additional, as of yet unrecognized, roles in cardiac structure and function.

30|$|Nav 1.5 is {{the primary}} sodium channel in the heart and is {{essential}} for the cardiac action potential initiation. More than 400 Nav 1.5 mutations have been discovered and they are implicated {{in a wide variety of}} cardiac diseases—including PFHB 1 A (progressive familial heart block 1 A), LQT 3, BRGDA 1, SSS 1, VF 1 (familial paroxysmal ventricular fibrillation 1), SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), ATRST 1 (<b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> 1), CMD 1 E (cardiomyopathy, dilated 1 E), ATFB 10 (atrial fibrillation, familial, 10), and MEPPC (multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions) (Fig.  5 B and Table  6). By mapping all the Nav 1.5 mutations onto the Nav 1.7 structure model, it shows that most mutations are located in the transmembrane regions of the channel, suggesting that these mutations might disturb voltage sensing or sodium conduction (Fig.  5 B). Furthermore, about 50 % of the Nav 1.5 mutations account for BRGDA 1, while 30 % for LQT 3. Similar to the case of Nav 1.1, mutations in Nav 1.5 can be either loss-of-function or gain-of-function. For example, loss-of-function mutations are associated with BRGDA 1, CMD 1 E, SSS 1, and ATFB 10 (Tan et al., 2001; Smits et al., 2005; Makiyama et al., 2008; Laurent et al., 2012), while gain-of-function mutations of Nav 1.5 are responsible for LQT 3 (Remme et al., 2006), CMD 1 E, and ATFB 10 (Olson et al., 2005), and most recently MEPPC (Swan et al., 2014).|$|E

Although patch-clamp studies in heterologous expression systems have provided important information to understand the genotype-phenotype relationships of these diseases, they could not clarify how mutations can be responsible for such a large spectrum of diseases, the late age of onset or the progressiveness of some of them, and for the overlapping syndromes.

This study investigates the genetic background of this arrhythmogenic disorder in a large family. Forty-four family members were clinically evaluated. One deceased and three living relatives were unambiguously affected by AS. All other relatives appeared unaffected. Candidate gene screening revealed a novel mutation in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN 5 A (D 1275 N) in all three affected living relatives and in five unaffected relatives, and the deceased relative was an obligate carrier. In addition, two closely linked polymorphisms were detected within regulatory regions of the gene for the atrial-specific gap junction protein connexin 40 (C× 40) at nucleotides - 44 (G→A) and + 71 (A→G). Eight relatives were homozygous for both polymorphisms, which occurred in only ≈ 7 % of control subjects, and three of these relatives were affected by AS. The three living AS patients exclusively coinherited both the rare Cx 40 genotype and the SCN 5 A-D 1275 N mutation. SCN 5 A-D 1275 N channels showed a small depolarizing shift in activation compared with wild-type channels.

40|$|Slowed {{myocardial}} {{conduction velocity}} (θ) {{is associated with}} an increased risk of re-entrant excitation, predisposing to cardiac arrhythmia. θ is determined by the ion channel and physical properties of cardiac myocytes and by their interconnections. Thus, θ is closely related to the maximum rate of action potential (AP) depolarisation ((dV/dt) max), as determined by the fast Na+ current (INa); the axial resistance (ra) to local circuit current flow between cells; their membrane capacitances (cm); and to the geometrical relationship between successive myocytes within cardiac tissue. These determinants are altered by a wide range of pathophysiological conditions. Firstly, INa is reduced by the impaired Na+ channel function that arises clinically during heart failure, ischaemia, tachycardia, and following treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Such reductions also arise as a consequence of mutations in SCN 5 A such as those occurring in Len&# 232;gre disease, Brugada syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Secondly, ra, may be increased due to gap junction decoupling following ischaemia, ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, or as a result of mutations in CJA 5 found in idiopathic AF and <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill.</b> Finally, either ra or cm could potentially be altered by fibrotic change through the resultant decoupling of myocyte-myocyte connections and coupling of myocytes with fibroblasts. Such changes are observed in myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy or following mutations in MHC 403 and SCN 5 A resulting in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or Len&# 232;gre disease respectively. This review defines and quantifies the determinants of θ and summarises experimental evidence that links changes in these determinants with reduced myocardial θ and arrhythmogenesis. It thereby identifies the diverse pathophysiological conditions in which abnormal θ may contribute to arrhythmia...|$|E
40|$|Background- Atrial {{dilatation}} and <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> are etiologically heterogeneous phenotypes with poorly defined nosology. In 1983, we described 8 -years {{follow-up of}} atrial dilatation with standstill evolution in 8 patients from 3 families. We later identified 5 additional patients with identical phenotypes: 1 {{member of the}} largest original family and 4 unrelated to the 3 original families. All families are from the same geographic area in Northeast Italy. Methods and Results- We followed up the 13 patients for up to 37 years, extended the clinical investigation and monitoring to living relatives, and investigated the genetic basis of the disease. The disease was characterized by: (1) clinical onset in adulthood; (2) biatrial dilatation up to giant size; (3) early supraventricular arrhythmias with progressive loss of atrial electric activity to atrial standstill; (4) thromboembolic complications; and (5) stable, normal left ventricular function and New York Heart Association functional class during the long-term course of the disease. By linkage analysis, we mapped a locus at 1 p 36. 22 containing the Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A gene. By sequencing Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (p. Arg 150 Gln) in all living affected individuals of the 6 families. All patients showed low serum levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. Heterozygous mutation carriers were healthy and demonstrated normal levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. Conclusions- Autosomal recessive atrial dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare disease associated with homozygous mutation of the Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A gene and characterized by extreme atrial dilatation with standstill evolution, thromboembolic risk, preserved left ventricular function, and severely decreased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{records of}} six dogs {{admitted}} with acute hypoadrenocorticism were reviewed. All 6 animals were bradycardic and had prolonged capillary refilling time. Hypothermia was detected in 5 / 6 animals. Clinicopathological evaluation on admission revealed anemia (3 / 6 dogs), increased (2 / 6) and normal (2 / 6) lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, azotemia and hyperkalemia (6 / 6), hyponatremia, in 5 / 6 dogs in which sodium {{was measured with}} a sodium (Na) : potassium (K) ratio lower than 24, hypoglycemia (2 / 6) and hypercalcemia, hypocholosterolemia, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and alaninoaminotransferase activities, one dog each. Urine specific gravity was lower than 1025 in 4 dogs. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasonography disclosed microcardia (2 / 6), pleural effusion (2 / 6) and ascites (1 / 6). Two dogs (2 / 6), also, presented <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> or atrioventricular block, detected on electrocardiograms. In all 6 animals emergency treatment included the use of intravenous normal saline and glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) immediately {{after the completion of}} an ACTH stimulation test with tetracosactide. Two dogs died, one during the PI day and the other on the 4 (th) day of hospitalization, the latter after the sudden appearance of severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Hospitalization time in the remaining 4 dogs ranged from 3 to 10 days. Prolongation of hospitalization was associated with worsening of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, neurologic complications and non-responsive azotemia. Four dogs (4 / 6) were discharged on oral prednisolone and fluodrocortisone, but one died after a week for unknown reasons. Acute hypoadrenocorticism is a life-threatening condition requiring emergency treatment for a successful outcome. Its inclusion in the differential diagnosis of canine emergencies, presented with acute weakness and gastrointestinal signs, is mandatory, but for its confirmation a complete laboratory and, most importantly, an ACTH stimulation test are always required...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} species of the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium have been implicated in the {{production}} of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins but occasionally have also been associated with the mortality of both cage-reared and wild raffish in such places as the Faroe Islands (A. tamarense) (Mortensen 1985), Taiwan (A. minutum) (Su et al. 1993) and Egypt (A. minutum) (Halim 1996). In the present work exocellular toxicity was investigated in two species of Australian dinoflagellates, A. minutum and Gymnodinium catenation. Both are known producers of neurotoxic PSP toxins, but these toxins are only known to exist endocellularly. Investigations took the form of animal based biological assays using the brine shrimp, Artemia sauna, and juvenile greenback flounder, Rhombosolea taparina, which were exposed to whole cell and cell-free cultures of the algae. Bioassays determined the time to mortality for both species, while pathological changes in major tissues and changes in physiochemical characteristics of the blood were characterised only in the flounder. Even though Artemia did not feed on toxic dinoflagellate cells of G. catenatum and A. minutum, cultures of these two species were found to kill Artemia within 24 hours. However, only A. minutum culture-filtrate was toxic to Artemia whereas G. catenatum culture-filtrate was not. Likewise, culture-filtrate of unialgal G. catenation cultures was found to be non-toxic to flounder with no pathological changes in gills or other tissues observed. This disproves the suspected involvement of G. catenation as the cause of clubbing necrosis gill syndrome (Clark et al. 1997) documented in farmed Atlantic salmon in Tasmania. In contrast, the culture-filtrate of unialgal A. minutum cultures was found to be highly toxic to flounder. Artemia and flounder mortality occurred within 24 h of exposure to full strength A. minutum culture-filtrate. Flounder exhibited mild to severe histopathological gill changes including: swelling, degeneration and sloughing of the respiratory epithelium. The primary lamellar epithelial cells were so swollen in some areas that they displaced the respiratory epithelial cells into the interlaminar region. Also apparent were varying degrees of swelling, vacuolation, degeneration and cytoplasmic shrinkage of the gill chloride cells and hypertrophic or discharged mucocytes. Also common were antemortem blood clots in the heart ventricular tissue. Changes in blood physiochemical characteristics of flounder were also found with increases in blood potassium inducing a state of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia affects the contractile functioning of the heart, causing bradycardia and <b>atrial</b> <b>standstill</b> and can lead to cardiac arrest. Increases in gill-associated succinic dehydrogenase activity were observed but only when flounder were exposed to 60...|$|E
