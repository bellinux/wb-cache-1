FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands {{the task force}} searching for Doggett, believing the video is proof that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted. Meanwhile, Doggett phones a U.S. Marine Corps public affairs office, hoping his Marine tattoo will {{shed some light on}} his true identity. Before he is able to <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions,</b> he notices policemen nearby and flees.|$|E
25|$|Winfrey claims her worst {{interviewing}} {{experience was}} with Elizabeth Taylor in the show's second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey not to <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> about her relationships. Winfrey found {{this to be}} a challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times. Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey and told her that she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.|$|E
25|$|The debates {{lasted about}} 90 minutes each, {{did not include}} commercials, and had a preset time for each answer and each reply, and the {{obligation}} to film only the speaking person at any given time. The candidates were also forbidden to bring any kind of notes with them, even though they could write some down during the debate, and no audience was allowed to participate. This set of rules was very unusual in Italian political talk shows, where politicians usually interrupt each other, talk simultaneously and {{for as long as}} they can hold the word. Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself was not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions,</b> but only to present the debate and guarantee respect of the rules. At the end of the debates, the candidates are allowed to make a final statement of 3 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E

When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, he gave his longest answer, but it was about his favorite magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland. He also stated that he had [...] "instructed" [...] the show's producers to not <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> about his career as a screenwriter and actor.|$|E

2500|$|To {{become a}} full member, the {{prospect}} must {{be voted on}} unanimously {{by the rest of}} the full club members. Prior to votes being cast, a prospect usually travels to every chapter in the sponsoring chapter's geographic jurisdiction (state/province/territory) and introduces himself to every Full-Patch member. This process allows each voting member to become familiar with the subject and to <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> of concern prior to the vote. Some form of formal induction follows, wherein the prospect affirms his loyalty to the club and its members. The final logo patch (top [...] "Hells Angels" [...] rocker) is then awarded at this initiation ceremony. The step of attaining full membership can be referred to as [...] "being patched".|$|E
2500|$|Khidr or al-Khidr or Abul Abbas Ahmad al Khidr (Arabic: الخضر al-Khiḍr [...] "the Green One", also {{transcribed}} as Khidar, Khizr, Khyzer, Khizar) is a revered {{figure in}} Islam, whom the Qur'an {{describes as a}} righteous servant of God, who possessed great wisdom or mystic knowledge. He is most often {{said to be a}} contemporary of [...] Moses, but in other variations of his story, he lived {{at the same time as}} Abraham, the mythological Persian king Afridun and Nashiya bin Amus. The 18th sura ("The Cave") presents a narrative where Khidr accompanies Moses and tests him about his oath to not <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions.</b> Tom Cheetham, an authority on Islamic mysticism, identifies Khidr of esoteric Sufism with the Green Man. In his book about the work of Henry Corbin and others concerning the 12th-century Muslim saint Ibn Arabi, he develops the idea of the Green Man/Khidr as the principle mediating between the imaginary realm and the physical world.|$|E
2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates {{walk through}} a stream and find {{a seat in the}} shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with [...] "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out", the speech {{proceeds}} to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> if something has been left out.|$|E

2500|$|NYGASP has an {{arrangement}} with the school district in Syosset, New York, in which, each spring, a shortened version of one of a G opera is presented at a school, with piano accompaniment, using NYGASP principals, and giving an opportunity to 40-60 6th grade students to act as the chorus. [...] The music teachers teach the students their vocal parts, and then Bergeret and a NYGASP accompanist teach the students the staging and choreography of the show and refine the choral music. [...] The children rehearse for a full day with the NYGASP principals and {{have the opportunity to}} <b>ask</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> that may occur to them.
