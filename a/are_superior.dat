Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information on Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} {{to make it more}} difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used <b>are</b> <b>superior,</b> offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe {{took over}} the white jersey for best young rider from Rigoberto Urán on stage 18. Urán {{finished}} a distant 27th on the day, seven minutes off the pace of stage winner Andy Schleck. Taaramäe's eighth place, three minutes back of Schleck but four minutes the better of Urán, moved him into 11th place overall and into the best young rider's position, by 33 seconds over Pierre Rolland. Rolland won the stage at Alpe d'Huez the next day, with Taaramäe finishing 14th two minutes back. This gave Rolland an advantage of a minute and 33 seconds going into the stage 20 individual time trial, where Taaramäe's skills <b>are</b> <b>superior.</b> Taaramäe indeed finished better than Rolland in the time trial, tenth to Rolland's 21st, but gained only 48 seconds. This was insufficient to win back the white jersey before the final, largely ceremonial stage into Paris on the Tour's final day. Taaramäe finished the Tour in 12th place overall, at a deficit of eleven {{and a half minutes}} to Tour champion Cadel Evans. Moncoutié was not a major factor in any classification, finishing 41st overall and 25th in the mountains classification. Given his result at just 24 years of age, and that he retains eligibility for the white jersey in the 2012 Tour de France, Boyer expressed that he was quite pleased with Taaramäe's performance, and that he expected the Estonian to be a contender for the overall podium at the Tour within two or three years.|$|E

40|$|A {{company could}} grow up {{steadily}} and create different values {{if it makes}} use of resource efficiently. In the growing process of the digital content industry, using resources efficiently and investing innovation activities are the essential factors in operation performance, R&D performance, and human performance. We build the research framework based on the resource-based theory in accordance with innovative technology and human resource, and explore the effect of resources on the performances about sustained advantage. The paper adopts the method of case study to investigate current situations {{about the relationship between}} resource features and performance in digital content industry. The result shows six propositions. (1) An organization with valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable product upgrade could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> operation performance. (2) An organization with valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable IP rights could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> operation performance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to perform an {{evidence}} based review for treatment of unicameral bone cysts. A search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2009) was conducted and the studies were classified according to levels of evidence. This review includes only comparative Level I-III studies. The systematic review identified 16 studies. There is one level I study, one level II study and the remaining 14 studies are level III. Seven of the sixteen studies had statistically different results: three studies indicated that steroid injection <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to bone marrow injection or curettage and bone grafting; one study indicated that cannulated screws <b>were</b> <b>superior</b> to steroid injections; one study indicated resection and myoplasty <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to steroid injection; one study indicated a combination of steroid, demineralized bone matrix and bone marrow aspirate, and curettage and bone grafting <b>were</b> <b>superior</b> to steroid injection; and one study indicated that curettage and bone grafting <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to non-operative immobilization. Based on one Level I study, including a limited number of individuals, steroid injection seems to <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to bone marrow injection. As steroid injections have already demonstrated superiority over bone marrow injections in a randomized clinical trial, the next step would be a prospective trial comparing steroid injections with other treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{prognosis}} of esophageal carcinoma {{has remained}} poor despite improvement of diagnostic modalities. Endosonography and computed tomography were performed for preoperative TNM staging (clinical TNM) of esophageal carcinoma.

Endosonography <b>was</b> also <b>superior</b> to computed tomography in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases. For diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes, however, computed tomography <b>was</b> <b>superior.</b> Endosonography <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> for diagnosing celiac lymph node metastases but less accurate in detecting liver involvement. Endosonography was accurate for clinical TNM staging of esophageal carcinoma. The possibility of performing cytology and biopsy {{will further enhance}} the diagnostic value of endosonography...|$|R
