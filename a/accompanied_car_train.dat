50|$|In October 2004, Transport for London {{announced}} plans to close and replace South Quay station with a station at a new location because of increased use of the Docklands Light Railway. The reason for the move is that the platforms could only accommodate two <b>car</b> <b>trains.</b> They {{would need to be}} lengthened by thirty metres for three <b>car</b> <b>trains</b> but the curves either side of the station precluded extension work.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} South Quay station {{opened in}} 1987, {{and was a}} standard DLR phase 1 elevated station, subsequently extended to {{permit the use of}} 2 <b>car</b> <b>trains.</b> The station was constrained by sharp curves at both ends and could not therefore be further extended on its former site. The DLR's plans to operate 3 <b>car</b> <b>trains</b> on this line therefore included the relocation of this station some distance to the east.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, {{planners}} {{revised the}} design of Line 7 from using the standard 6 <b>car</b> <b>trains</b> to 8 <b>car</b> <b>trains</b> after performing a detailed transport study of the Fatou area. Fatou's population projections were upgraded from 100,000 to 220,000 people and be a significant employment hub in the future. Planners decided that 6 <b>cars</b> <b>trains</b> would have insufficient capacity for the new demand projections. Line 7 was originally planned to use 1500V DC overhead lines to power the longer subway trains. However, the already completed platforms at Beijing West Station assumed the line would use a 750V DC 3rd rail system like Beijing's legacy subway lines and built with vertical clearance for such. The line ultimately used a 1500V DC 3rd rail system as a compromise.|$|R
