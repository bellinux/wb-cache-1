5|$|February 1994: A team of Libyans {{attacked}} bin Laden's home in Sudan. The CIA {{investigated and}} {{reported that they had}} been hired by Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> lying to make bin Laden more amenable to Sudanese interests.|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|Paul Roma began feuding with The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) {{during the}} July 21, 1990, episode of WWF Superstars. Roma was {{attacked}} after a match by Dino Bravo; when The Rockers {{came to the}} ring for the following match, Roma <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> attacking him. The argument turned physical, and Roma was backed up by Hercules. One week later, Roma and Hercules appeared on the Brother Love Show, an interview segment, and announced that they had formed a tag team known as Power and Glory. A match between the two teams was later scheduled for SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{was outraged}} when it {{discovered}} after {{a pair of}} shows in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994 that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band's intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam's plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled {{as a result of}} a Ticketmaster boycott.|$|E
5|$|The Maceo empire soon {{extended}} beyond Galveston Island and gradually expanded throughout Galveston County {{with the family}} owning more than 60 businesses, as well as slot machines throughout the county. Investments in oil speculation helped to diversify the Maceos' portfolio and add to their wealth. Law enforcement sources <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> running the narcotics trade {{as far north as}} Dallas and Sam was even charged, but authorities were never able to make the charges stick, and indeed some sources claim that they were genuinely false.|$|E

5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry was seeing hard times; Lewis <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E
5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E

5|$|Folkvord {{is the son}} {{of school}} {{principal}} Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E

5|$|Three judges testified as {{character}} witnesses: John Peter Barnes (N.D. Ill.) {{on behalf of}} Glasser, Kretske, and Roth; Charles Edgar Woodward (N.D. Ill.) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske. Kaplan and Horton both took the stand, denying that they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske. Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case {{that the government had}} alleged to have been fixed.|$|E
5|$|William was famously {{biased against}} the Knights Templar, whom he {{believed}} to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they {{were not required to}} pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> hindering the Siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them {{to give up their}} wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also <b>accused</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E
