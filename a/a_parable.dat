Price, a TV minister, that was originally broadcast by the Lifetime Network in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when he was actually telling <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error. The suit concluded with an out of court settlement including a public apology by ABC.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

25|$|The {{memories}} of an unnamed elderly tailor form <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> from the distant year {{he worked as}} a village schoolteacher and met his fiancée Eva, a nanny.

25|$|Minae {{and talents}} were never {{actually}} minted: they represented weight measures used for commodities (e.g. grain) {{as well as}} metals like silver or gold. The New Testament mentions both didrachma and, by implication, tetradrachma in context of the Temple tax.

25|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in American Psychologist in 2007, the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media. Specifically, there were not 38 eyewitnesses, the police were contacted at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event. The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> and serves as a dramatic example for students.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Capp {{earned a}} Newsweek cover story. That same year the New Yorker's profile on him {{was so long}} that it ran in {{consecutive}} issues.

25|$|Saint Augustine {{recorded}} that Job had prophesied {{the coming}} of Christ, and Gregory the Great offered him {{as a model of}} right living worthy of respect. The medieval Jewish scholar Maimonides declared his story <b>a</b> <b>parable,</b> and the medieval Christian Thomas Aquinas wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history. In the Reformation Martin Luther explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and John Calvin's Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.|$|E
25|$|Tjalie Robinson {{developed}} a life philosophy that evolves around {{the nature of}} the Hunt, regularly writing about the practice of hunting as <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> for 'real' and 'truthful' living as he saw it. In his stories the Hunt often returns as a theme to intellectually explore 'dangerous' and 'courageous' life and particularly to depict the life and culture of Indos. In the Netherlands he emerged as a sharp critic of assimilation, putting the hunting lifestyle of the Indo opposite to mundane lifestyle in the West.|$|E
25|$|Del Toro {{stated that}} he {{considers}} the story to be <b>a</b> <b>parable,</b> influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film The Devil's Backbone (2001), to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's DVD commentary. The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English, German and French titles refer specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.|$|E

25|$|While on the {{one hand}} this tale tells a tribal family-relations story, and family/tribal history as well, it also seems to be <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> of a typical weather pattern of a southwesterly wind at first {{bringing}} snow, then rain, and also of the melting of a glacier, namely the Place Glacier near Gates Lake at Birken. Thus, it also tells of a migration of people to the area – or a war, depending on how the details of the legend might be read, with Chinook-Wind taking the part of Helen in a First Nations parallel to the Trojan War.|$|E

Khan al-Ahmar is a 13th-century travelers inn for pilgrims on the route between Jerusalem and Mecca via Nabi Musa.|$|E
25|$|Given the show's debut {{during the}} 1980s, {{the height of}} the US AIDS crisis, the work has been {{interpreted}} to be <b>a</b> <b>parable</b> about AIDS. In this interpretation, the Giant's Wife serves as a metaphor for HIV/AIDS, killing good and bad characters indiscriminately and forcing the survivors to band together to stop the threat and move on from the devastation, reflecting the devastation to many communities during the AIDS crisis. When asked about the thematic connection, Sondheim acknowledged that initial audiences interpreted it as an AIDS metaphor, but stated that the work was not intended to be specific.|$|E
