5|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E

5|$|Deir al-Balah {{remained}} in Egyptian hands until around 1150 BC when the Philistines conquered the southern coastal area of Canaan.

5|$|Into modern times, {{his legacy}} has {{remained}} {{more pronounced in}} Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E

5|$|The FBI {{engaged in}} a number of illegal {{practices}} in its pursuit of information on Communists, including burglaries, opening mail and illegal wiretaps. The members of the left-wing National Lawyers Guild were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> attorneys who were willing to defend clients in communist-related cases, and this made the NLG a particular target of Hoover's. The office of this organization was burgled by the FBI at least fourteen times between 1947 and 1951.|$|E

The Abbey Guest house, {{on the east side of}} the Abbey's Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden's House. This house, now a private residence in Abbey Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E

After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> the former president and his wife continued to accept.

5|$|Lithium fluoride, when {{highly enriched}} in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic {{constituent}} of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have low melting points. In addition, 7Li, Be, and F are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.Be and 19F respectively. These two, together with 7Li, {{as well as}} 2H, 11B, 15N, 209Bi, and the stable isotopes of C, and O, are the only nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross sections aside from actinides to serve as major constituents of a molten salt breeder reactor fuel.|$|E

Mangroves are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood.

Packer and Ikanda are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters {{not just because of}} ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.|$|E
5|$|The three Swedish udemas {{served in}} the Finnish {{archipelago}} squadrons throughout the war of 1788–90 by supporting amphibious operations, raiding the opposing Russian archipelago fleet, and protecting the left flank of the Swedish army's operations on the Finnish mainland. Udemas fought in both the First and Second Battles of Svensksund. The latter battle, {{one of the largest}} naval battles ever fought, was a disastrous defeat for the Russians and one of Sweden's greatest naval victories ever; the udema Ingeborg was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> Swedish vessels lost.|$|E

At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side-by-side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|E
