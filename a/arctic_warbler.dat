5|$|From time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed {{records that}} it {{previously}} accepted, {{to ensure they}} are acceptable {{in the light of}} improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. A review of greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this review was to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey Phylloscopus warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common chiffchaffs of the Siberian race tristis. 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. A review of <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics. The review was completed in 1994, although as of 2009, the results had not been published.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the many}} bird {{species in the}} reserve are the chaffinch, the common {{blackbird}} and the willow warbler. The <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus borealis) and the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) also nest there.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky <b>warbler,</b> Radde's <b>warbler,</b> <b>Arctic</b> redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|R
5000|$|The Kamchatka leaf warbler (Phylloscopus examinandus) is {{a species}} of leaf warbler (family Phylloscopidae). It was {{formerly}} included in the [...] "Old World warbler" [...] assemblage. It {{is closely related to}} the <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> and the Japanese leaf warbler, to which it was formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
5000|$|Blithfield {{reservoir}} walks give {{members of}} the public the chance to enjoy the area and its wildlife. [...] The reservoir has been visited by many scarce and rare migrant birds, including an inland <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> (1993), Bonaparte's gull (1994 and 1996), blue-winged teal (1996 and 2000) and squacco heron (2004).|$|E
50|$|Resident {{bird species}} include hazel grouse, black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, goldcrest, Eurasian treecreeper, and spotted nutcracker. Summer {{visitors}} to the Hidaka Mountains include Japanese accentor, Siberian blue robin, Japanese robin, red-flanked bluetail, Siberian thrush, Eastern crowned warbler, narcissus flycatcher, blue-and-white flycatcher, dark-sided flycatcher, grey bunting, and Eurasian bullfinch. Notable bird species that transit the Hidaka mountains are <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> and eyebrowed thrush.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus borealis) is a {{widespread}} leaf warbler in birch or mixed birch forest near water throughout its breeding range in Fennoscandia and northern Asia. It has established a foothold in North America, breeding in Alaska. This warbler is strongly migratory; the entire population winters in southeast Asia. It therefore {{has one of the}} longest migrations of any Old World insectivorous bird.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a typical}} leaf warbler in appearance, grayish-green above and off-white below. The single wing bar found in the {{southern}} and western populations distinguishes them from most similar species (except <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> P. borealis). It is slightly smaller than that species and has a thinner bill, without a dark tip to the lower mandible. A latitude-based analysis of wintering birds indicated that more northerly P. trochiloides are smaller, i.e. this species {{does not seem to}} follow Bergmann's rule.|$|E
50|$|The Denali Highway is an {{important}} birding destination. It offers road access to alpine terrain - not that common in Alaska - and, in the brief birding season there, good viewing {{of a number of}} alpine breeders, including <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler,</b> Smith's Longspur, Long-tailed Jaeger, Whimbrel, Surfbird, Lapland Longspur, Horned Lark, Short-eared Owl, Wandering Tattler, Gyrfalcon and much more. A walk north along The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Maclaren Summit Trail (MP 39) can be very productive. There are also trumpeter swans and various other waterfowl in the lakes and ponds along the route.|$|E
50|$|Its members {{occur in}} Eurasia, ranging into Wallacea and Africa with one species, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{breeding}} as far east as Alaska). Many {{of the species}} breed at temperate and high latitudes in Eurasia and migrate substantial distances to winter in southeastern Asia, India, or Africa. One example is Tickell's leaf warbler, which breeds in scrub at high elevation in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau and then moves down-slope and south to winter in the Himalayan foothills of India and Burma. Most live in forest and scrub and many are canopy or sub-canopy dwellers.|$|E
50|$|It is a brood parasite, laying its eggs in {{the nests}} of other birds. The nests of Phylloscopus warblers such as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler,</b> eastern crowned warbler, willow warbler and {{chiffchaff}} are commonly used. Other hosts include the olive-backed pipit and Asian stubtail. The eggs are smooth, slightly glossy and vary in colour, sometimes mimicking those of the host species. They are incubated for about 12 days. The young cuckoo is born naked and has an orange gape with black patches. Within a few days it pushes the eggs or young of the host out of the nest. Older nestlings have blackish feathers with white fringes; the belly is dark brown with white bands. The young birds fledge after around 17-19 days.|$|E
50|$|The La Mesa Watershed {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of ecosystems {{that is home to}} many indigenous and endemic species of flora and fauna. Approximately 1800 ha are under forest cover and 300 ha are open areas, pastures and areas under cultivation. Several portions of the La Mesa reservoir are shallow with exposed mudflats, swampforest, reed and other swamp vegetation. Its forest serves as an important breeding area for {{a variety of}} wildlife species and birds such as the little heron, black-crowned night heron, osprey, Japanese sparrowhawk, plain bush-hen, common moorhen, Eurasian coot, Philippine coucal, Philippine nightjar, island swiftlet, spotted wood kingfisher, common kingfisher, white-collared kingfisher, Philippine pygmy woodpecker, barn swallow, pied triller, ashy minivet, Philippine bulbul, black-naped oriole, Oriental magpie robin, <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler,</b> grey-streaked flycatcher, pied fantail, yellow-bellied whistler, grey wagtail, brown shrike, olive-backed sunbird, and lowland white-eye.|$|E

40|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> Phylloscopus borealis is one {{of several}} high-latitude Passerines which are widely {{distributed}} across one northern continent but restricted to the Beringian part of the other. Most species with such asymmetric intercontinental ranges are monomorphic across Beringia, suggesting either recent colonization of the second continent or considerable gene flow across the Bering Strait. <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> is the only migratory species in this group that has three different subspecies in Beringia: Ph. b. borealis (Scandinavia to western Beringia, south to Mongolia), Ph. b. xanthodryas (Japan, Sakhalin, Kamchatka, western Beringia), and Ph. b. kennicotti (Alaska). This polymorphism may indicate that <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> has a unique and complex phylogeographic history that differs significantly from other species with similar ranges. Our analyses of complete mtDNA ND 2 sequences of 88 Arctic warblers collected across the species range showed that the clade comprised of birds breeding on Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka Peninsula diverged from the Palearctic/ Beringian clade by 3. 8 % in ND 2 sequence. Beringian birds formed a recently derived clade embedded within the Palearctic clade. Nucleotide diversity declined sharply eastward from Palearctic to western Beringia and then to eastern Beringia. Our data provided no support for currently recognized subspecies. They suggested that the barrier at the western edge of Beringia was crossed by <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> earlier than the Bering Strait resulting in a stepping-stone colonization of Beringia by this species. Gene flow appears to be restricted across the western border of Beringia but not the Bering Strait...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Unlike {{northern}} Europe {{and most}} of northern North America, the Eastern Palearctic and the northwesternmost tip of North America {{are believed to have}} been almost unglaciated during the Quarternary glacial periods. This could have facilitated long-term survival of many organisms in that area. To evaluate this, we studied the phylogeography in east Asia and Alaska of a boreal migratory passerine bird, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler</b> Phylloscopus borealis, and compared our results with published data on especially North American species. Results In a sample of 113 individuals from 18 populations we identified 42 haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which separated into three clades: A - Alaska and mainland Eurasia (except Kamchatka); B - Kamchatka, Sakhalin and Hokkaido; and C - Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (i. e. Japan except Hokkaido). The oldest split among these clades, between A/B and C, is estimated to have taken place sometime between the mid Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and the second divergence, between clades A and B, in the early to mid Pleistocene. Within all of the three main clades, there are signs of population expansion. Conclusions The <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler</b> separated into three main clades in close succession around the Pliocene/Pleistocene border, with the two northern clades diverging last. All three clades probably experienced population bottlenecks during the Pleistocene as a result of range shifts and contractions, but nevertheless survived and maintained their integrities. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic birds are noted to have diversified during the Pliocene. In contrast, avian species or phylogroups presently occupying formerly glaciated North American ground are generally younger. The differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler,</b> indicating common causes of their diversifications. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the autumn migration phenology of nine Siberian breeding songbirds: Thick-billed Warbler (Iduna aedon), Black-browed Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus bistrigiceps), Pallas’s Grasshopper Warbler (Locustella certhiola), Lanceolated Warbler (L. lanceolata), Yellow-browed Warbler (Phylloscopus inornatus), <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Ph. borealis), Dusky Warbler (Ph. fuscatus), Radde’s Warbler (Ph. schwarzi), Two-barred Warbler (Ph. plumbeitarsus) and compared the migration dynamic characteristics with their European occurrence time.

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the study on the avian fauna of the Taebaeksan (Mt.) region of the Seodeukbong of the BaekduDaegan between May and October of 2007 are as follows. A total of 1, 831 {{individuals}} of 71 bird species were observed in the study sites, and based on the average of the highest number of individuals, the most dominant species was the Brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) at 28. 6 individuals (21. 8 %), followed by the Yellow-throated bunting (Emberiza elegans) at 13. 5 individuals (10. 3 %), Long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) at 11. 6 individuals (8. 8 %), Brown-eared bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis) at 7. 6 individuals (5. 8 %), Marsh tit (Parus palustris) at 6. 9 individuals (5. 3 %) and the Great tit (Parus major) at 6. 5 individuals (5. 0 %). This was followed by the dominance, in decreasing order, of the Jay (Garrulus glandarius) at 5. 7 individuals (4. 4 %), Siberian blue robin (Luscinia cyane) at 4. 1 individuals (3. 2 %), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) at 3. 9 individuals (3. 0 %), Varied tit (Parus varius) at 3. 6 individuals (2. 8 %), Crowned willow warbler (Phylloscopus occipitalis) at 3. 5 individuals (2. 7 %) and <b>Arctic</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus borealis) at 2. 9 individuals (2. 2 %).

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} the results of two {{consecutive}} years of breeding observations of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Phylloscopus borealis kennicotti) in interior Alaska, which represent the most extensive collection of information on this species in North America. The aims {{of this study were}} two-fold. First, we described reproductive success across two habitat types. Second, we measured the insulation quality of nests during the second year of our study in order to test whether the substantial variation in nest mass and/or the use of moose hair was related to variation in insulation quality. We observed extremely high rates of nest success in both habitats (collectively 93 % of nests fledged at least two chicks). However, we found nest density to be significantly lower and nest failure rate to be significantly higher on thickly vegetated plots that contained higher proportions of dwarf birch shrubs compared to more open plots dominated by willow shrubs. Both nest mass and moose hair mass varied significantly between habitat types, suggesting that Arctic Warblers are able to build nests from a variety of materials, possibly reflecting local availabilities. However, neither nest mass nor moose hair mass was related to insulation quality, reproductive success, or parental quality within either habitat. In addition, insulation quality was not related to any measure of reproductive success, length of nesting period, or parental size. This suggests that widely varying nest types built by Arctic Warblers are capable of providing sufficient insulation to developing chicks...|$|E
40|$|Birds {{can save}} {{distance}} and {{time on their}} migratory journeys by following great circles rather than rhumblines, but great-circle routes require more complex orientation with changing courses. Flight directions at different places along the route and {{in relation to the}} destination can be used to test whether birds migrate along great circles or rhumblines. Such data have indicated great-circle migration among shorebirds at high latitudes, but no critical tests have been made for passerines. Using tracking radar on board the icebreaker Oden in August 2005, we recorded westerly flight directions of passerine migrants over the Chukchi Sea. The main sector of migratory directions was 237 - 311 degrees centered oil a mean heading direction of 274 degrees. The most likely species to participate in this westward trans-Beringia migration, mainly departing from Alaska, were Eastern Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla Ischutschensis), <b>Arctic</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Phylloscopus borealis kennicotti), Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), and Bluethroat (Luscinia svecica); all except the Bluethroat were recorded from the ship. Observed flight directions agreed with predicted great-circle courses but not with rhumbline courses for three of these four species with winter quarters in Southeast Asia; no definite conclusion could be drawn for the Northern Wheatear (wintering in East Africa). These results support great-circle migration among passerines traveling between Alaska and Old World winter quarters, though the long-distance precision and orientation mechanisms are Still unknown. The relative importance of different evolutionary causes-such as circumvention of geographic barriers, retracing of ancient colonization ways, or distance reduction by great-circle migration-to complex bird migration routes with changing courses remains to be understood.

40|$|Having {{valuable}} high-quality stopover sites {{available for}} migratory birds {{is one of}} the [...] key factors for the success of migration.
