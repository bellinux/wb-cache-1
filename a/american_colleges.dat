5|$|On April 18, 1831, an {{institution}} was established, {{with the support}} of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's merchants, bankers, and traders.

5|$|The NHL Entry Draft is {{held each}} June, {{allowing}} teams to select {{players who have}} turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held.
