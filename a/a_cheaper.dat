The UX32A was designed to be <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> Zenbook with a previous generation Sandy Bridge processor option, lower resolution screen and hybrid drive.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route to main line {{standards}} and extend the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.|$|E

Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race.

5|$|Since recent {{orders of}} new AH-64Ds have been blocked, Israel has pursued {{upgrades}} to its AH-64A fleet. In June 2010, Israel {{decided not to}} upgrade all AH-64As to D configuration, due to funding constraints and lack of U.S. cooperation. In December 2010, the IAF was examining {{the adoption of a}} new missile system as <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> and lightweight complement to the Hellfire missile, either the American Hydra 70 or the Canadian CRV7. In 2013, Israeli AH-64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems. The AH-64As are being upgraded to the AH-64Ai configuration, which is near the AH-64D standard.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA {{proposal}} for exploration of Jupiter and its moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The proposal included a launch date of around 2020 and consists of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. ESA's contribution had encountered funding competition from other ESA projects. However, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), NASA's contribution, was considered by the Planetary Decadal Survey to be too expensive. The survey supported <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> alternative to JEO.|$|E
5|$|The L-100 series entered {{production}} {{at the same time}} as the M-100. It was an economy version, with various cost-cutting changes so the organ could retail for under $1000. The vibrato was a simpler circuit than on other consoles and spinets. Two variations of the vibrato were provided, plus a chorus that mixed various vibrato signals together. The expression pedal, based on <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> design, was not as sophisticated as on the other organs. The L-100 was particularly popular in the UK and sold well, with several notable British musicians using it instead of a B-3 or C-3.|$|E

5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> method than pack mules was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E

5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, {{possibly}} with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco {{before the rest of}} the production was switched to <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> standard cabinet.|$|E

In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> form as The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81 was {{launched}} on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a pre-assembled machine or <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex {{had not been}} an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis {{at the beginning of}} the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.|$|E
5|$|The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge {{commissioned}} by John, Earl Spencer, {{who had recently}} acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping, and boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were <b>a</b> <b>cheaper</b> way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.|$|E
