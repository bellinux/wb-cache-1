5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design <b>and</b> <b>shed</b> new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E
5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films <b>and</b> <b>shed</b> five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same pair of shoes throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet <b>and</b> <b>shed,</b> but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Number 16 is a {{house is}} two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted {{limestone}} walls and a corrugated sheet metal roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet <b>and</b> <b>shed,</b> but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} <b>and</b> <b>shed</b> on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|Vega's {{spectral}} {{class is}} A0V, {{making it a}} blue-tinged white main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core. Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega's main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, {{a tenth of the}} Sun's. The current age of this star is about 455million years, or up to about half its expected total main-sequence lifespan. After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M red giant <b>and</b> <b>shed</b> much of its mass, finally becoming a white dwarf. At present, Vega has more than twice the mass of the Sun and its full luminosity is about 40 times the Sun's value. However, because of its high rate of rotation, the pole is considerably brighter than the equator. Because it is seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity from Earth is notably higher, about 57 times the Sun's value. If Vega is variable, then it may be a Delta Scuti type with a period of about 0.107days.|$|E
