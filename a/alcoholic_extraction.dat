40|$|The lipoids used as antigen in the Wassermann test are {{generally}} obtained by <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction</b> of beef heart muscle. Because {{there is no}} uniform method of preparation, the efficiency of antigens from different laboratories or those made at different times in the same laboratory show wide variations. No matter how prepared, however, there are two important factors which determine {{the sensitivity of the}} extract obtained. The higher the percentage content of active lipoid in an antigen, the more sensitive is the Wassermann test, i. e., the less "reagin " need be circulating in the blood in order to give a positive reaction. The second and by far the more important factor is the amount of cholesterol used to fortify ("sensitize") the antigen. Cholesterol, although in itself inert, increases the sensitivity of the alcoholic tissue extract enormously. The phenomenon has been explained in detail in a previous paper of this series (Eagle, 1930, b). An alcoholic solution of the antigen-lipoids alone, when dropped into water, forms a barely opalescent colloidal suspension in which most of the particles are too small to be seen microscopically. Cholesterol causes a coarser dispersion; relatively few particles of much larger average size are obtained, each consisting of an inert core of cholesterol surrounded by a layer of antigen.

Steroid concentrations of dissected yolk layers were analysed after <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction</b> using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for progesterone, andro-stenedione and testosterone. To monitor the uptake of testosterone into the yolk, radioactive testosterone was injected i. m. into six female quails. The radioactivity of yolk layers of subsequently laid eggs was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Progesterone concentra-tions were highest in the outer layer (median: 2265 nmol/kg). Androstenedione (median: 453 nmol/ kg), as the major androgen, and testosterone (median: 99 nmol/kg) reached their highest concentrations in interior layers, whereas in the centre the concentration of all three hormones was low. No significant variation of steroid levels in yolk layers of subsequently laid eggs was found. The highest radioactivity was detected in the outer yolk layer in those eggs laid 1 day after injection and in subsequently laid eggs was measured nearer to the centre. These results indicated local origin of the steroid hormones especially because of the result that only 0. 1 % of the radioactivity entered the yolk.

The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min, otherwise stated in a number of attempts. The ultra-violet absorbance of the Pandanus' constituents was measured via Multiple Wavelength Detector. From the chromatogram, the major peaks for Pandanus 'compounds were eluted (λ = 220, 260 and 360 nm) and the retention times were recorded. The lower absorbance readings of other minor peaks could be due to various minor secondary metabolites, such as the furolignan. The different elution time depends on the polarity of the composition. In short, Pandanus 'phytochemicals could be obtained via <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction.</b> The utilisation of modern chromatographic applications enables the scientists to discover and subsequently, purify single component of the complex natural mixtures. This finding can be beneficial to the research areas in botanical study, pharmacognostical assessment and biotechnology industry. It is aimed that more Pandanus species could be learnt for the future...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{main purpose}} of this study is to design, {{formulate}} and evaluate the green tea gums with a suitable taste and quality in order to produce an anti-oxidant chewing gum. Materials and Methods: Fresh green tea leaves obtained from Northern Iran for extraction. Maceration is the extraction method that is used in this study. The contents of caffeine, catechin and flavonoids of the hydro alcoholic extract were measured. Various formulations of the 120 mg green tea extract chewing gums with different sweeteners, flavoring agents and various gum bases were prepared afterward release pattern, content uniformity, organoleptic results and other properties were characterized. Results: The contents of caffeine, catechin and flavonoid of the hydro <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction</b> were 207. 32 mg/g, 130. 00 mg/g and 200. 82 mg/g, respectively. Release pattern of green tea chewing gum with different gum base ratios and various sweeteners in phosphate buffer were prepared. A total of 60 persons who were 20 - 30 years of age, participated in our panel test for organoleptic properties such as taste, stiffness, stickiness, etc., Acceptable gum was the one with the same ratio of the used rubber bases. Cinnamon selected as the preferred taste by volunteers. Combination of aspartame, sugar and maltitol has appropriate taste. The effect of various sweetener on release pattern was negligible, on the other hand rubber bases ratio variation, changed the release pattern obviously. Conclusion: The green tea chewing gum with sugar, maltitol and aspartame sweeteners and cinnamon flavor, using the same rubber bases ratio may be a desirable antioxidant product...|$|E
40|$|The serologically active {{substance}} of the Brown-Pearce tumor, a complement-fixing antigen, differs notably from certain other tissue antigens (the Wassermann, Forssman, and organ- and species-specific tissue haptens, for example) {{in the fact that}} it is not effective after <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction</b> of the tissue containing it. Like many of the proteins and viruses it is in-activated upon heating to 65 °C. for 30 minutes; and, like them as well, its activity is lost upon treatment with acid (to pH 4. 5 or lower) or alkali (to pH 11. 5 or higher). Filtration and centrifugation experiments disclosed the fact that the antigen of the Brown-Pearce tumor passed readily through collodion membranes with average pore diameters of 383 mµ and more, but was retained completely by those with average pore diameters of 348 mµ and less. It was thrown down completely or almost completely upon centrifugation at 20, 000 R. P. M. for one hour. The findings indicate that the Brown-Pearce tumor antigen has a large and nearly uniform particle size and weight,—as large as that of many of the viruses. They differentiate it sharply from the generality of "soluble antigens. rdquo; Upon direct comparison, the complement-fixing antigen of the Brown-Pearce tumor was found to be similar in a number of its general traits to the serologically {{active substance}} of the virus-induced papillomas of rabbits, which in turn is intimately associated or identical with the virus responsible for the papillomas. Extracts of the Brown-Pearce tumor containing the serologically active substance in quantity have given rise to no lesions, however, upon injection into normal or tarred rabbits. The significance of the findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of extraction methods: Cold aqueous (CA) hot aqueous (HA) and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction</b> (AE) methods on the hepatotoxic effect of Azadirachta indica bark extract (ABC) was investigated using albino rats. A total of forty eight rats {{were divided into}} three groups of sixteen rats equally for the extraction methods. Each group was subdivided into four rats to represent control, low, medium and high doses of the extract. The control group received no extract while the other groups were administered the various concentrations (doses) intraperitoneally twice daily for seven (7) days before they were all sacrificed under light chloroform and used for the analysis. Parameters determined include glucose, cholesterol and triglycerol. Also alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine amino transferase (ALP) activities were determined. The result shows that glucose levels decreased from 85. 75 + 2. 85 to 65. 00 + 12. 05 in high concentration of C. A. Similar decreases were obtained from HA and AE extraction methods. Cholesterol levels also decreased from 111, 63 + 1. 02 to 53. 75 + 0. 90 in the high concentration CA, and similarly decreased in HA and AE extraction methods. Also triglycerol levels decreased from 66. 49 + 0. 95 to 21. 02 + 0. 30 in the high concentration of CA, and also decreased respectively in both HA and AE extraction methods. Similarly, {{the activities of the}} enzymes decreased in all the extraction methods, and for the different concentrations over the control except for the activities of ALP which increased generally in CA method. This implies that ABE using HA and AE methods in non hepatotoxic while there is possibility of hepatotoxicity of the obstructive type if CA extraction method is used...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} serum albumin on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW 267. 4 macrophages. Crude fraction-V type albumin as well as bovine serum albumin filtrated for endotoxin induced concentration-dependent iNOS expression in macrophages. Accordingly, NO production (estimated by supernatant nitrite) was markedly (up to 10 -fold) increased {{in the presence of}} albumin. Albumin-induced expression of iNOS protein was inhibited by cycloheximide and NO production was abolished after incubation of the cells with an iNOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA). An inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), as well as inhibitors of JAK 2 /STAT and ERK, AG 490 and U 0126, respectively, significantly reduced albumin-induced iNOS expression and NO production, while an inhibitor of the p 38 pathway, SB 203580, did not significantly affect NO production induced by albumin. Both types of serum albumin were contaminated with traces of endotoxin. The endotoxin levels were found not to be sufficient for the observed induction of nitrite production in RAW 267. 4 cells. In addition, the albumin-stimulated induction of iNOS was not reduced by preincubation of albumin-containing media with polymyxin B, a LPS inhibitor. Polymerised albumin fractions were detected in the commercially available albumin tested in this study. A monomeric albumin-rich fraction, separated by ultrafiltration, showed a potent inducing effect on iNOS expression and NO production, while a polymer-rich fraction showed a smaller effect. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) of albumin were not formed by interaction with glucose in incubation medium, as AGE was not increased even after long-time (4 weeks) incubation in albumin-containing media [3. 2 – 4. 4 μg ml− 1 (basal) vs 4. 8 – 5. 6 μg ml− 1 (in glucose-containing media) ]. However, the duration of albumin exposure to glucose influenced the basal stimulatory properties of albumin. Our results suggest that serum albumin fractions, as gained by cold <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction,</b> may include determinants that stimulate or further enhance stimulation of RAW 267. 4 cells and are different from endotoxin, polymeric albumin and AGE...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{extraction}} process {{is an alternative}} to the solvent oil {{extraction process}} from oilseeds. It enables simultaneous recovery of oil and protein. Water extraction of sunflower oil is carried out with a mixer (model Waring Blendor, USA) as batch reactor (seeds/water: 15 / 85). This only apparatus carries out two essential unit operations: conditioning and grinding of sunflower seeds and liquid/solid extraction. However, lixiviation of kernels is incomplete. After five minutes of extraction, the mixture reorganizes by centrifugation in three formulated fractions: the insoluble phase (31. 1 % of the mixture), the hydrophilic phase (61. 4 % of the mixture) and the hydrophobic phase (7. 5 % of the mixture). Oil extraction yield obtained is 46. 6 %. Residual oil content of raffinate is 39. 2 % instead of 49. 7 % in sunflower seeds. Aqueous extraction process also results in an impoverishment of oil cake into water-soluble substances contained initially in kernels: proteins and minerals. Raffinate is on the contrary richer in insoluble proteins and fibers (26. 1 % for cellulose and lignins instead of 17. 1 % in sunflower seeds). An additional stage of extraction would allow a better oil impoverishment of the insoluble phase before its possible use for animal feeding. It would be also possible to upgrade it by thermopressing. Panels obtained have mechanical characteristics comparable with those of other experimental materials. Hydrophilic phase is the dominating fraction. It contains proteins (31. 8 % of dry residue), minerals (8. 2 % of dry residue) and hemicelluloses. Its oil content means that centrifugation does not allow an expedient separation between hydrophilic phase and hydrophobic phase. After concentration of organic substances by ultrafiltration, it is possible to collect proteins by isoelectric precipitation. These water-soluble proteins can be used for their surface-active properties. Hydrophobic phase is an oil-in-water emulsion. It is lighter than hydrophilic phase (0. 94 for its density). Lipids represent 83. 8 % of its dry residue. Its stability is ensured by the presence at interface of natural surface-active agents also extracted during the process, phospholipids and proteins. Demulsification is possible by <b>alcoholic</b> <b>extraction.</b> It enables the edible oil isolation. Oil consumption is possible for human feeding but also for non food uses like biolubricants market. Hydrophobic phase can also be used without any modification for the manufacture of paintings and cosmetics or for the treatment of surfaces with hydrophilic matter...|$|E
