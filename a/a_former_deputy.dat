25|$|Political {{power in}} Shanghai is {{widely seen as}} a {{stepping}} stone to higher positions in the national government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the de facto highest decision-making body in China, including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary), Zhu Rongji (Premier), Wu Bangguo (Chairman of the National People's Congress), Huang Ju (Vice Premier), Xi Jinping (current General Secretary), and Yu Zhengsheng. Zeng Qinghong, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>deputy</b> party secretray of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker. The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption. Officials with ties to the Shanghai administration form a powerful faction in the national government, the so-called Shanghai Clique, which was often thought to compete against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions. Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was a compromise candidate {{between the two groups}} with supporters in both camps.|$|E

500|$|Already {{before the}} {{national}} convention, the entire local party chapter in Osterøy was disestablished, but mainly {{due to the}} European Union controversy.

Eidesvik was {{a former member of}} the central board, and also <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>deputy</b> member of Parliament. The same day former MP and youth wing leader Pål Atle Skjervengen withdrew, commenting that the libertarians [...] "are asked by the party leadership to go to hell". Skjervengen had been criticized by Carl I. Hagen from the rostrum at the national convention. Many years down the road Skjervengen joined the Conservative Party. Harald Eide Ellingsen, member of Stavanger city council, also left.|$|E
500|$|DAAS {{were known}} for {{continuing}} to act, or {{to remain in}} character, during interviews. Much of this was just banter, but they also had serious messages. DAAS were often criticising the media and part of this was to tell outrageous lies to journalists during interviews and attempt to see them published as fact. [...] In {{one of the best-known}} instances of this, the group told British reporters that their namesake, former Australian politician Doug Anthony, was a much-loved Prime Minister of Australia who had been assassinated on 11 November 1975, by right wing extremists. [...] (In fact, Anthony is <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Deputy</b> Prime Minister of Australia who had led the right-of-center National Party of Australia from 1971 to 1984.) The lie was printed in The Times, The Guardian and The Independent. This game continued undetected until in 1990 the group told a reporter that they had been cast in Batman and had become great friends with Jack Nicholson, both lies. [...] The story was reported as fact in newspapers around Australia and appeared as a cover story in the TV guide of Melbourne's Herald Sun before the media realised the hoax.|$|E
