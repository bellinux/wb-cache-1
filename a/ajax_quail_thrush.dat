50|$|Further {{conjecture}} {{has occurred}} through other DNA sequencing studies of birds. A recent study {{has found that}} the Psophodidae (whipbirds and <b>quail</b> <b>thrushes)</b> was polyphyletic, with Cinclosomatidae (<b>quail</b> <b>thrushes)</b> and Ptilorrhoa (jewel-babblers) comprising a lineage unrelated to Psophodes (whipbirds and wedgebills). This too has yet to be confirmed.|$|R

50|$|The Chestnut-breasted <b>Quail</b> <b>Thrush</b> {{is located}} within north western New South Wales, western Queensland {{and much of}} Western Australia. They are {{predominantly}} found within semi-arid zones featuring sparse woody shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and hummock grasses.|$|R
50|$|Male {{and female}} Chestnut-breasted <b>Quail</b> <b>Thrush</b> are {{identifiable}} {{due to their}} different plumage.• Male plumage: glossy black throat; rich rust-red breast band edged with black; eyebrow buff; the rump and back are a deep rust-red, black underside.|$|R

5000|$|Members {{within the}} Psophodes genus {{are closely related}} to the <b>quail</b> <b>thrushes</b> within the Corvida family Cinclosomatidae. The eastern whipbird is known to be one of four species of the Psophodes genus. Rogers and Mulder (2004) [...] also suggest two sub-species of the eastern whipbird, the {{southern}} P. livaceus and the northern P. lateralis. These two sub-species have been identified based on their geographic location within Australia as well as their morphology and plumage.|$|R
50|$|Chestnut-breasted <b>Quail</b> <b>Thrush</b> {{predominantly}} lays two eggs per {{clutch in}} a nest {{located on the}} ground in a slight depression. It is usually 5cm deep and 15 cm wide and constructed of mulga leaves and hop-bush bark Dodonoea adenophora. The nests are hidden amongst a low hop bush which was part of a Mulga-Box association. The nest is usually hidden behind a curtain of leaves and bark. The nests are frequented by related mature and juvenile individuals, however, only the mature individuals feed the young. If juveniles came too close to the nest they are often chased away by the mature male. Juveniles are distinguishable by their smaller size and incomplete bar below the chestnut breast.|$|R
50|$|A quail-thrush is a bird of {{the genus}} Cinclosoma, which {{contains}} eight species. Quail-thrushes are in a different family from either <b>quails</b> or <b>thrushes,</b> but bear some superficial resemblance to them. The genus is found in Australia and New Guinea {{in a variety of}} habitats ranging from rainforest to deserts. The genus is closely related to the jewel-babblers of New Guinea. Seven species were recognised in 2007. A molecular study published in 2015 by Gaynor Dolman and Leo Joseph resulted in the splitting of the chestnut-backed quail-thrush into the chestnut quail-thrush of eastern Australia and the copperback quail-thrush in the west.|$|R
50|$|In his 1807 Almanach des Gourmands, gastronomist Grimod de La Reynière {{presents}} his rôti sans pareil ("roast without equal")—a bustard {{stuffed with}} a turkey, a goose, a pheasant, a chicken, a duck, a guinea fowl, a teal, a woodcock, a partridge, a plover, a lapwing, a <b>quail,</b> a <b>thrush,</b> a lark, an ortolan bunting and a garden warbler—although he states that, since similar roasts were produced by ancient Romans, the rôti sans pareil {{was not entirely}} novel. The final bird is very small but large enough to just hold an olive; it also suggests that, unlike modern multi-bird roasts, there was no stuffing or other packing placed in between the birds.|$|R
40|$|Every year, large {{quantities}} of poultry and game meat are consumed. Thus, efficient techniques to identify the meat species origin are required which interest traders, consumers and organizations. In this study, two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, Cytochrome b (Cyt b) and 12 S ribosomal RNA (12 S rRNA) were tested as putative discrimination markers in samples of raw and processed poultry meat (chicken, turkey, cluck, goose, pheasant, partridge, woodcock, ostrich, <b>quail</b> and song <b>thrush),</b> applying the PCR-RFLP technique with universal primers and ten different restriction enzymes. Digestion of 12 S rRNA by Acil successfully distinguished all avian species, producing species-specific patterns. We conclude that the 12 S rRNA gene is more informative than Cyt b gene for avian species identification purposes. Moderate process treatment did not prevent the species identification, presenting similar patterns with the raw meat. Finally, this method was considered sufficient to detect mixtures of meat, making it a valuable tool for checking possible adulterations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Native Americans ate the berries, {{but because}} the berries have a high tannin content and are thus astringent, they more often chewed them or made them into a cider. They also used the berries to make {{necklaces}} and other decorations, and as bait for fishing. Bark and leaves were used to treat stomachaches, cramps, skin ailments, and sore throats. The bark was often made into a tea to be drunk for these medicinal purposes. Many mammal and bird species feed off the berries, including American robins, cedar waxwings, band-tailed pigeons, varied <b>thrushes,</b> <b>quail,</b> mule deer, raccoons, ring-tailed cats, and bears. Mule deer will also eat the young shoots when the trees are regenerating after fire. It is also important as a nest site for many birds, and in mixed woodland {{it seems to be}} chosen for nestbuilding disproportionately to its numbers. The wood is durable and has a warm color after finishing, so it has become more popular as a flooring material, especially in the Pacific Northwest. [...] An attractive veneer can also be made from the wood. [...] However, because large pieces of madrona lumber warp severely and unpredictably during the drying process, they are not used much. Madrone is burned for firewood, though, since it is a very hard and dense wood that burns long and hot, surpassing even oak in this regard.|$|R
