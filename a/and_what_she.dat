5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|The film cast three Bajau teenagers, Gita Novalista, Eko and Zainal, {{in their}} feature film debuts; {{the three were}} the first Bajau {{to play in a}} feature film. More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E
5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her. Coulter has, on occasion, in defense of her ideas, responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century and the fall of the French monarchy closed the doors on Vallayer-Coster’s still-life ‘era’ and opened them to her new style of florals. It has been argued that this was the {{highlight}} of her career <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is best known for. However, it has also been argued that the flower paintings were futile to her career. Nevertheless, this collection contained floral studies in oil, watercolor and gouache.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} the ship was a severe blow to Britain during these {{early years of the}} war. When the {{officers}} heard the story of Lassie <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did to rescue Cowan, they told it again and again to any reporter who would listen as it was inspirational and heart-warming. In 1938 the novel 'Lassie come home' was published by author Eric Knight and might have been inspired by this tale. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.|$|E

Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} dealt {{primarily}} with Black pursuing various serial killers and other murderers, with only occasional {{references to the}} Group's true purpose. The second season introduced more supernatural occurrences into the show's mythology, with Frank often coming into conflict with forces {{that appeared to be}} apocalyptic or demonic in nature. The final season showed Frank returning to Washington, D.C., to work with the FBI following the death of his wife {{at the hands of the}} Group. He was joined by a new partner, Emma Hollis. Despite Frank's warnings <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> herself observed, Emma ultimately joined the Group. Frank was last seen escaping from Washington, having taken Jordan from school.|$|E
25|$|Mandisa's first {{full-length}} album True Beauty {{was released}} on July 31, 2007.

Mandisa also spent personal time with the album's writers before the songwriting process began, sharing her vision for the project <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> hoped to communicate through the songs.|$|E

25|$|The Buffy series became {{extremely}} popular {{and earned a}} devoted fanbase; Willow's intelligence, shy nature, and vulnerability often resounded strongly with viewers in early seasons. Of the core characters, Willow changes the most, becoming a complex portrayal of a woman whose powers force her to seek balance between {{what is best for}} the people she loves <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is capable of doing. Her character stood out as a positive portrayal of a Jewish woman and at the height of her popularity, she fell in love with another woman, a witch named Tara Maclay. They became one of the first lesbian couples on U.S. television and one of the most positive relationships of the series. Despite not being a titular character, Willow Rosenberg holds the distinction of having the second largest number of appearances on episodes of Buffy and the spin-off series Angel. Alyson Hannigan appeared as Willow in all 144 episodes of Buffy, as well as guest appearances in three episodes of the spinoff Angel, for a total of 147 on screen appearances over the course of both series. She is also featured in an animated series and video game, both of which use Hannigan's voice, and the comics Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight (2007–2011), Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine (2011 - 2013), and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten (2014), which use Hannigan's likeness and continues Willow's storyline following the television series.|$|E
