5|$|A {{full day}} of festivities was held at Times Square to {{celebrate}} {{the arrival of the}} year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by Michael Curry, representing countries entering the new year <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding 2 million spectators.|$|E
25|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} God saw that {{everything}} miraculously came together for Abraham's servant. A daughter of kings, Rebekah, who {{in all her}} life had never gone forth to draw water, went out to draw water <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> And the girl, {{who did not know}} who Abraham's servant was, accepted his proposal to be married to Isaac. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that this happened because she had been destined for him from birth.|$|E
25|$|Prior to CTV's {{purchase}} of the station in 2001, this shifting of primetime programming normally extended to the 7:00 ET / 6:00 CT hour on Sundays, {{in line with the}} practice of American broadcast networks. This meant a local newscast would air at 5:30, followed by primetime, then an extra local newscast at 10:00 p.m. Since 2001, CKY has usually aired local news at 6:00 seven nights a week, including Sundays, regardless of the station's ability to simsub <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> with programming rescheduled as needed to air within the 7-11 p.m. CT block.|$|E

25|$|Blown up by {{dynamite}} last night. It {{was intended}} to have fired the charges at 5 o'clock in the evening; but <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> the sunken vessel was so thickly surrounded by boats, it was deemed inexpedient {{to proceed with the}} work, and 9 o'clock was decided upon. The knowledge that large numbers of fish would be thrown to the surface stunned by the shock influenced the attendance of small boats to a marked degree in the afternoon, and though there were not nearly so many at night the number was larger than was expected, and caution had to be observed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 22 March, MacDonald's troops silently left their {{blocking}} position opposite Arcis-sur-Aube and marched through Dosnon and Sommesous toward Vitry-le-François. Amey was supposed to guard the artillery park, but by a misunderstanding, that general marched his division northwest to Sézanne. Consequently, the Russian Guard Light Cavalry Division attacked the unguarded wagon train, carrying off 15 artillery pieces and 300 prisoners while destroying the gunpowder and spiking 12 cannons. Coming on the scene, Gérard's corps rescued {{what was left of}} MacDonald's artillery park. Despite constant skirmishing with Karl Philipp von Wrede's Allied corps during the day, MacDonald got his troops safely across the Marne late on 23 March. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> Napoleon was in Saint-Dizier with his Guard while Ney was between there and Vitry.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would climb into the house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E

25|$|Lagrange's {{division}} {{angled to}} the left toward Bannay, led by the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment and a marine battalion, while Ricard's division marched straight toward Baye. Olsufiev sent Evstafi Evstafievich Udom with two jäger infantry battalions to clear the French skirmishers out of Baye. As the French pressure increased, Udom was reinforced so {{that he had the}} 10th, 12th, 22nd and 38th Jäger Regiments and six guns. Around 11:00 am Ricard pressed Udom's troops back into Baye and the nearby woods. Olsufiev sent a brigade and six guns to hold the right flank while the bulk of his corps deployed between Baye and Bannay. The French brought 12 guns into action as more and more of their soldiers passed the bridge and arrived on the field. Pierre Pelleport's brigade led Lagrange's division as it assaulted Bannay. At 1:00 pm Olsufiev was still holding out on his forward position. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> the Russian commander held a council of war in which his generals voted for a retreat to Étoges. Olsufiev refused, saying that he had specific orders to hold Champaubert.|$|E
25|$|At the Ministry, a tank {{made its}} way to the main entrance, climbed the steps into the building, and started firing on offices. Sergeant Rafael Veillena, of the Army's Second Division, was killed when he looked out a ninth-floor window. The firing of machine guns and tanks panicked workers in the area, who <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> were making their way to their jobs downtown. A woman working at the State Bank near the Ministry was killed, as well as a couple who were caught in cross-fire. At least 16 people were wounded, four seriously. A group of foreign journalists {{covering}} the reforms carried out by Allende's government was {{caught in the middle of}} the insurrection. While filming the events outside La Moneda, Argentine cameraman Leonardo Henrichsen and his colleague Jan Sandquist were fired at by corporal Héctor Hernán Bustamante Gómez and several soldiers. Henrichsen was fatally shot by a soldier, who was never identified. Before collapsing in the arms of Sandquist, Henrichsen recorded the military foot patrol firing at him. The footage was recovered by Sandquist and showed on the Argentine television on 24 July.|$|E
500|$|Dawes {{covered the}} {{southern}} land route by horseback across Boston Neck {{and over the}} Great Bridge to Lexington. [...] Revere first gave instructions to send a signal to Charlestown using lanterns hung in the steeple of Boston's Old North Church. He then traveled the northern water route, crossing {{the mouth of the}} Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode west to Lexington, warning almost every house along the route. Additional riders were sent north from Charlestown.|$|E

500|$|Akbar's daily {{practice}} of worshiping {{the sun in}} the early morning at his residence in Agra Fort led him to initiate the Jharokha Darshan. Hindus, who used to bathe in the river <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> greeted Akbar when he appeared on the jharokha window for sun worship. It was also the period when Akbar was promoting his liberal religious policy, and in pursuance of this liberal approach he started the Jharokha Darshan. Thereafter, Akbar [...] would religiously start his morning with prayers and then attend the Jharokha Darshan and greet the large audience gathered every day below the jharokha. He would spend about an hour at the jharokha [...] "seeking acceptance of imperial authority as part of popular faith", and after this he would attend the court at the Diwan-i-Aam for two hours attending to administrative duties.|$|E
500|$|General Gage had {{anticipated}} that Lt. Col. Smith's expedition might require reinforcement, so Gage drafted orders for reinforcing units to assemble in Boston at 4 a.m. [...] But in his obsession for secrecy, Gage had sent only one {{copy of the}} orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade, whose servant then left the envelope on a table. [...] Also at about 4 a.m., the British column was within three miles of Lexington, and Lt. Col. Smith now had clear indication that all element of surprise had been lost and that alarm was spreading throughout the countryside. [...] So he sent a rider back to Boston with a request for reinforcements. [...] At about 5 a.m., the rider reached Boston, and the 1st Brigade was ordered to assemble: the line infantry companies of the 4th, 23rd, and 47th Regiments, and a battalion of Royal Marines, {{under the command of}} Earl Percy. Unfortunately for the British, once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander, and the order for the Royal Marines was delivered to the desk of Major John Pitcairn, who was already on the Lexington Common with Smith's column <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> [...] After these delays, Percy's brigade, about 1,000 strong, left Boston at about 8:45 a.m., headed toward Lexington. [...] Along the way, the story is told, they marched to the tune of [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] to taunt the inhabitants of the area. [...] By the Battle of Bunker Hill less than two months later, the song would become a popular anthem for the colonial forces.|$|E
500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E

2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Academy {{seems to have been}} so severe as to make the reconstruction and re-opening of the Academy impossible. When Antiochus returned to Athens from Alexandria, c. 84 BC, he resumed his teaching but not in the Academy. Cicero, who studied under him in 79/8 BC, refers to Antiochus teaching in a gymnasium called Ptolemy. Cicero describes a visit {{to the site of the}} Academy one afternoon, which was [...] "quiet and deserted <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> of the day" ...|$|E

It was known as [...] "Division Street" [...] until 1867. [...] It is the easternmost of the [...] "11 o'clock" [...] roadways laid out in 17th-century Fairfield (their north-northwesterly direction points them like a clock's hands <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> exactly perpendicular to the shoreline of Long Island Sound, that facilitated land distribution).|$|E
2500|$|The Black Friday September 24 gold crash {{caused the}} United States {{financial}} devastation for months.

Obligated {{to make good on}} all debts, the Gold Exchange Bank no longer had enough reserves to cover the mounting debts, while the situation there deteriorated by the hour.

2500|$|The first Midnight Yell {{was held}} in 1932. [...] Two freshmen asked the senior Yell Leaders to hold a midnight {{practice}} so that students would be motivated for the upcoming football game against archrival Texas Longhorns. [...] The Yell Leaders said that while they liked the idea, they [...] couldn't authorize a Yell Practice <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> [...] However, {{they said that they}} just might [...] "show up" [...] at the campus YMCA Building that evening around midnight. [...] The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band met them at the YMCA, and soon the bulk of the student body had gathered. [...] The cadets used railroad flares to light the event, and a tradition was born.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} famous watering {{holes in the}} area contributing to the nightlife, including the Corner Grocery Bar, Toad Hall, the Pendulum, the Midnight Sun, Twin Peaks, and the Elephant Walk. A typical daytime street scene of the period is perhaps best illustrated by mentioning the male belly dancers who could be found holding forth in good weather {{at the corner of}} 18th and Castro on [...] "Hibernia Beach", in front of the financial institution from which it drew its name. Then at night, after the bars closed at 2 AM, the men remaining <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour</b> often would line up along the sidewalk of 18th Street to indicate that they were still available to go home with someone (aka The Meat Rack).|$|E
2500|$|St. Jerome said, [...] "...we must {{set aside}} stated {{hours for the}} duty of praying. Then, should any {{occupation}} keep us away from it, the hour itself will remind us of that duty. As such prayer times everyone knows of the third, sixth and ninth hours, {{the morning and the}} evening hours." [...] It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise Idea as to the composition of the hour of Terce. Most of John Cassian's Institutes III.3 is an exegetical justification for the offices of Terce, Sext, and None, in which he relates each hour to a scriptural passage in which an important event occurs <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>hour.</b> In this way, by directing the monks to scripture, the hours acquired an educational benefit. This was also the view held in Ireland, where the psalms selected for Terce focused on the glorification of the risen Christ.|$|E
