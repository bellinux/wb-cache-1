5|$|In 1968, Cope began doing daily sports {{commentaries on}} what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh. His unique nasal voice, with a {{distinctive}} Pittsburgh area <b>accent,</b> <b>was</b> noticed by the Steelers' brass, and he made his debut {{as a member of}} the Steelers' radio team in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Emily Browning {{was cast}} as Violet Baudelaire when she auditioned at a casting call in Australia. She was sent Handler's {{original}} script when Barry Sonnenfeld {{was planning to}} direct, and she screen tested for the part using an English accent. The actor was not cast until Silberling took over; her character's <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> then changed to American. Browning became {{a fan of the}} books after reading Handler's original script.|$|E
5|$|Poe's {{depiction}} of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical and racist from a modern perspective. Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right. Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee (1836) by Robert Montgomery Bird, which he had reviewed. Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual, but Poe's choice {{to give him a}} speaking role was. Critics and scholars, however, question if Jupiter's <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> authentic or merely comic relief, suggesting it was not similar to accents used by blacks in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah.|$|E
50|$|Phonetically, {{both of the}} tonal <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> falling; {{the falling}} <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> {{realized}} as an even decrease in intensity and pitch, whereas the broken <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> realized as a sudden decrease in intensity and pitch.|$|R
50|$|In (3) and (4), {{the pitch}} <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> marked in bold. In (3), the pitch <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> placed on dog {{but the entire}} noun phrase a grey dog is under focus. In (4), the pitch <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> also placed on dog but only the noun dog is under focus. In (5), pitch <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> placed on grey and only the {{adjective}} grey is under focus.|$|R
50|$|In Hokuriku region, various pitch <b>accents</b> can <b>be</b> heard. Varieties of Kyoto-Osaka type <b>accent</b> <b>are</b> {{heard in}} Sado, Toyama and eastern Fukui such as Katsuyama and Ōno. In Izumi, easternmost village of Fukui, Tokyo type <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> heard. In central Fukui such as Fukui city and Echizen, {{monotonous}} <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> heard - {{there is no}} contrast between words based on accent. In Noto, varieties of Kyoto-Osaka type, monotonous accent and Tokyo type <b>accent</b> <b>are</b> heard to each village. In Kaga and part of Fukui, an intermediate accent between Tokyo type and Kyoto-Osaka type is heard.|$|R
25|$|The <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> mobile in {{that its}} {{position}} could potentially vary among closely related words {{within a single}} paradigm.|$|E
25|$|An early {{precursor}} of the acute <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> the apex, used in Latin inscriptions to mark long vowels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> free in that {{it could}} occur on any syllable, and was phonemic (i.e. its {{position}} could not be automatically predicted).|$|E
5000|$|Standard rules {{governing}} {{the presence of}} <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> based on word endings and {{the position of the}} stressed syllable. In particular, <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> expected for: ...|$|R
2500|$|In a word {{of three}} or more syllables, {{the weight of the}} penult determines where the <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> placed. If the penult <b>is</b> light, <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> placed on the antepenult; if it <b>is</b> heavy, <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> placed on the penult. Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark [...] before the {{stressed}} syllable.|$|R

25|$|Short falling (ȁ): This {{indicates}} the Balto-Slavic short accent. In Late Common Slavic, this <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> lengthened in monosyllables (see preceding entry).|$|E
25|$|The {{circumflex}} <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> {{also used}} to indicate French vowels deriving from Greek eta (η), but this practice has not survived in modern orthography. For example, the spelling théorême (θεώρημα) was later replaced by théorème.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Sámi, {{an acute}} <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> {{placed over the}} {{corresponding}} Latin letter to represent the letters peculiar to this language (Áá, Čč, Đđ, Ŋŋ, Šš, Ŧŧ, Žž) when typing {{when there was no}} way of entering these letters correctly otherwise.|$|E
50|$|In Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian, double grave <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> used to {{indicate}} a short falling tone, though in discussion of Slovenian, a single grave <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> also often used for this purpose. The double grave <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> found in both Latin and Cyrillic; however, it is not used in the everyday orthography of either language, only in discussions of the phonology of these languages.|$|R
5000|$|Languages vary {{in terms}} of whether pitch <b>accents</b> must <b>be</b> {{associated}} with syllables that are perceived as prominent or stressed. For example, in French and Indonesian, pitch <b>accents</b> may <b>be</b> associated with syllables that are not acoustically stressed, while in English and Swedish, syllables that receive pitch <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> also stressed. [...] Languages also vary {{in terms of}} whether pitch <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> assigned lexically or post-lexically. Lexical pitch <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> associated with particular syllables within words in the lexicon, and can serve to distinguish between segmentally similar words. Post-lexical pitch <b>accents</b> <b>are</b> assigned to words in phrases according to their context in the sentence and conversation. Within this word, the pitch <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> associated with the syllable marked as metrically strong in the lexicon. Post-lexical pitch accents do not change the identity of the word, but rather how the word fits into the conversation. The stress/no-stress distinction and the lexical/post-lexical distinction create a typology of languages with regards to their use of pitch accents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Accent</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{a feature of}} the entire syllable rather than of the nucleus only. One accent occurs with each syllable. Note that the functional load of <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> light—only some 40 lexical pairs with contrastive <b>accents</b> have <b>been</b> found and few grammatical contrasts <b>are</b> marked by <b>accent</b> alone.|$|R
25|$|For {{the role}} of Kurt Muller, Wallis wanted Charles Boyer. He, however, felt his French <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> wrong for the character, so the {{producer}} decided to cast Paul Lukas, who had originated the role on Broadway and had been honored by the Drama League of New York for his performance.|$|E
25|$|Walker's {{distinctive}} broad Australian <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> parodied {{in several}} albums by The Twelfth Man (Billy Birmingham), including being featured {{as the central}} character on the 1994 album Wired World of Sports II.

25|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina Buenos Aires and Rosario residents speak with an intonation most closely resembling Neapolitan. The researchers note this as a relatively recent phenomenon, starting {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century with the main wave of Southern Italian immigration. Before that, the porteño <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> more similar to that of Spain, especially Andalusia.|$|E
50|$|In the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area, the <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} a London <b>accent,</b> and it <b>is</b> often mistaken as one. This {{is because of the}} {{overflow}} of Londoners and their subsequent generations in the area. The 'Lutonian' <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> not as strong as an accent from Essex.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{varieties}} of the New Orleans <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> sometimes identified as the Yat dialect, from the greeting [...] "Where y'at?" [...] This distinctive <b>accent</b> <b>is</b> dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.|$|R

25|$|The <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> {{primarily}} {{confined to}} Liverpool until the 1950s when slum clearance {{in the city}} resulted in migration of the populace into new pre-war and post-war developments in surrounding areas of Merseyside. The continued development {{of the city and}} its urban areas has brought the accent into contact with areas not historically associated with Liverpool such as Prescot, Whiston and Rainhill in Merseyside and Widnes, Runcorn and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of stress {{did not change}} from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to be stressed on the same syllable they were before. However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin {{the place of the}} <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> predictable from the structure of the word, it was no longer so in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.|$|E
25|$|She usually wore hairpieces for {{her role}} as Troi. Sirtis' real hair was {{slightly}} shorter, and although curly, was not as bouffant as her character's. However, Sirtis' real hair was used in the pilot episode, and also in the first six episodes of season six, in which Troi sported a more natural looking pony-tailed style. She was also asked to create an accent (described as a mixture of Eastern European and Israeli) for her character, although her natural accent is Cockney. Over time, the <b>accent</b> <b>was</b> adjusted and became more Americanized.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was originally written as English, until producer Hastie felt that an American character would enhance {{the chance of}} overseas sales.

500|$|Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots {{made him}} target for some mild jeering.
