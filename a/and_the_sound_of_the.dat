5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunes with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} take severe damage, the screen will turn red <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character's {{heartbeat}} will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player {{must find a}} way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step {{in the creation of}} the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E

25|$|The Opening Ceremony {{culminated in}} the end of the torch relay, a {{tradition}} begun when Berlin hosted the games in 1936. Before the torch came into the stadium, a three rings arose {{from the center of the}} stadium that simulated a globe. This segment preceding the torch's arrival honored the first global torch relay that was begun by Athens 2004. Actors, suspended on cables, started rising out of the crowd and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heartbeat accompanied by thunderous cheers and applause met the torch's final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.|$|E

500|$|The Yoke {{nuclear device}} used a levitated all-uranium-235 core. It was detonated on Aomon just before sunrise on 1 May 1948 at 06:09, a day late due to {{unfavorable}} winds. The observers saw a similar flash {{and felt the}} same heat as the X-Ray blast, but the [...] wide condensation cloud was larger, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion more forceful.

500|$|Ben Burtt, {{the sound}} effects supervisor, made {{extensive}} use of traditional foley work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of the Republic serials. He selected a [...]30-30 Winchester rifle {{for the sound of}} Jones' pistol. Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and baseball gloves with a baseball bat to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding lid on a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous Wilhelm scream when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on Star Wars. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.|$|E
500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the mediastinum, the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise. [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of air leak into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E

2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} flame {{is the third}} possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter {{than the other two}} flames because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an {{oxidizing flame}} because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an oxidizing flame, the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge, gets pinched and smaller at the tip, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame gets harsh. A slightly oxidizing flame is used in braze-welding and bronze-surfacing while a more strongly oxidizing flame is used in fusion welding certain brasses and bronzes ...|$|E
