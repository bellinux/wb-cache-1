5|$|Most helium on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E

The ability of immobilised lipase (Lipozyme IM- 77) from Rhizomucor miehei to {{catalyse}} the transesterification of hexanol and tributyrin was investigated in this study. Response surface methodology (RSM) and five-level-five-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction time (2 to 10 h), temperature (25 to 65 °C), enzyme amount (10 to 50 %), substrate <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> mol) ratio of tributyrin to hexanol (1 : 1 to 3 : 1), and added water content (0 to 20 %), on percentage <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> mol) conversion of hexyl butyrate by transesterification.

5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, debtors in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their creditors. Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small <b>amounts.</b> <b>In</b> the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to have been there for 30years.|$|E
