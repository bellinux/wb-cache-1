This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> embattled France had given the United States the statue.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually {{no way to know}} exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they would remember the taunts.|$|E

5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> both grids are present in the campus.|$|E

25|$|Royal Holloway's {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of the Royal Holloway shield and its surrounding elements. There are three crescents shown on the coat of arms, which are taken from Thomas Holloway's own coat of arms. Taken from the Bedford coat of arms, the field is coloured black and gold in a chequered design, {{with the addition of}} ermine spots (feather-like symbols representing ermine tails) from the Royal Holloway coat. Placed between two black lozenges, there is a lamp of learning. Traditionally, the lozenge is worn on the arm of unmarried women or widows, which places significance on the coat of arms' lozenges as it acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the colleges were founded for women. Below, the motto is displayed which is taken from the arms of Bedford College, and reads esse quam videri.|$|E
25|$|Balls {{wear out}} quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine {{games with the}} first change {{occurring}} after only seven games, because {{the first set of}} balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up. As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they are using new balls. However, in ITF tournaments like Fed Cup, the balls are changed in a 9–11 style. Continuity of the balls' condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted {{unanimously}} to erect a memorial for the ‘comfort women’ of World War II. The memorial itself would stand <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the event did in fact happen, despite repeated denials by the Japanese government, {{and it would be}} a reminder never to let another atrocity like it happen again. However some Japanese members of the community showed concerns over the memorial, believing that it would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community. One of these critics was Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, a large city in Japan. Hashimoto claims in his letter written to the Board of Supervisors that the memorial should be “broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world”. Japanese residents of the area have also shown concerns over the memorial as many believe that it projects hatred towards the Japanese and focuses solely on an event in committed by the Japanese during wartime instead of promoting awareness and future prevention.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the smaller}} prophet figures from Bourges also survive, {{dispersed}} amongst public and private collections. Stylistic differences between these figures serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> useful <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> northern European sculpture of this period was normally a team effort. Workshop masters like Beauneveu would set the standard and dictate the overall style but on any large project, one can usually distinguish the presence of multiple distinct craftsmen.|$|R

[...] The release noted Franklin's reputation for thrift, and expressed hope that the half dollar would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> spare cash {{should be used to}} purchase savings bonds and savings stamps.

Additionally, its lyrics detail losing faith during troubling {{times in his}} life, but {{ultimately}} result in him gaining more. It was generally well received by music critics, who applauded Shelton's change in musical genre. Some critics even positively noted his maturity through the track. A black and white music video was filmed for the track, and premiered on May 19, 2016.

500|$|Following the {{conflict}} the rape victims {{were seen as}} a symbol of [...] "social pollution" [...] and shame. Few were able to return to families or old homes because of this. [...] Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called the victims birangona ("heroine"), but this served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> these women were now deemed socially unacceptable as they were [...] "dishonored", and the term became associated with barangona ("prostitute"). The official strategy of marrying the women off and encouraging them to be seen as war heroines failed as few men came forward, and those who did expected the state to provide a large dowry. Those women who did marry were usually mistreated, and the majority of men, once having received a dowry, abandoned their wives.|$|E
