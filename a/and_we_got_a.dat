500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. A {{critic for}} PopSugar.com called [...] "Pandora" [...] a [...] "fantastic episode" [...] and {{was pleased that}} Pandora's character [...] "graduated from being random light relief <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> real insight into her life". They praised each of the [...] "superb" [...] guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela [...] "brilliantly". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "probably the most outrageous of the series to date". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie [...] "set things up nicely" [...] for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included [...] "a lot of confusing straight relationship drama" [...] and {{felt like she was}} [...] "stuck in high school hell". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was [...] "so ridiculous it's kind of funny" [...] and likened Skins to [...] "Gossip Girl on crack". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast [...] "most of these kids were so unlikable", though he attributed this to the series [...] "show us their weaknesses". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was [...] "more representative of youth than most of the other characters". One reviewer for lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com called the episode [...] "must-see TV", while another reviewer expressed disapproval of the use of Katy Perry's song, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", in promotional videos for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Thick as Thieves", penned by {{the band}} with Gabriel, was {{described}} by Emmy Mack of Music Feeds as a track that [...] "thumps along" [...] with a [...] "tribal-style tom beat, wild west guitar arpeggios, [...] an Electric Light Orchestra-style bassline". Mandagi, who himself described the track as a [...] "jangly guitar song", stated {{that he had the}} idea for the song's guitar riff for years, long before he had sat down with guitarist Joseph Greer and [...] "worked it out in his old flat one day." [...] Lyrically, the album was motivated by various experiences in each of the band members' personal lives. One such example is in the album's second track, [...] "So Much Sky", inspired by bassist Jonathon Aherne and Mandagi's trip to Tanzania, meeting with the Massai tribe as part of an initiative with Faces4Hope, a christian charity organization supporting villages and tribes in East Africa, with whom the band were involved with. The band had written the song mostly {{in the image of the}} Massai, their village, and the view of the nearby Mount Kilimanjaro. Mandagi explained, [...] "being out in the open plains and waking up in the morning and seeing Mount Kilimanjaro popping up just above the clouds. It was a really inspirational experience <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> song out of it." [...] The third track on the album, [...] "Burn", penned by the band with Parker, was noted by Dundas as one of the band's favorites on the record. Written early on in the recording sessions, [...] "Burn" [...] was built from two different compositions which were, according to Dundas, [...] "gradually morphed together as one as we were recording." [...] Kim Taylor Bennett of Noisey compared the track to [...] "U2's sky-scraping bombast with a bass drum thwack and crash reminiscent of [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by The Ronettes." [...] Mandagi touts [...] "Alive", the sixth track on Thick as Thieves, as the band's [...] "sexiest number for sure", with [...] "all swagger and menacing bass lines." [...] The song was further described by Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit as one with a [...] "quivering bassline and sharp, punchy beats, and a to-the-rafters chorus erupts to relieve the tension." ...|$|E

The pilot had told me the water was deep, up to the rocks of the bluff; and we hugged the land as close as possible, in rounding the point. At the next moment the ship was in sight, distant less than a hundred fathoms. I saw we had good way, and, three minutes later, I ordered the fore-sail brailed. At the same instant I walked forward. So near were we, that the flapping of the canvass was heard in the ship, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> hail. A mystified answer followed, and then crash came our bows along those of the Crisis. [...] "Hurrah! for the old craft!" [...] shouted our men, and aboard we tumbled in a body.

60|$|We {{had cleared}} the Straits of Sunda {{early in the}} morning, and had made a pretty fair run {{in the course of}} the day, though most of the time in thick weather. Just as the sun set, however, the horizon became clear, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sight of two small sail {{seemingly}} heading in towards the coast of Sumatra, proas by their rig and dimensions. They were so distant, and were so evidently steering for the land, that no one gave them much thought, or bestowed on them any particular attention. Proas in that quarter were usually distrusted by ships, it is true; but the sea is full of them, and far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence. Then it became dark soon after these craft were seen, and night shut them in. An hour after the sun had set, the wind fell to a light air, that just kept steerage-way on the ship. Fortunately, the John was not only fast, but she minded her helm, as a light-footed girl turns in a lively dance. I never was in a better-steering ship, most especially in moderate weather.|$|E

The cleverest women lose {{the use of their}} wits in nine cases out of ten where there's a new dress in the case, and even Miss Gwilt was rash enough to go back. That was all we wanted. One of the women from our office helped to try on her new gown, and put her in the right {{position}} to be seen by one of our men behind the door. He instantly suspected who she was, on the strength of what he had been told of her; for she's a famous woman in her way. Of course, we didn't trust to that. We traced her to her new address; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> man from Scotland Yard, who was certain to know her, if our own man's idea was the right one. The man from Scotland Yard turned milliner's lad for the occasion, and took her gown home. He saw her in the passage, and identified her in an instant. You're in luck, I can tell you. Miss Gwilt's a public character. If we had had a less notorious woman to deal with, she might have cost us weeks of inquiry, and you might have had to pay hundreds of pounds. A day did it in Miss Gwilt's case; and another day put the whole story of her life, in black and white, into my hand. There it is at the present moment, old gentleman, in my black bag." ...|$|E

Presently, I said I should ride back for my mother, but it thundered again; Belle is afraid of thunder, and I decided to see her through the forest before I returned for my other hen--I may say, my other wet hen. About the middle of the wood, where it is roughest and steepest, we met three pack-horses with barrels of lime-juice. I piloted Belle past these--it is not very easy in such a road--and then passed them again myself, to pilot my mother. This effected, it began to thunder again, so I rode on hard after Belle.

"I {{said many}} a good ship, Captain Ludlow, and not good navigator.--No--no--your thorough-bred knows the {{difference}} between green water and blue, {{as well as between}} a hand-lead and the deep-sea. But I remember to have missed an observation, once, when running for Genoa, before a mistrail. There was a likelihood of making our land-fall in the night, and the greater the need of knowing the ship's position. I have often thought, Sir, that the ocean was like human life,--a blind track for all that is ahead, and none of the clearest as respects that which has been passed over. Many a man runs headlong to his own destruction, and many a ship steers for a reef under a press of canvas. To-morrow is a fog, into which none of us can see; and even the present time is little better than thick weather, into which we look without getting much information. Well, as I was observing, here lay our course, with the wind as near aft as need be, blowing much as at present; for your French mistrail has a family likeness to the American norther. We had the main-top-gallant-sail set, without studding-sails, for we began to think of the deep bight in which Genoa is stowed, and the sun had dipped more than an hour. As our good fortune would have it, clouds and mistrails do not agree long, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> clear horizon. Here lay a mountain of snow, northerly, a little west, and there lay another, southerly with easting. The best ship in Queen Anne's navy could not have fetched either in a day's run, and yet there we saw them, as plainly as if anchored under their lee! A look at the chart soon gave us an insight into our situation. The first were the Alps, as they call them, being as I suppose the French for apes, of which there are no doubt plenty in those regions; and the other were the highlands of Corsica, both being as white, in midsummer, as the hair of a man of fourscore. You see, Sir, we had only to set the two, by compass, to know, within a league or two, where we were.

He was indignant and refused; but his elder sister had overheard me and came {{to the head of the}} stairs and forbade him to stir, and that so vexed him that he shouted to the kitchen for his sea-boots. He came with me in great gloom for he had people's respect, he declared, and nobody so far had said that he was mad as they said I was, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> very sleepy boy out of his bed in the village and set up sail.

I rolled myself in the main-sail and went to sleep for I could sleep anywhere in those days. I was awakened towards dawn to see my cousin and the boy turning out their pockets for money and to rummage in my own pockets. A boat was rowing in from Roughley with fish and they wanted to buy some and would pretend they had caught it, but all our pockets were empty. It was for the poem that became fifteen years afterwards [...] "The Shadowy Waters" [...] that I had wanted the birds' cries, and it had been full of observation had I been able to write it when I first planned it. I had found again the windy light that moved me when a child. I persuaded myself that I had a passion for the dawn, and this passion, though mainly histrionic like a child's play, an ambitious game, had moments of sincerity. Years afterwards when I had finished [...] "The Wanderings of Oisin," [...] dissatisfied with its yellow and its dull green, with all that overcharged colour inherited from the romantic movement, I deliberately reshaped my style, deliberately sought out an impression as of cold light and tumbling clouds. I cast off traditional metaphors and loosened my rhythm, and recognizing that all the criticism of life known to me was alien and English, became as emotional as possible but with an emotion which I described to myself as cold.
