40|$|Abstract—Linear Quadratic (LQ) optimal {{boundary}} {{control of}} a 2 D heat flow is studied. The design is carried out on a reduced order model of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) process. For this purpose, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique is utilized and the Low Dimensional (LD) model is derived. The boundary controller is developed using the state information obtained via an observer. An infinite dimensional version of the observer is developed first and its finite dimensional counterpart is derived <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> procedure. Having obtained {{the states of the}} system, a LQ optimal control approach is followed to demonstrate that the entire design works satisfactorily under the presence of noise, uncertainty and disturbances. The contribution of the paper is to draw a clear path between a spatially continuous process and an optimal boundary controller minimizing a quadratic cost, and the emphasis on the merits of POD based designs.

As a check {{and in order to}} compare results, the analyses of grain of cultivars not derived at the Maize Research Institute, Zemun Polje, were also carried out. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> the protein content, the cultivar Nena stands out among ZP soya bean genotypes. The content of the grain total protein and water soluble proteins amounted to 43. 34 % and 34. 97 %, respectively. The cultivar Lana {{was also one of the}} best analysed ZP genotypes. A genotype with recessive genes for the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor was derived by conventional selection methods and therefore, grain of this cultivar has an extremely low content of the total trypsin inhibitor amounting, on the average, to 14.

40|$|This project {{consists}} {{of developing a}} Location Allocation model that focuses on determining the locations of relief supply Points of Distribution (PODs) after a natural disaster and how to assign demand points <b>to</b> them. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> FEMA, <b>PODs</b> are â€œcentralized locations where the public picks up life sustaining commodities following a disaster or emergencyâ€ [1]. After each disaster, decisions {{have to be made}} to ensure a good delivery of resources in a timely manner. The road infrastructure may be damaged due to the disaster. Some roads might become inoperable, and some bridges are expected to fail. The model studied in this research makes decisions about the locations of PODs after knowing the real-time information about the road infrastructure and magnitude of demand {{at the beginning of each}} period of the planning horizon. A case study developed based on the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is used to demonstrate the usefulness of our model. Our study area is limited to the nineteen counties in Arkansas that are most likely to be affected by the New Madrid earthquake. Many lives can be saved if a good logistics plan exists. A good humanitarian logistics plan can reduce the suffering of the affected population and the cost associated with providing supplies. This project extends previous work completed as part of the Department of Transportation Mack Blackwell Transportation Center Project 3028, â€œModels for Disaster Relief Shelter Location and Supply Routingâ€ [2]. We examine 96 potential disaster scenarios by alternating problem parameters. We are considering four road networks instances, three budgets, four demand patterns, and two POD capacities.

40|$|Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] is an {{important}} legume crop in South Asia, East and southern Africa, and the Caribbean. Pod fly (Melanagromyza obtusa Malloch) and pod wasp (Tanaostigmodes cajaninae La Salle) are important constraints to increase the production and productivity of pigeonpea under subsistence farming conditions. Host plant-resistance {{can be used as}} {{an important}} component for the management of these pests, and therefore, we evaluated 28 accessions of wild relatives of pigeonpea for resistance to these pests. There were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the relative susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>pod</b> fly and pod wasp damage. Accessions belonging to Cajanus scarabaeoides (L.)

We investigated haemodynamic behaviour after {{a liver transplant}} {{to see if it}} can predict survival to discharge from the hospital. Methods: electronic records of Haemodynamic parameters and laboratory investigations of 95 patients of living donor liver transplant (LDLT) were retrospectively analysed. Results: Twenty-three patients were operated for acute liver failure (ALF) and 72 patients for chronic liver disease (CLD). Eight patients of CLD and four of ALF did not survive. CLD patients had statistically significant rise in systolic blood pressure from the post-operative day (<b>POD)</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 4 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from <b>POD</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 6. Heart rate (HR) significantly decreased from <b>POD</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 5. Haemodynamic parameters returned to baseline values within 20 days. Diastolic HTN had a positive predictive value of 100 % for survival with 100 % sensitivity and specificity. Systolic HTN had a positive predictive value of 100 % for survival (sensitivity- 89 %, specificity- 100 %). ALF patients had a significant decrease in HR from <b>POD</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 10. Bradycardia (HR ≤ 60 /min) had a positive predictive value of 100 % for survival with a sensitivity of 45 % and 58 % in CLD and ALF, respectively, with a specificity of 100 % in both the groups. Non-survivors had no significant change in haemodynamics. In CLD group, International Normalised Ratio had statistically significant, strong negative correlation with DBP.

40|$|The legume pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera, {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating pests of pigeonpea. High levels of {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>pod</b> borer have been reported in the wild relative of pigeonpea, Cajanus scarabaeoides. Trichomes (their type, orientation, density and length) and their exudates on pod wall surface play an important role in the ovipositional behavior and host selection process of insect herbivores. They have been widely exploited as an insect defense mechanism in number of crops. In the present investigation, inheritance of resistance <b>to</b> <b>pod</b> borer and different types of trichomes (A, B, C and D) on the pod wall surface in the parents (C. cajan and C. scarabaeoides) and their F 1, F 2, BC 1 (C. cajan × F 1), and F 3 generations has been studied. Trichomes of the wild parents (high density of the non-glandular trichomes C and D, and glandular trichome B and low density of glandular trichome A) were dominant over the trichome features of C. cajan. A single dominant gene as indicated by the segregation patterns individually will govern each trait in the F 2 and backcross generation.

Similar results were obtained for pod borer resistance under no-choice conditions. Resistance <b>to</b> <b>pod</b> borer and trichomes associated with it (low density of type A trichome and high density of type C) are governed individually by a dominant allele of a single gene in C. scarabaeoides.

The patients were randomized to use the foot pump (n = 58) and not to use the foot pump (n = 62). Both groups were given prophylactic edoxaban. Primary outcomes were any DVT as detected by bilateral ultrasonography up to postoperative day 10 (POD 10) and pulmonary embolism (PE) up <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 28. The safety outcomes were bleeding and death of any cause up <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 28. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured before TKA and on POD 10 after TKA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) -class anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies were measured using an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The incidences of any DVT up <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 28 were 31. 0 % and 17. 7 % in patients with or without the foot pump, respectively. The incidences of major bleeding up <b>to</b> <b>POD</b> 28 were 5. 1 % and 4. 8 % in patients with or without the foot pump, respectively. Foot pump use did not significantly reduce the incidence of DVTs in patients undergoing TKA under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis. Although seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was confirmed in one-fourth of patients, the seroconversion rates did not differ between patients with (20. 7 %) or without (25. 8 %) foot pump use. This study shows that the A-V Impulse system foot pump did not affect the incidence of DVT under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing TKA. Seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was detected in a significant number of patients who underwent TKA under antithrombotic prophylaxis using edoxaban. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 986 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 9 月 20 日Author: Sakai, Tatsuya; Izumi, Masahiro; Kumagai, Kenji; Kidera, Kenichi; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Asahara, Tomohiko; Kozuru, Hideko; Jiuchi, Yuka; Mawatari, Masaaki; Osaki, Makoto; Motokawa, Satoru; Migita, KiyoshiCitation: Medicine, 95 (1), e 2247; 201...|$|R
