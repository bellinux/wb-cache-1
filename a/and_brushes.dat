5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|In 1788, aged 31, Blake {{experimented with}} relief etching, a method {{he used to}} produce most of his books, paintings, {{pamphlets}} and poems. The process is {{also referred to as}} illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).|$|E
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

The storm spawns 3tornadoes, one of which destroys 25houses in Pompano Beach. 678homes are destroyed or severely damaged, and damage across the state totals $5.5million (1948USD, $49million 2008USD). The hurricane injures 42, though no deaths are reported in the state.|$|E
500|$|The poor knights {{originally}} wore red mantles, each {{of which}} bore St George's Cross, but did not depict the Garter. Queen Elizabeth I replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns, but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under King Charles I. When the knights were renamed, the mantles were abandoned. The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an [...] "army officer on the unattached list": black trousers with red stripe, a red double-breasted swallow-tailed coat, gold epaulets <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> a cocked hat with a plume, and a sword on a white sash.|$|E

His setup {{has always been}} simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal {{and a pair of}} hi-hats, with an occasional third crash: [...] "I've got four drums.

500|$|The cleanup was {{hampered}} by two significant factors: the unexpected base surge {{and the lack}} of a viable cleanup plan. [...] It was understood that if the water column fell back into the lagoon, which it did, any ships that were drenched by falling water might be contaminated beyond redemption. Nobody expected that to happen to almost the entire target fleet. [...] No decontamination procedures had been tested in advance to see if they would work and to measure the potential risk to personnel. [...] In the absence of a decontamination protocol, the ships were cleaned using traditional deck-scrubbing methods: hoses, mops, <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> with water, soap, and lye. The sailors had no protective clothing.|$|E
500|$|Zigrasimecia tonsora is {{only known}} {{from a single}} {{specimen}}, the holotype, specimen number JZC Bu-159. At the time of description, the specimen was residing in the private collection of James Zigras and only available for study through the American Museum of Natural History. [...] The solitary adult fossil is composed of a mostly-complete dealate adult female which has been preserved as an inclusion in transparent chunks of deep yellow and relatively clear Burmese amber. The amber specimen was recovered from deposits in Kachin State, [...] west of Myitkyina town in Myanmar. Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U-Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 99million years old, close to the Aptian– Cenomanian boundary. The fossil was first studied by palaeoentomologists Phillip Barden and David Grimaldi, both of the AMNH. Barden and Grimaldi's 2013 type description of the new genus and species {{was published in the}} online journal Zootaxa. The genus name Zigrasimecia is a patronym which was coined as a combination of James Zigras' last name and -mecia which is a commonly used suffix in ant generic names. The specific epithet tonsora was derived from a combination of the Latin words tonsor meaning [...] "barber" [...] or [...] "hairdresser" [...] and oris meaning [...] "mouth", in reference to the ants' mouthparts bearing combs <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> Zigrasimecia is one of seven ant species described from Burmese amber and one of the five Burmese amber species placed in Sphecomyrminae or incertae sedis. The other sphecomyrmin species are: Haidomyrmex cerberus, Haidomyrmex scimitarus, Haidomyrmex zigrasi, and Gerontoformica orientalis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the {{development}} of high-power variable-frequency/variable-voltage (VVVF) drives, or [...] "traction inverters," [...] has allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> [...] The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better {{able to cope with}} overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her second}} year in high school, Parker met Roy Thornton. They {{dropped out of school}} and were married on September 25, 1926, six days before her 16th birthday. Their marriage, marked by his {{frequent}} absences <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> with the law, was short-lived. After January 1929, their paths never crossed again. However, they never divorced, and Bonnie was wearing Thornton's wedding ring when she died. Thornton was still in prison when he heard of her death. He commented, [...] "I'm glad they went out like they did. It's much better than being caught." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{traction}} motors and generator were DC machines. Following {{the development of}} high-capacity silicon rectifiers in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an alternator using a diode bridge to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the commutator <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> in the generator. [...] Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed {{of the possibility of}} a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a flashover, which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien's 1934 poem [...] "The Adventures of Tom Bombadil" [...] depicts Bombadil as a [...] "merry fellow" [...] {{living in}} a small valley close to the Withywindle river, where he wanders and explores nature at his leisure. Several of the valley's mysterious residents, {{including}} the River-spirit Goldberry (also known as the [...] "River-woman's daughter"), the malevolent tree-spirit Old Man Willow, the Badger-folk and a Barrow-wight, attempt to capture Bombadil for their own ends, but quail at the power of Tom's voice, which defeats their enchantments and commands them {{to return to their}} natural existence. At the end of the poem, Bombadil captures and marries Goldberry. Throughout the poem, Bombadil is unconcerned by the attempts to capture him <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> them off with the power in his words.|$|E
