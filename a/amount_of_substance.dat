5|$|Current definition: The mole is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> of {{a system}} that {{contains}} as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon-12.

5|$|The International System of Quantities (ISQ) is {{a system}} based on seven base quantities: length, mass, time, {{electric}} current, thermodynamic temperature, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> and luminous intensity. Other quantities such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units. The ISQ is defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 80000, and was finalised in 2009 {{with the publication of}} ISO 80000-1.|$|E

5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> {{consumed}} is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

25|$|Entropy is an {{extensive}} property. It has {{the dimension of}} energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (JK−1) in the International System of Units (or kgm2s−2K−1 in terms of base units).

25|$|The mole is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} that denotes an <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> (also called chemical amount).

The number of entities per mole is known as the Avogadro constant, and is determined empirically to be approximately 6.022 mol−1. Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in moldm−3.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{instrument}} analysis is to quantify an <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance.</b> This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some sample in the library. This is best performed by a computer {{because there are a}} myriad of visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also simultaneously correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by GC), to more accurately relate certain data.|$|E

50|$|Theoretical {{chemistry}} requires quantities from core physics, such as time, volume, temperature, and pressure.

25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the possible correlation between the degree of conversion (DC) and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> eluted from three commercial cured resin-based cements.

The obtained results, after multiple statistical evaluation (one way ANOVA, LSD post hoc test), showed {{no significant differences in}} the DC values between the resin cements. On the contrary, the results of the HPLC analysis depicted statistically significant differences between the three materials with respect to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> leached monomers.
