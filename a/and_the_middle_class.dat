5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all {{segments}} of society. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic. The wealthier landowners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E
25|$|An {{alliance}} between the most educated workers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> was borne of the new radical liberalism, better known as Republicanism because of its opposition to the alliance of former liberals who now depended on the monarchist state (the newly entitled bourgeois) and the conservative monarchists of the old aristocracy, as well as large capitalists, landowners and dependents of the royal court.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been claimed, however, that the Catholic–Protestant divide is intermingled with class issues.

25|$|However, {{starting}} with the summer of 1948, individuals or small groups went underground into the Carpathians, forming various groups of armed resistance in what was a relatively large movement, gathering several thousand people. The rebels came from all social strata and {{all areas of the}} country, spreading everywhere the terrain could shield them. The movement was related to the spate of mass arrests hitting the country after the communist power seizure on the eve of 1948, {{as well as to the}} political and economical measures which ruined a sizeable part of the peasantry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the drama}} was also {{enormously}} popular, from the Queen and Court {{down to the}} commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> generally more hostile {{with the growth of}} Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control in Shoreditch to the north, or the Bankside and Paris Garden in Southwark, on the southern bank of the River Thames: the Curtain, the Rose, the Swan, the Fortune, the Globe, the Blackfrairs a famous roster.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} would change only {{several years later}} with a new industrial boom fostered by CORFO {{and the expansion of}} the state apparatus from the late 1930s. At this time, the aristocracy lost much of its power <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> composed of merchants, bureaucrats and professionals, acquired the role of setting national policy. In this context, Santiago began to develop a substantial middle- and lower-class population, while the upper classes sought refuge in the districts of the capital. Thus, the old moneyed class trips to Cousino and Alameda Park, lost hegemony over popular entertainment venues such as the National Stadium emerged in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the living}} {{standard}} {{for people in}} Pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During her first and second term, the difference {{between rich and poor}} visibly increased <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the rich were statistically were improved and the poor declined in terms of living standards. Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal Bangladeshi immigration. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in Bangladesh–Pakistan relations, as Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to Pakistan. Religious parties also criticised Bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as anti-Islamic.|$|E
25|$|By now {{the rate}} of {{production}} of religious art was noticeably slowing down. After a spate of building and re-building in the Baroque period, Catholic countries were mostly clearly overstocked with churches, monasteries and convents, {{in the case of}} some places such as Naples, almost absurdly so. The Church was now less important as a patron than royalty and the aristocracy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> demand for art, mostly secular, was increasing rapidly. Artists could now have a successful career painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes or other genre specialisms, without ever painting a religious subject – something unusual hitherto unusual in the Catholic countries, though long the norm in Protestant ones. The number of sales of paintings, metalwork and other church fittings to private collectors increased during the century, especially in Italy, where the Grand Tour gave rise to networks of dealers and agents. Leonardo da Vinci's London Virgin of the Rocks was sold to the Scottish artist and dealer Gavin Hamilton by the church in Milan that it was painted for in about 1781; the version in the Louvre having apparently been diverted from the same church three centuries earlier by Leonardo himself, to go to the King of France.|$|E
