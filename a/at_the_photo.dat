While investigating the robbery, Scully is rendered unconscious and kidnapped by Schnauz. Mulder heads to the office where Schnauz's father used to work as a dentist, and finds the exam chair missing. Scully awakens bound to the chair with Schnauz claiming he's going to kill the howlers in her head. Schnauz takes a photo of himself, the result of which greatly disturb him, then prepares to lobotomize Scully. Mulder, having found a clue in a photo of Scully from the drugstore's photo booth, finds a trailer in a cemetery and realizes it belongs to Schnauz. He manages to break in and shoot Schnauz in the nick of time. Mulder looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> Schnauz took of himself, in which he is lying dead on the floor.|$|E

As a result of this, Jenna is named the [...] "Funniest Person in New York" [...] by Time Out magazine, and seeing how Liz feels about this, Jenna decides to share the magazine cover with her. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> shoot, the photographer (Clayton Dean Smith) wants Jenna to use props for the shoot, but Jenna is reluctant to use any of them. Liz, however, decides to pose with the props, resulting in her being {{on the cover of}} Time Out, much to Jenna's displeasure.|$|E

He visits an entomologist to {{look at one of the}} bees and is told that Mulder visited him six months ago about a similar subject. Skinner finds Mulder's file on the matter, copying down the contact information for Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees. Skinner visits the co-worker of the postal worker who died, who tells him she was pressured to not say anything about what happened by men who demanded a damaged package. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> lab Mulder analyzes the photo, which reveals Skinner's identity.|$|E

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E

[...] Käsebier admired their efforts, but desired to, in her own words, photograph a [...] "real raw Indian, the kind I used to see when I was a child", referring to her early years in Colorado and on the Great Plains. Käsebier selected one Indian, Chief Iron Tail, to approach for a photograph without regalia. He did not object.

Käsebier re-photographed him, this time in his full feather headdress, much to his satisfaction. Chief Iron Tail was an international celebrity.

He was leaning slightly forward, as if yielding beneath a burden of life, or to the pull of fate. He looked out musingly, and there was no hint of rebellion in the contours of the regular features. The hair was brushed back, soft and thick, straight from his fine brow. His nose was small and shapely, his chin rounded, cleft, rather beautifully moulded. Byrne gazed also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo.</b> His look became distressed and helpless.|$|E

As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.
