500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

This time Taylor, stretching a fraction {{to avoid having to}} use the rest, sunk the black ball on his fourth shot. As the audience erupted, one of snooker's greatest-ever comebacks was complete at 12.23 a.m. on <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> (29 April 1985).

2500|$|The {{decreased}} traffic {{caused the}} airport to reduce {{the plans for the}} size of the new terminal, cutting it to [...] and a cost of NOK10 million. NOK2 million was financed through an interest-free loan from the county. To save NOK600,000 in conjuncture tax, it was decided that the terminal would be built by the municipality, as it would then be regarded as a public, rather than private, investment. In late 2000 and early 2001, Widerøe put in a Dash 8-100 with two weekly services to cater week commuters from Eastern Norway. From February 2001, Widerøe terminated the service, but the extra service was partially replaced with <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> service to Oslo by Danish Air Transport, using an ATR 42. The new terminal was opened on 1 August 2001, having cost NOK7 million. By that year, the patronage had fallen to 20,000.|$|E

The song [...] "Strawberry Sadistic", which appeared on E.G. Pop, was originally a promotional track to the 2016 Japanese film High & Low: The Movie, which was co-produced by the management of E-girl's, LDH. Despite this, it made an appearance on the accompanying soundtrack and eventually was listed at number ten on E.G. Crazy. The two new tracks from the studio record: [...] "All Day Long Lady" [...] and [...] "Harajuku Time Bomb", were distributed on the Avex YouTube channel.

2500|$|Coverage {{was mostly}} negative. Richard Dorment wrote in The Daily Telegraph: [...] "The {{shortlist}} for this year's Turner Prize is so wilfully opaque it's irrelevant." [...] In his opinion the artists selected exemplified [...] "Euro-art, a term I've {{made up to}} describe {{a certain kind of}} technically competent, bland, and ultimately empty art made specifically for international biennales." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that the show [...] "reflect a mentality only too dominant in art magazines and curating right nowa rather overthought, overtalked, pseudo-intellectual culture." [...] In The Times, Rachel Campbell-Johnston wrote, [...] "I can't help thinking that this show will prove ... like the returns desk of Ikea on <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> Lots of frustrated people will be left staring at a pile of inscrutable junk." [...] In the Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager wrote, [...] "Don’t go. Don’t even think about going. This year’s Turner Prize exhibition is without competition the worst {{in the history of the}} award.... a killer mix of self-indulgence and academicism." [...] Laura Cumming in The Observer agreed, [...] "If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss then 2008 is the ideal year." [...] saying that [...] "t is not that the art is wilfully bad ... it is just that it is almost entirely inactive." [...] In contrast, Adrian Searle wrote in The Guardian: [...] "here's a depth and complexity [...] that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual chat about winners and losers." ...|$|E
