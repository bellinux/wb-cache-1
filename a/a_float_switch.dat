50|$|<b>A</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is {{a device}} {{used to detect}} the level of liquid within a tank. The switch {{may be used to}} control a pump, as an indicator, an alarm, or to control other devices.|$|E
5000|$|Low-water cutoff: It is a {{mechanical}} means (usually <b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch)</b> {{that is used}} to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point. If a boiler is [...] "dry-fired" [...] (burned without water in it) it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Float</b> <b>switches</b> {{are used}} to {{automatically}} turn the sump pump on when water rises to <b>a</b> preset level. <b>Float</b> <b>switches</b> must be clear of any obstructions within the sump. <b>A</b> <b>float</b> guard {{can be used to}} prevent the <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> from accidentally resting on the pump housing, and remaining on. <b>As</b> mechanical <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly.|$|R
50|$|A special {{application}} of float-type sensors is {{the determination of}} interface level in oil-water separation systems. Two floats {{can be used with}} each float sized to match the specific gravity of the oil on one hand, and the water on the other. Another special {{application of}} <b>a</b> stem type <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is the installation of temperature or pressure sensors to create a multi-parameter sensor. Magnetic <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> are popular for simplicity, dependability and low cost.|$|R
50|$|With magnetically {{actuated}} <b>float</b> sensors, <b>switching</b> {{occurs when}} a permanent magnet sealed inside <b>a</b> <b>float</b> rises or falls to the actuation level. With <b>a</b> mechanically actuated <b>float,</b> <b>switching</b> occurs as <b>a</b> result of the movement of <b>a</b> <b>float</b> against <b>a</b> miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect {{the selection of the}} stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Most Learjet 25 {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the wing boost pumps through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, <b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> de-energizes the wing boost pumps and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.|$|E
50|$|To ensure storm {{resistance}} {{in the event of}} water seeping into the pontoons, each pontoon is outfitted with a leak detection system with <b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> that sits about 3 inches off the floor. If the pontoon is breached, an alarm will sound inside the maintenance building. From there, a pump can be lowered into the chamber and controlled from the deck above.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the model, {{the relay}} has {{multiple}} methods {{to detect a}} failing transformer. On a slow accumulation of gas, due perhaps to slight overload, gas produced by decomposition of insulating oil accumulates {{in the top of}} the relay and forces the oil level down. <b>A</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> in the relay is used to initiate an alarm signal. Depending on design, a second float may also serve to detect slow oil leaks.|$|E

50|$|Condensate pumps usually run {{intermittently}} {{and have}} a tank in which condensate can accumulate. Eventually, the accumulating liquid raises <b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> energizing the pump. The pump then runs until the level of liquid in the tank is substantially lowered. Some pumps contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the HVAC equipment (preventing the production of further condensate), trigger an alarm, or both.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, {{the level of}} fuel carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications the fuel level is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the fuel level is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate fuel level of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by <b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (<b>a</b> <b>float</b> <b>switch),</b> the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a limit switch or microswitch), or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A limit switch is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem with}} {{high water level}} alarm that led to power {{shutdown}} did first occurred on the 3 rd of May 2008 at Ringhals 1. In the beginning there was a theory that boiling triggered the measurement system that consists of <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> <b>switch,</b> {{it has not been}} verified if the alarm was triggered by steam or liquid. During the investigation process data was collected from Vattenfalls’ information systems and a RELAP 5 model of the drainage system. This model was built with the purpose of simulating different scenario and to gather data that Vattenfall was lacking. It was first stated from Vattenfall that power shutdown was avoided on the 9 th of May due to opening a valve more gradually. Analyzes comparing the cases 3 rd of May and 9 th of May show that the conditions was not equal enough to make the conclusion. Model simulations show that both super heaters take half of the mass flow (assuming negligible differences) from the high pressure turbine under all circumstances, therefore the crossflow pipe takes the other half in cases on the 3 rd and 9 th of May 2008. A theory that one of the super heaters at 3 rd of May was overloaded is not the case according to the model. Liquid that was accumulated and dumped from pipe systems and then triggered the high level alarm was investigated. Results show that the pipe system after the drainage tank can acquire enough water if it is assumed that the water is pushed up into the tank from a back flow. The main goal should be to examine the measured data that occurs more than 3 hours before the high level alarm is triggered and caused a power shutdown at 3 rd of May. This {{due to the fact that}} no unusual data for the 9 th of May was observed. Validerat; 20130612 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

5000|$|Where level must be sensed {{inside a}} {{pressurized}} vessel, often a magnet {{is used to}} couple {{the motion of the}} <b>float</b> to <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> located outside the pressurized volume.

Successful <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> installations minimize the opportunity for accumulation of dirt on the float that would impede its motion. <b>Float</b> <b>switch</b> materials are selected to resists the deleterious effects of corrosive process liquids.

5000|$|Water level sensing switch type - Pressure {{switches}} {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. <b>Float</b> <b>switches,</b> particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|R

Kari-Finn Ky began to make itself the plastic parts it needed for the <b>float</b> <b>switches.</b> And as there was capacity left, it also began to produce plastic parts for other industrial companies in Lahti region. Kari-Finn Ky was divided into two companies in 1988: Kari-Finn Oy making <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> and its subsidiary company Muovisto Oy making plastic parts. In year 2008 a new parent company, KFR Hollola Oy, was founded. It started {{to take care of}} corporations lead services, management, financing actions and research and development services.

50|$|Liquid level <b>floats,</b> or <b>float</b> <b>switches,</b> use the {{principle}} of material buoyancy (differential densities) to follow fluid levels. Solid floats are often made of plastics with a density less than water or other application liquid, and so they float.

40|$|Abstract—high and {{low-side}} {{gate drivers}} are required in most switching power converters to provide on/off {{control of both}} ground referenced and <b>floating</b> <b>switches.</b> The drivers are required to provide sufficient current to the gates to meet timing requirements, provide <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> supply to the high-side device, and create a proper dead time between the switches to avoid simultaneous conduction. A method is proposed that uses two low-voltage integrated circuits (LVICs) to provide high and lowside gate drive in high-voltage applications. A coupling capacitor is placed between the two ICs to provide three functions: (1) high-voltage isolation, (2) high and low-side power supply, and (3) signaling to the high-side for on/off control. Integrated switches are used on each IC to provide active current steering for charge-pump power supply operation and current sensing for signaling detection. The required key blocks for IC fabrication are also discussed. A discrete test-bed is built to verify chargepump operation {{as well as the}} characteristic current flowing through the coupling capacitor for detection and sequencing through the operating modes.

30|$|A bypass or {{overflow}} pipe is usually necessary for an ordinary {{rainwater harvesting system}} so that continuing water flow is directed away from the full water tank to protect the area from erosion. No need for such an {{overflow pipe}} in our design as when the roof water tank has reached capacity (i.e. the tank <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is deactivated), any additional rainwater will be drained to the street (or to a ground/underground storage tank) through the overflow of the roof drain and the pump will be off. The water pump will start pumping {{if and only if}} the water level in the storage tank is lower than its maximum and the roof rainwater gauge (the drain <b>float</b> <b>switch)</b> is activated. The outlet pipe, installed above the bottom of the storage tank, is used to supply water to the distribution system that ultimately delivers the captured rainwater to its desired location, e.g. the apartments of the residential building in our case.

40|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{has started}} the {{development}} of a Pulse Width Modulator Application Specific Integrated Circuit (PWMA). This development is leveraging the previous development of the Switch Control ASIC (SCA). The purpose of the development is to provide the control for a selected range of power converter topologies and to meet the stringent environmental requirements of deep space missions. The PWMA will include several power control functions that are not normally included on the off-the-shelf components available today. One key functional requirement is the ability to implement an N + K redundant power converter with the ability to control the charging of a battery. Other applications will be the typical point of load isolated and non-isolated power converters. The purpose the development is not only to provide a much needed flight part, but also to accelerate the engineering process by using a standard cell library from previous ASIC developments. Under previous developments with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, JPL has produced three ASICs. Each ASIC has been implemented by using an analog standard cell library. One such development was the SCA, which is design to provide <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> power <b>switch</b> control. The functional verification of this ASIC has been completed and the cells used have been targeted for the new development of the PWMA. The primary function of the PWMA is to provide the control function of a point of load power converter. The design is an isolated 60 W converter with a 33 V output. In architecting the design, several functions were left up to the power converter design {{in order to make the}} ASIC more generic. The ASIC can be used for several power converter topologies and power levels. Some additional features have been added to the ASIC to provide the interfaces for multi-phase topologies and battery control functions. An N+K fault tolerant strategy has been implemented in order to provide the battery control functions. The PWMA has been developed to provide an ASIC with several functions not normally available in the off the shelf controllers. These functions have been added to enable the power converter designers to achieve fault tolerant designs and battery control functions...|$|R
