50|$|If either fetal or <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> serum is {{incorporated}} in the nutrient medium of cell cultures used to propagate PPV, it should be pretested for viral inhibitors. The same may apply to sera of several other species. Because replication of PPV is affected by mitotic activity, {{the effect of the}} serum on the cells is also especially important. In addition, cultures should be pretested for PPV contamination. Cultures are sometimes unknowingly prepared from infected tissues of fetal and postnatal pigs. Moreover, PPV can be accidentally introduced into cultures in several ways, including the use of contaminated trypsin. If contamination is detected before all cells are infected, the virus can be eliminated by repeatedly subculturing the cells in the presence of nutrient medium containing PPV antiserum.|$|E

40|$|Extracts of milk coagulating enzymes were obtained, <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> {{from the}} abomasums of pasture fed cattle and lamb rennet from the abomasums of {{partially}} milk fed lambs slaughtered {{between three and}} six months of age. Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions calf rennet was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets were compared with calf rennet. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than calf rennet at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf rennet when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf rennet. Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three rennets. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while calf rennet hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine,</b> lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine rennets were compared with cheese made with calf rennet and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride. The eluent was more active than the original rennet, was crystal clear in appearance and remained so during twelve months storage when normally mucoproteins would have precipitated out of solution to form a cloud in the rennet...|$|E

MethodsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage were radiolabeled with [14 C]lysine in medium including {{fetal bovine serum}} and ascorbate, and then maintained for chase periods up to 28 days. In some samples, β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) was included during chase to inhibit lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking. Tissue was hydrolyzed and analyzed for [14 C]metabolites in the forms of lysine, hydroxylysine, dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (ΔDHLNL), and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP). ResultsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage metabolized lysine into hydroxylysine and the collagen crosslinks, ΔDHLNL and HP. During chase, [14 C]hydroxylysine maintained steady-state levels, [14 C]DHLNL rose to a plateau, and [14 C]HP increased gradually. Addition of BAPN inhibited formation of [14 C]DHLNL. Analysis of raw data and that normalized to [14 C]hydroxylysine gave characteristic time constants for formation of ΔDHLNL and HP crosslinks of 1 – 2 and 7 – 30 days, respectively. The distribution of [14 C]lysine metabolites in collagen crosslinks was described by peak values in [14 C]DHLNL/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 047 – 0. 064 and in [14 C]HP/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 03.

Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41. 8 and 40. 6 % of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp- 2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria.

In human medicine, cardiomyopathies frequently warrant heart transplantation in children and <b>adults.</b> <b>Bovine</b> dilated cardiomyopathy (BDCMP) is a heart muscle disorder that has been observed during the last 30 years in cattle of Holstein-Friesian origin. In Switzerland BDCMP affects Swiss Fleckvieh and Red Holstein breeds. BDCMP {{is characterized by a}} cardiac enlargement with ventricular remodeling and chamber dilatation. The common symptoms in affected animals are subacute subcutaneous edema, congestion of the jugular veins, and tachycardia with gallop rhythm. A cardiomegaly with dilatation and hypertrophy of all heart chambers, myocardial degeneration, and fibrosis are typical postmortem findings. It was shown that all BDCMP cases reported worldwide traced back to a red factor-carrying Holstein-Friesian bull, ABC Reflection Sovereign. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was proposed for BDCMP. Recently, the disease locus was mapped to a 6. 7 -Mb interval MSBDCMP 06 -BMS 2785 on bovine Chr 18 (BTA 18).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In vitro {{mechanical}} injury of articular cartilage {{is useful to}} identify events associated with development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA). To date, many in vitro injury models have used animal cartilage despite the greater clinical relevance of human cartilage. We aimed to characterize a new in vitro injury model using elderly human femoral head cartilage and compare its behavior to that of an existing model with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral head cartilage. DESIGN: Mechanical properties of human and bovine cartilage disks were characterized by elastic modulus and hydraulic permeability in radially confined axial compression, and by Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and direction-dependent radial strain in unconfined compression. Biochemical composition was assessed in terms of tissue water, solid, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. Responses to {{mechanical injury}} were assessed by observation of macroscopic superficial tissue cracks and histological measurements of cell viability following single injurious ramp loads at 7 or 70 %/s strain rate to 3 or 14 MPa peak stress. RESULTS: Confined compression moduli and Young's moduli were greater in elderly human femoral cartilage vs <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage whereas hydraulic permeability was less. Radial deformations of axially compressed explant disks were more anisotropic (direction-dependent) for the human cartilage. In both cartilage sources, tissue cracking and associated cell death during injurious loading was common for 14 MPa peak stress at both strain rates. CONCLUSION: Despite differences in mechanical properties, acute damage induced by injurious loading was similar in both elderly human femoral cartilage and <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage, supporting the clinical relevance of animal-based cartilage injury models. However, inherent structural differences such as cell density may influence subsequent cell-mediated responses to injurious loading and affect the development of OA...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to visualize, at the ultrastructural level, the {{deformation}} and failure mechanism of cartilage matrix in the tensile mode. Full-thickness dumbbell-shaped specimens were prepared from <b>adult</b> <b>bovines.</b> There were two specimen groups; in the ‘parallel’ group the specimen axis was parallel to the split lines defining the preferential orientation of the collagen in the articular surface, and in the ‘perpendicular’ group the specimen axis was perpendicular to the split lines. Specimens were placed with the articular surface uppermost and subjected to a graded series of strain within individual mini-tension devices, while observed with stereomicroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Thereafter, the changes in the ultrastructure were observed with both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanism of cartilage failure in the tensile mode comprised the following stages, whether the strain was applied parallel or perpendicular to the split line. (1) At 0 % strain a fibrillar meshwork within the articular surface was predominantly orientated in the direction of the split line. (2) As strain increased, the fibrillar meshwork became more orientated in the parallel group and reorientated in the perpendicular group in the direction of the applied strain. (3) After complete reorientation of the fibrillar meshwork in the direction of the applied strain, the initial sign of failure was rupture of the fibrillar meshwork within the articular surface. (4) Subsequently, the rupture rapidly propagated into the deeper layers. Greater strains were required for fibrillar reorientation and complete rupture in the ‘perpendicular group’ than in the parallel group...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (HOPE), {{was used}} to determine the relative abundances of predominant Bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. For this analysis, genomic DNA in feces of healthy human <b>adults,</b> <b>bovines,</b> and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16 S rRNA genes were PCR amplified and used as the DNA templates for HOPE. Nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect 14 Bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex HOPE reaction mixtures. Results showed that species like B. vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. caccae, B. uniformis, B. fragilis, B. eggerthii, and B. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0. 1 % of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes. Minor species like B. pyogenes, B. salyersiae, and B. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the B. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to ∼ 0. 2 % of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes). Furthermore, Bac 303 -related targets (i. e., most Bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44 % of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two, respectively. These results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative PCR and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16 S rRNA clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that HOPE can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of Bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples...|$|R

Results from RIA and ELISAs indicate that anti-LC(1 - 30) and anti-CC(1 - 30) recognize different epitopes of this peptide and of TGF-beta 1 itself...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} {{organization and}} protein composition of lens fiber junctions isolated from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf lenses were studied using combined electron microscopy, immunolocalization with monoclonal and polyclonal anti-MIP and anti-MP 70 (two putative gap junction-forming proteins), and freezefracture and label-fracture methods. The major intrinsic protein of lens plasma membranes (MIP) was localized in single membranes {{and in an}} extensive network of junctions having flat and undulating surface topologies. In wavy junctions, polyclonal and monoclonal anti-MIPs labeled only the cytoplasmic surface of the convex membrane of the junction. Label-fracture experiments demonstrated that the convex membrane contained MIP arranged i...|$|E
40|$|Cu {{concentration}} of foetal organs {{are similar to}} those of the <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> with the exception of the liver and the spleen which are considerably greater. The liver Cu {{concentration of}} the foetus is independent of the age of the foetus within a range of 33 - 345 p. p. m. of Cu in the liver of dams. There is limited evidence to show that at lower dam levels, there is some correlation. Total foetal Cu is related to the age of the foetus, but appears also to be largely independent of liver Cu concentrations of the dam...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the study on the {{hemoglobin}} contained in newborn bovine blood, two major and five minor components which are specific to newborn bovine hemoglobin were detected by the methods of agar-gel electrophoresis, cellulose-acetate membrane electrophoresis and column chromatography. These components were examined on their alkaline resistance, and the results showed that all the components of newborn bovine hemoglobin were less resistant than those of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> hemoglobin, and that these components are different in their alkaline resistance one another. In addition, the quantitative changes of the components in newborn bovine hemoglobin accompanying the development after birth were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis has reemerged in China {{in regions}} {{where it was}} {{previously}} controlled. As reductions in schistosomiasis, a water-born parasitic infection, prompt consideration of schistosomiasis elimination, surveillance strategies that can signal reemergence and prevent further lapses in control are needed. We examined the distribution of Schistosoma japonicum, the species that causes schistosomiasis in China, in 53 villages. The villages were located in regions of Sichuan province where schistosomiasis reemergence had been documented by public health authorities. We tested three key reservoirs, humans, cows and water buffalo, and freshwater snails for S. japonicum infection {{in an effort to}} identify high-risk populations and evaluate their ability to signal reemergence. Human and bovine infections were common, detected in 35 villages and 23 villages, respectively, but infected snails were rare, found in only one village. Two commonly used surveillance methods, hospital reports of acute schistosomiasis and surveys for S. japonicum-infected snails, grossly underestimated the number of villages where human infections were present. Schistosomiasis was widespread in the region we studied, highlighting the danger reemergence poses to disease elimination programs. Surveillance systems that monitor high-risk populations such as older <b>adults</b> or <b>bovine</b> owners should be considered to promote detection of reemergence...|$|R
40|$|Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) {{and human}} T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) {{are closely related}} d-retroviruses that induce {{hematological}} diseases. HTLV- 1 infects about 15 million people worldwide, mainly in subtropical areas. HTLV- 1 induces {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases (e. g., HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis) and leukemia/lymphoma (<b>adult</b> T-cell leukemia). <b>Bovine</b> leukemia virus is a major pathogen of cattle, causing important economic losses due to a reduction in production, export limitations and lymphoma-associated death. In the absence of satisfactory treatment for these diseases and besides the prevention of transmission, the best option to reduce the prevalence of d-retroviruses is vaccination. Here, we provide an overview of the different vaccination strategies in the BLV model and outline key parameters required for vaccine efficacy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Human {{respiratory}} syncytial {{virus is}} an important cause of severe respiratory disease in young children, the elderly, and in immunocompromised <b>adults.</b> Similarly, <b>bovine</b> {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves {{as a model of}} respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection...|$|R
