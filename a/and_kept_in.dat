Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> {{the house where}} they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E

They were also bred in zoos in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s.|$|E

Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} {{in the history of}} the Isles, the realm endured periods of {{fragmentation}} between rival factions. Whether the references to Lǫgmaðr in the north are evidence of a similarly partitioned kingdom is unknown. The Norwegian subjugation of the Isles, and subsequent capture of Lǫgmaðr, are recounted by several sources. For instance, Orkneyinga saga states as much; whilst Morkinskinna further specifies that Lǫgmaðr fled southwards and out to sea, as Magnús' fleet advanced, only to be captured <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Norwegian king's company for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E

Dean {{was taken to}} a prison camp in Suwon where he was given food and medical treatment, but he began suffering from diarrhea and dysentery. Dean was then transported to the main North Korean prisoner of war camp in Seoul with other American prisoners. He attempted to keep his identity a secret but he was quickly recognized by a South Korean administrator who had worked under him before the war. Dean was moved to P'yongyang and given a larger living quarters in an underground North Korean facility. He remained sick owing to poorly prepared food.|$|E
5|$|Each block {{had access}} to courtyards, known as airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house incontinent patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings were made from stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the potential fire hazard. Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have been related to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state {{constitution}} specified that the President of the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E

From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug {{if he wanted to}} come to Hawaii with him.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{remained}} with the Australian Flying Corps until June 1919, {{as part of}} the British Occupation forces in Germany. After returning to Australia he worked as a turner in Melbourne. He married Muriel Cronan, a clerk who also played piano professionally, on 15 November 1919. They had met prior to the war <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch throughout Jones' overseas postings. The couple's first child, Ronald, arrived on 2 October 1920. A second son, Ian, would be born on 26 June 1934. Jones was described by family members as being a somewhat distant husband and father, dedicated to his career and rarely given to obvious displays of emotion.|$|E
5|$|Just before {{graduating from}} Millikin University in 1999, {{someone from the}} college {{recommended}} that West attend the GMA Music in the Rockies event for aspiring musicians.

West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating.
