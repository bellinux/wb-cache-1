40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out how XBRL will affect big <b>audit</b> <b>companies.</b> Purpose is to find out first of all, why <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> are involved in developing XBRL and secondly, what are the main outcomes of XBRL for these companies. Also, the value-added of XBRL for other information process participants from audit companies' perspective is discussed. The specific point of view of <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> in relation to XBRL is little researched in the past and thus, there is no ready-made theory to be tested. Instead, theoretical part presents previous research that suggests and helps to understand potential implications of XBRL for <b>audit</b> <b>companies.</b> In addition, theory about effective capital markets and information efficiency is utilized. The study is exploratory in nature as audit companies' point of view in relation to XBRL has not received much attention in the literature so far. Qualitative data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with professionals from <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> that represent different countries and knowledge areas. Interviewees' answers to the first research question, what are the underlying reasons for <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> to be involved in developing XBRL, revealed that <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> are involved in developing XBRL because of the reputational gains. They also need to understand XBRL well in order to be able to provide assurance on XBRL documents and consulting services for their clients. As XBRL is predicted to change financial reporting practices, it is perceived to be natural for <b>audit</b> <b>companies</b> to be involved in its development. To be involved in innovations was also considered important. Related to the second research question, to whom is XBRL mainly developed for and its value-added for information process participants, the interviewees saw that XBRL benefits mostly authorities and users of financial information such as analysts. Answering the third research question, what are the main outcomes of XBRL for <b>audit</b> <b>companies,</b> requires that four background factors are taken into account. First factor is whether reporting in XBRL is made mandatory or not in a given country. Without a mandate, XBRL is not likely to have great implications for any function. Second, for what purposes XBRL is used (for example filing financial statements, tax filings or supervisory reporting) determines which functions are affected by it. For example, banks use XBRL and they may need consulting and risk services offered by <b>audit</b> <b>companies.</b> Third, the history and structure of audit firms differ which means that same aspects of XBRL are dealt with in different functions. Lastly, the characteristics of the reporting firm have to be considered. If companies choose to implement XBRL deeper into their accounting systems, then they must have effective internal controls and it also enables more effective way to analyze information...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} what {{the impact is}} of frequently proposed information needs on reducing the audit expectations gap (AEG), including information about the <b>audited</b> <b>company,</b> information about the audit process and changes to the auditors' report. We base our findings on a survey of 302 participants from the Netherlands, consisting of 61 bankers, 118 preparers and 123 auditors. We consider the AEG in essence to be a classic agency problem. We find that stakeholders fall back in basic strategies to maximize their own value: bankers require additional information, management is reluctant to let the auditor provide sensitive information and auditors try to minimize their risks. Further, we observe that only information about the audit process with respect to continuity and the reporting of errors in the financial statements may reduce the bankers' AEG. Finally, we observe that format changes to the auditors' report do not reduce the bankers' AEG...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{nowadays}} economic instability, {{we might}} consider that financial auditors {{could have been}} one of the important triggers for the economic crisis. Companies that, shortly after undergoing financial audits and publishing their financial statements, seemed to display a viable and true and fair view of their performance in the financial statements – endorsed by financial auditors – faced economic tribulations and needed financial aid to be able to survive on the market, banks’ case included. Scholars believe that the banks and investment companies decisively contributed to the unfolding of the financial crisis. This study presents the important role played by the financial auditors in deploying the economic crisis, as well as solutions for re-instating the financial audit activity, as we outline a discrepancy between expectations and results. The role of financial auditors and of corporate governance should shape the economic re-launch by means of differentiated and finely-tuned approaches and be correlated, as well as proportional, with the dimension and characteristics of the <b>audited</b> <b>company...</b>|$|E
40|$|Existing actuarial {{literature}} {{provides guidance}} {{on the use}} of dollar and count-based methods for the estimation of ULAE liabilities. Traditional dollar-based methods are based on widely available, and usually <b>audited,</b> <b>company</b> financial data, while count-based methods rely on relatively detailed information regarding the number and cost of various claim-handling activities and events. In the case of fast reporting, slow paying lines of business, traditional dollar-based methods may not produce the best estimate of ULAE liabilities, since the familiar “ 50 / 50 ” assumption does not apply. On the other hand, the application of count-based methods is sometimes impractical. For example, the detailed claim count and activity cost data used in the structural methods can be quite difficult to compile and verify – especially to “outside” actuaries. This article describes a generalization to a familiar ULAE liability estimation approach, which attempts to duplicate some of the benefits of the structural methods, while relying exclusively on aggregate loss data. 9...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the House of Lords {{decision}} in Caparo Industries v Dickman there has been some apprehension within the auditing profession that there might be possible alternative liability under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and associated legislation. Baxt stated shortly after the case that in the absence of common law liability, section 52 ’might well be the way in which individual shareholders will seek to make the auditor liable’. Based on their wide operation in other areas the professional journals have suggested that section 52 and similar provisions of State Fair Trading Acts apply to create strict liability for even honest errors or omissions of auditors.
