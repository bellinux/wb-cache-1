5|$|Bolt {{turned his}} main {{focus to the}} 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships. This {{performance}} attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, <b>at</b> <b>sixteen</b> years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E

They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, but <b>at</b> <b>sixteen</b> {{was too young to}} enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145, but his grades were mediocre.|$|E

5|$|Ida Marcia Camelhor {{was born}} on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only {{surviving}} child {{of a family of}} eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She attended public grammar school and high school and, <b>at</b> <b>sixteen</b> years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career as a designer of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in the jewelry business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to {{the armored}} {{division}} organization, dramatically downsizing it. For {{all but the}} 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions, the number of armored battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older, larger organization. The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions, so {{by the end of}} 1943 there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required, and he suggested that six of the sixteen armored divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, and the number of armored divisions was frozen <b>at</b> <b>sixteen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Indeed, when {{financial}} circumstances forced Manning {{to leave}} school <b>at</b> <b>sixteen,</b> {{she worked as}} a typist, and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance {{lessons in}} Columbia and {{performed}} at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After {{graduating from high school}} <b>at</b> <b>sixteen,</b> Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The title role of Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role.|$|E

5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive <b>at</b> <b>sixteen</b> months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, playing with his elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on a backyard pitch on the family's dairy farm, owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school <b>at</b> <b>sixteen,</b> working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller. Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who {{died in a plane crash}} in Ireland.|$|E
