Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could {{demand that the}} line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. The concession was again considered on 2 November 1911, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that the concession would be removed if the line was not finished {{by the end of}} 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject to reports on the issue. The report suggested a different route, which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedgård. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien.|$|E
500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E

500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you could talk about a decision and he would accept it <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> in his game." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many stories {{exist to}} explain {{the origins of the}} footprints. The theatre's {{official}} account in its books and souvenir programs credit Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was [...] "pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it." [...] Still another account by the construction foreman, Jean Klossner, recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. The theatre's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity, after Talmadge, to be immortalized in the concrete.|$|E
