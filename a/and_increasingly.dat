5|$|Following World War II, in {{response}} to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, a great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> in cities. In mild-winter regions, {{it is usually}} a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the seventh {{generation}} {{was the beginning of}} direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|Following his release, Dostoyevsky read {{a myriad}} of {{literature}} and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Gambler and The Brothers Karamazov. With {{the help of his}} brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazinesVremya and Epochin which some of his stories appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued in the conservative The Russian Messenger until the introduction of A Writer's Diary, which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, remain unfinished.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> Irish-American, seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in a trickle of (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> blues records to the emerging market.|$|E
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland {{the last quarter of}} the 16th century and the first quarter of the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He {{developed}} dementia, {{and became}} completely blind <b>and</b> <b>increasingly</b> deaf. He {{was incapable of}} knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, {{and for the last}} few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of his}} fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
