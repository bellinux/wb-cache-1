5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he started}} the Tests slowly, failing to take a wicket in the first innings of the First Test at Brisbane before {{securing}} 3/43 in the second as the match was drawn. He removed Barrington, Pullar and David Sheppard. However he returned to form with 96 and 4/80 against South Australia, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> a milestone to his first-class career with a hat-trick against Western Australia in Perth. Having taken a wicket with the first ball of the innings, Davidson proceeded to bowl both Barry Shepherd and John Parker before Russell Waugh was caught by Norm O'Neill in the first innings. He ended with 5/40 and took 2/32 in the second innings as the visitors completed an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|During the 1966/67 season John {{was again}} chosen to trial for Wales. One {{of the trials}} forced him to miss the second Swansea {{encounter}} of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; {{his place in the}} Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett. Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John. In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team. This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11–4, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes. Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11–0 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to his tally with a dropped goal.|$|E

They added to their lead {{a few minutes later}} with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. Purdue scored their first points late in the first quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie a few minutes later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come any closer. Early in the third quarter, Michigan's Vincent Smith ran in a 19-yard touchdown, but the extra point failed. Purdue's only score of the second half was a 40-yard field goal that came in the third quarter. Michigan sealed their win late in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run by Stephen Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{team was}} able to score in the first quarter. Michigan had the best scoring opportunity, as they drove down into the Ohio State red zone before Denard Robinson fumbled the ball during a run. Ohio State opened the scoring {{early in the second}} quarter with a 33-yard field goal by Devin Barclay, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to their lead with a 7-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Dane Sanzenbacher. Michigan got their only points of the game a few minutes later with a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. Ohio State then proceeded to score 27 unanswered points and put the game out of reach. Immediately following the Michigan touchdown, Jordan Hall returned the kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Ohio State then added to their lead with a 33-yard reception by DeVier Posey. The Buckeyes had a chance to extend their lead {{at the end of the}} first half, but a Terrelle Pryor pass was intercepted by Jordan Kovacs in the Michigan endzone. In the third quarter, Dan Herron added a 32-yard run, and Barclay added two more field goals from 36 and 23 yards. These were the final points of the game, as neither team {{was able to}} score in the final quarter.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's triple figure average {{from his}} first two Test seasons could not be {{maintained}} when Australia hosted the 1950–51 Ashes series. Following his success in South Africa, Harvey played regularly at either the No. 3 or No. 4 from that point onwards. He managed 362 runs at 40.22 with three half centuries as Australia took the series 4–1. Harvey had trouble with Alec Bedser's in-swingers {{in the early part}} of the series and Bedser was the only Englishman to dismiss Harvey in the first three Tests. On the first day of the series, Harvey top-scored with 74 out of Australia's 228. It turned out to be crucial as rain created a sticky wicket; England made 7/68 and Australia 7/32, both declared. Australia went on to win by 70 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was also low scoring; Harvey made 42 and 31 as Australia won after neither team passed 200. He performed steadily through the series, with 39, 43 and 68 in the next two Tests, which were both won. He then made one and 52 in the Fifth Test defeat; it was the first in his 14 Tests and Australia's first since World War II and came on his home ground in Melbourne. Outside the Tests, Harvey scored 141 in a win over South Australia <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> 146 in the second innings of a match against New South Wales to stave off defeat. He ended the season with 1099 runs at 45.79.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic model}} assumes the {{observed}} HDR is the predicted HDR scaled by the weights for each event <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added,</b> with noise mixed in. This generates {{a set of}} linear equations with more equations than unknowns. A linear equation has an exact solution, under most conditions, when equations and unknowns match. Hence one could choose any subset of the equations, with the number equal {{to the number of}} variables, and solve them. But, when these solutions are plugged into the left-out equations, there will be a mismatch between the right and left sides, the error. The GLM model attempts to find the scaling weights that minimize the sum of the squares of the error. This method is provably optimal if the error were distributed as a bell curve, and if the scaling-and-summing model were accurate. For a more mathematical description of the GLM model, see generalized linear models.|$|E
25|$|CaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern {{art gallery}} in {{the centre of}} Madrid. It is {{sponsored}} by the Catalan-Balearic bank La Caixa and located next to the Salón del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most-visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, who took an unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> additional floors encased with rusted steel.

25|$|Porter {{has pointed}} out that Massey and Kuhn's analogies include a number of errors, e.g. Massey stated that December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was {{selected}} based on the birth of Horus, but the New Testament does not include any reference to the date or season of the birth of Jesus. The earliest known source recognizing the 25th of December as the date of birth of Jesus is by Hippolytus of Rome, written around the beginning of the 3rd century, {{based on the assumption that}} the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox. Hippolytus placed the equinox on March 25 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> 9 months to get December 25, thus establishing the date for festivals.

25|$|The {{earliest}} source stating December 25 as {{the date}} of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170–236), written {{very early in the}} 3rd century, {{based on the assumption that}} the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> nine months. There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and Baptism of Jesus on the same day, on January 6 while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the Winter solstice); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts. The earliest suggestions of a fast of Baptism of Jesus on January 6 during the 2nd century comes from Clement of Alexandria, but there is no further mention of such a feast until 361 when Emperor Julian attended a feast on January 6 in the year 361.|$|E
25|$|For {{the audio}} and sound {{engineering}} on the tour, DiGiCo SD7 consoles {{were used by}} mixing specialists Andy Meyer and monitor engineers Matt Napier and Sean Spuehler. Since Madonna wanted to have an authentic feel with the live sound, Spuehler mixed her vocal effects <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> it to the house consoles. During {{the duration of the}} concert, the singer ventures {{into the middle of the}} crowd as the runway approaches, resulting in the spill of the microphone in her hand constantly changing. The sound crew employed timecode to achieve this, whereby like the lighting and the choreography, the sound feed also changed depending on where the singer was onstage. All the musicians accompanying Madonna wore in-ear monitor, with additional monitoring for musical director/keyboardist Kevin Antunes, a thumper for drummer Brian Frasier-Moore and sidefills for the dancers. All the inputs from the different personnel including Madonna were fed into the SD7 console. A Multichannel Audio Digital Interface(MADI) was used to record all the shows to a digital audio workstation in RAID drives. They were archived into four terabyte backup disks.|$|E
25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>added</b> a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact.|$|E
