500|$|Frogs {{range in}} size from the {{recently}} discovered [...] Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea to the [...] goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of Cameroon. The skin hangs loosely on the body {{because of the lack of}} loose connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head. The <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.|$|E

50|$|One of London Zoo's most {{well-known}} buildings, the Reptile House opened in 1927 and {{was designed by}} Joan Beauchamp Procter and Sir Edward Guy Dawber. It houses several species of reptile, including Jamaican boa, Philippine crocodiles, eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, black mambas, rhinoceros iguanas, king cobras, emerald tree boas and Yemen chameleons. In December 2012, a refurbished amphibian section was opened to the public, displaying amphibians such as <b>African</b> <b>bullfrogs,</b> axolotls, caecillians and various types of poison dart frog.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> is {{carnivorous}} and a voracious eater, eating insects, small rodents, reptiles, small birds, {{and other}} amphibians. It {{is also a}} cannibalistic species — the male <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> is known for occasionally eating the tadpoles he guards. [...] An <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> kept at the Pretoria Zoo in South Africa once ate 17 Juvenile Rinkhals Snakes (Hemachatus haemachatus). They emit a loud croaking and a bleating sound when stressed or handled. Like the Pacman frogs and the Budgett's Frogs, African Bullfrogs also bite when they are provoked. It {{is one of three}} frog species that have sharp teeth and bite humans when they are provoked or handled by humans (when they are getting picked up by humans using their hands to lift them up).|$|E

40|$|Twenty-one small Gram-negative motile coccobacilli were {{isolated}} from 15 systemically diseased <b>African</b> <b>bullfrogs</b> (Pyxicephalus edulis), and were initially identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi by standard microbiological identification systems. Phylogenetic reconstructions using combined molecular analyses and comparative whole genome {{analysis of the}} most diverse of the bullfrog strains verified affiliation with the genus Brucella and placed the isolates in a cluster containing B. inopinata and the other non-classical Brucella species but also revealed significant genetic differences within the group. Four representative but molecularly and phenotypically diverse strains were used for in vitro and in vivo infection experiments. All readily multiplied in macrophage-like murine J 774 -cells, and their overall intramacrophagic growth rate was {{comparable to that of}} B. inopinata BO 1 and slightly higher than that of B. microti CCM 4915. In the BALB/c murine model of infection these strains replicated in both spleen and liver, but were less efficient than B. suis 1330. Some strains survived in the mammalian host for up to 12 weeks. The heterogeneity of these novel strains hampers a single species description but their phenotypic and genetic features suggest that they represent an evolutionary link between a soil-associated ancestor and the mammalian host-adapted pathogenic Brucella species...|$|R
40|$|Four host-defense {{peptides}} {{belonging to}} the tigerinin family (tigerinin- 1 O: RICTPIPFPMCY; tigerinin- 2 O: RTCIPIPLVMC; tigerinin- 3 O: RICTAIPLPMCL; and tigerinin- 4 O: RTCIPIPPVCF) were isolated from skin secretions of the <b>African</b> crowned <b>bullfrog</b> Hoplobatrachus occipitalis. In aqueous solution at pH 4. 8, the cyclic domain of tigerinin- 2 O adopts a rigid amphipathic conformation that incorporates a flexible N-terminal tail. The tigerinins lacked antimicrobial (MIC > 100 μM) and hemolytic (LC 50 > 500 μM) activities but, at a concentration of 20 μg/mL, significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by peritoneal cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice without affecting production of IL- 10 and IL- 17. Tigerinin- 2 O and - 4 O inhibited IFN-γ production at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL. The tigerinins significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) stimulated the rate of insulin release from BRIN-BD 11 clonal β-cells without compromising {{the integrity of the}} plasma membrane. Tigerinin- 1 O was the most potent (threshold concentration 1 nM) and the most effective (395 % increase over basal rate at a concentration of 1 μM). Tigerinin- 4 O was the most potent and effective peptide in stimulating the rate of glucagon-like peptide- 1 release from GLUTag enteroendocrine cells (threshold concentration 10 nM; 289 % increase over basal rate at 1 μM). Tigerinin peptides have potential for development into agents for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes...|$|R

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> males {{call out}} during the rainy season. The call lasts about a second and can be {{described}} as a deep low-pitched whoop. Males have two breeding strategies, depending on their age. Young males congregate in a small area, perhaps only 1 or 2 square meters of shallow water. The larger males occupy the center of these breeding arenas or leks and attempt to chase off other males. Often they fight, causing injury and even killing one another. The dominant male attempts to prevent other males from breeding. A female approaches the group of males by swimming along at the surface until she is within a few meters of the group. Then the female dives to avoid the smaller males and surfaces in the defended area of a larger male {{in the middle of the}} group. This helps to ensure that she mates with the dominant male.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{member of}} the largest order of {{amphibians}} is the African Goliath frog (Conraua goliath). The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8 kg and a snout-to-vent length of 39 cm. The largest of the toads, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), is also the second largest {{member of the}} frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65 kg and measure a maximum of 33 cm from snout-to-vent. Rivaling the previous two species, the <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Pyxicephalus adspersus) can range up to a weight of 2 kg and 25.5 cm from snout to vent. Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8 kg and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20 cm. However, the toad Beelzebufo ampinga, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era {{in what is now}} Madagascar, could grow to be 41 cm long and weigh up to 4.5 kg, making it the largest frog ever known. The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g. The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), which can reach 20 cm in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48 kg. While not quite as large as Ceratophrys cornuta, Leptodactylus pentadactylus is often heavier; it can reach 18.5 cm long and weigh 0.60 kg. The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), which can attain a length of 6 cm and nearly 28.3 g. Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the Mesobatrachia suborder, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known Brachytarsophrys or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17 cm and a maximum weight of 0.54 kg.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effect of varying storage period on the efficacy of frog pituitary {{with the aim of}} determining the optimum period required for effectively enhancing induction ovulalation, maturation and artificial propagation of Clarias gariepinus. Acetones dried pituitary extract obtained from non piscine source, the <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana adspersa, were stored over a period of 16 weeks and used to induce spawning in the female Clarias gariepinus). Fresh pituitary extract was used as control having being previously worked upon and confirmed to be effective. There were significant differences in percentage fertilization of the eggs with the fresh hormone giving the highest yield and the hormone stored for 3 and 4 months giving least. The hormone stored for 4 weeks gave relatively high percentage fertilization and can therefore be used as optimum storage period...|$|E

The results of this study indicated that stored R. adspersa pituitary hormone extract stored for 4 weeks gave the best result. Its yield was significantly different from that gotten using hormones stored for over 8 to 16 weeks period. It showed that the frog pituitary extract is still potent, viable and effective when stored for not more than 4 weeks.

40|$|The {{breeding}} of frogs in four ponds near Harare, Zimbabwe, was investigated during a wet rainy season (2000 / 01) and a dry one (2001 / 02). During 2000 / 01 eight and nine species bred in two ponds in abandoned gravel pits that never contained fish, but only four species bred in these in 2001 / 02 {{and the relative}} abundance was reduced by about 50 %. Pond 3 was a small dam that filled after the rains and was invaded by fish once it overflowed. Five species bred in it in 2000 / 01, but breeding activity was curtailed once it was invaded by catfish, Clarias gariepinus, {{some of which were}} found with frog remains in their stomachs. The pond did not overflow in the following season, and was therefore not invaded by fish; although only four species bred in it their relative abundance was considerably higher. Pond 4 was a permanent pond that always contained fish. Only three species bred in it and the relative abundance of tadpoles was always low. Species belonging to the Ranidae seemed to be most severely affected by drought and this may explain the absence of some species, such as the <b>African</b> <b>bullfrog,</b> Pyxicephalus adspersus, that was once abundant around Harare. </strong...|$|E
