So far below that no sound of its strife could reach us, the Yellowstone River ran--a finger-wide strip of jade-green. The sunlight took those wondrous walls and gave fresh hues to those that nature had already laid there. Once I saw the dawn break over a lake in Rajputana and the sun set over the Oodey Sagar amid a circle of Holman Hunt hills. This time I was watching both performances going on below me--upside down you understand--and the colours were real! The cañon was burning like Troy town; but it would burn for ever, and, thank goodness, neither pen nor brush could ever portray its splendours adequately. The Academy would reject the picture for a chromolithograph. The public would scoff at the letter-press for Daily Telegraphese. [...] "I will leave this thing alone," [...] said I; [...] "'tis my peculiar property. Nobody else shall share it with me." [...] Evening crept through the pines that shadowed us, but the full glory of the day flamed in that cañon as we went out very cautiously to a jutting piece of rock--blood-red or pink it was--that overhung the deepest deeps of all. Now I know what it is to sit enthroned amid the clouds of sunset. Giddiness took away all sensation of touch or form; but the sense of blinding colour remained. When I reached the mainland again I had sworn that I had been floating. The maid from New Hampshire said no word for a very long time. She then quoted poetry, which was perhaps the best thing she could have done.|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin GwinnerUnder the {{leadership}} of the Van Eekeren family, Land O’ Frost {{has become one of the}} fastest growing meat processing manufacturers in the United States. “Premium” is Land O’ Frost’s flagship brand which makes up 57 % of the company’s total sales dollars. Of the line of Premium lunchmeats, Honey Smoked Turkey is ranked # 3 in total sales dollars. However, if you rank the product’s performance by dividing its all commodity volume (ACV) by the number of pounds sold, it is ranked # 7 out of the nine single pack flavors offered in retail. There has been internal speculation that the Honey Smoked Turkey’s sales performance is related to a lack of honey/sweetness flavor in the lunchmeat. As a result, Land O’ Frost needed to determine if the current level of honey/sweetness flavor of the Honey Smoked Turkey needs to be increased in order to stimulate higher growth in sales. A third party consultant conducted a consumer test between Land O’ Frost’s honey smoked turkey and their top two competitors’ honey smoked turkey. Based on the results, the Land O’ Frost product was the least likely preferred and was rated as having the lowest sweetness flavor profile among the three products. In an effort to develop a sweeter tasting honey turkey, different test formulations were developed using different honeys, levels of honey and sweeteners. The lighter the honey grade the less flavor impact was present in the turkey. As a result, a test formula containing twice the amount of light <b>amber</b> <b>honey</b> and the maximum amount of sugar was developed to be sweeter and to offer better marketing claims to potentially attract more customers. Due to product process differences between the Land O’ Frost’s honey smoked turkey and its competitor’s, the decision was made to conduct another consumer test between the current control and the newly formulated test product. The data determined that there was not a significant difference between the two products tested. A triangle test was conducted via a third party and it also confirmed the same conclusion. With the test formula having a slightly higher cost per pound than the current control formula, it was decided internally that the test formula could replace the current formula if the test formula price per pound can be adjusted to the same cost as the control. I would recommend that the level of sugar in the new test formula be slightly decreased until the formula cost per pound is the same as the control. The cost of meat raw materials used by Land O’ Frost often changes due to market price conditions. The new formulated honey smoked turkey’s selling potential would still have a positive impact by utilizing claims such as “double the honey” and “lower sodium” on the package. In this case, the selling potential increase would be more heavily executed from a marketing perspective than from flavor development...|$|E
40|$|Raising market {{awareness}} CUE: Every {{year the}} world?s industries spend {{billions of dollars}} advertising their products: {{it is one of}} their most important marketing strategies. But what about small-scale farmers? Is advertising a strategy that they can use? One problem is that putting advertisements in newspapers or on the radio is usually quite expensive. However, for farmers who can group themselves and combine their resources, developing a strategy to raise awareness about their product may be a possibility. Our next report comes from The Gambia, where the National Beekeepers Association has found a number of ways of promoting their honey products. Through their work, consumers are now aware that honey comes in many different varieties with different tastes, and can even be good for their health! Ismaila Senghore spoke to the General Manager, Mr Abba Manneh, about how the association has increased the demand for honey in The Gambia. IN:		?When we established we ? OUT:		? and the malaina honey. DUR?N	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Abba Manneh describing the growing market for honey in The Gambia. Transcript Manneh	When we established we thought we should now try to sensitise people, so that we can increase demand. Because if we have more consumers locally, it means then the demand for the product will be also increased. Now we produced some information sheets informing them of the different sicknesses and diseases that honey can really cure. And the way they should go about taking honey to solve those problems Senghore	Do you locate specific places and specific markets that are advantageous to you and particular to you? Manneh	Yes! We started introducing the product also to the supermarkets and to the hotels, by way of getting some standard jars. And we also use labels. We label them, where we put our logo, and we put ?Natural Pure Gambian Honey, and underneath we put ?Organic?. Then our address, telephone, fax and so on, so that anybody who wants to contact us, can contact us at any time. We have started sensitising also the bakeries, so that they can also be using honey to coat their bread. Because {{it can be used to}} preserve bread for a longer period. Senghore	Now that is about your retailers and other clients, maybe wholesalers. Now what about the consumers? What do you focus on to make sure that the consumers are attracted to your product? Manneh	The consumers, we do make some sensitisation through the media, using ?The Observer? the radio and so on. And we also have a honey bench outside here which we display all the products, and anybody who comes to buy we try to sensitise. Senghore	Do they taste you honey to make sure that it is the one they like? Manneh	Yes! Now you see because Gambians were not aware of the different type of honeys that can be produced. But because of our existence, a lot of people now start to realise that honey has different colours, and why the different colours, is because they are coming from a different botanical source, and automatically they must have different taste. They will tell you either I would like mangrove honey - ?Do you have mangrove honey?? or ?Do you have cashew honey?? or ?Do you have malaina honey?? or ?Do you have mahogany honey?? So it is not the colour that they ask for. It is only the Europeans who ask for a colour. They will go and say ?No, I want amber? or ?I want light amber? or ?I want dark honey?. Senghore	Which are the types that are most popular? Manneh	Well here the most popular types are the light honey and the <b>amber</b> <b>honey.</b> That is the colour. But for the Gambians what they normally ask for is mangrove honey and the malaina honey. End of track. The National Beekeepers? Association in The Gambia uses a variety of methods to promote its honey products. These include information sheets, advertisements in newspapers and on the radio, and an outdoor display table where customers can come to try different honey types...|$|E

5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 15th Century, Ostrołęka grew into an important economic center in the Duchy of Masovia for trade with the neighboring Teutonic Order. Wood, <b>amber,</b> and <b>honey</b> were the most commonly traded items. In 1526, the Duchy was incorporated into the Polish Kingdom. This resulted in an economic boom, most commonly associated to today as Ostrołęka's Golden Age. At this time, Queen Bona Sforza founded a folwark in Pomian - a neighboring settlement at the time, which currently finds itself situated well within the modern city's borders. The Golden Age lasted for approximately 40 years, whose conclusion is marked by three major catastrophes which struck in 1564 and 1571. In 1564, an epidemic seriously depopulated the town and surrounding regions. The same year, a fire tore through the town burning most of it down to the ground. In 1571, before the town had time to recuperate from the two previous catastrophes, another epidemic struck, further depopulating the region, officially marking the end of the town's Golden Age. Within 20 years, however, the town was rebuilt, including with the construction of Ostrołęka's first school. By the late 1590s, the town became the center of a big administrative district, approximately 1,980.5 km2 in size.|$|R
5000|$|Some modern {{critics have}} argued that the [...] "Pirenne Thesis" [...] erred on two counts: by {{treating}} the Carolingian realm as a Roman state and by overemphasizing the effect of the Islamic conquests on the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Other critics {{have argued that}} while Pirenne was correct in arguing for the continuity of the Empire beyond the sack of Rome, the Arab conquests in the 7th century may not have disrupted Mediterranean trade routes to the degree that Pirenne argued. Michael McCormick in particular has argued that some recently unearthed sources, such as collective biographies, describe new trade routes. Moreover, other records and coins document the movement of Islamic currency into the Carolingian Empire. McCormick has concluded that if money was coming in, some type of goods must have been going out - including slaves, timber, weapons, <b>honey,</b> <b>amber,</b> and furs.|$|R
40|$|Colour and floral origin are key {{parameters}} {{that may}} influence the honey market. Monofloral light honey are more demanded by consumers, mainly due to their flavour, being more valuable for producers due to their higher price when compared to darker honey. The latter usually have a high anti-oxidant content that increases their healthy potential. This work showed {{that it is possible}} to correctly classify monofloral honey with a high variability in floral origin with a potentiometric electronic tongue after making a preliminary selection of honey according their colours: white, <b>amber</b> and dark <b>honey.</b> The results showed that the device had a very satisfactory sensitivity towards floral origin (Castanea sp., Echium sp., Erica sp., Lavandula sp., Prunus sp. and Rubus sp.), allowing a leave-one-out cross validation correct classification of 100 %.

40|$|Pot honey is {{the most}} {{abundant}} honey in the forest, produced by many species of stingless bees (Meliponini) of the Huottuja (Piaroa) community in Paria Grande, Venezuela. However, the commercialization of this honey is low, and false honeys, which are sold in labelled bottles, are easily found in the market. This study has investigated the ability of an untrained panel of Piaroa assessors to differentiate the genuine from the false pot honey using the Free-choice profile. This sensory method allows consumers {{to use their own}} words to describe and to quantify sensory attributes of a product. The genuine <b>honeys,</b> light <b>amber</b> Melipona fuscopilosa "isabitto" and dark amber Tetragona clavipes "ajavitte", the false light and dark "angelita" <b>honeys,</b> and the <b>amber</b> Apis mellifera <b>honey,</b> were evaluated. Sensory attributes related to the appearance, color, odor, flavor and mouthfeel were elicited in a qualitative session and were quantified in 10 -cm unstructured line scales using individual score sheets. The data were analyzed by Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA). The bidimensional plot successfully separated genuine from false pot honeys. The first dimension (39. 50 %) was represented by the low viscosity, fermented odor and sour taste, whereas the second dimension (24. 69 %) was related to fruity and honey odor and flavor. Huottuja assessors differentiated the five honey types in terms of the perceived sensory characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Pastaza is {{the largest}} and least {{populated}} province in Ecuador, with seven native indigenous nationalities. The Kichwas from the Rio Chico community live near to the capital city Puyo, are recognized for their knowledge on stingless honey bees. From the 400 species of Neotropical Meliponini that make honey in cerumen pots, almost 100 thrive in Southern Ecuador, and confer such biodiversity to pot-honey. In this study sensory characteristics of Ecuadorian false and genuine honeys with diverse entomological origin: Apis mellifera – light amber and amber, Geotrigona leucogastra, Melipona grandis and Scaptotrigona sp. (S. ederi np Schwarz) were investigated with Kichwa assessors (four female and four male, aged 18 – 62 years old). The panel was asked to taste and to identify sensory attributes of honey (appearance, taste, smell, aroma, mouthfeel, other tactile sensations), and to score their intensities in 10 cm unstructured line scales anchored with the words weak and strong, using the Free-Choice Profile methodology The Generalized Procrustes Analysis was used on the data. The first and second dimensions accounted for by 61. 1 % of the variance. In the descriptive sensory evaluation, darker <b>honeys</b> (<b>amber</b> A. mellifera, false and Geotrigona) were separated from (light amber A. mellifera, Melipona and Scaptotrigona) by the first dimension; whereas thicker honeys (A. mellifera and false) were discriminated from thinner honeys (Geotrigona, Melipona and Scaptotrigona) by the second dimension. The assessors were able to evaluate and differentiate honey types without previous sensory training. Remarkably, two Kichwa ladies immediately spit out the false honey, in contrast to an acceptance study on 18 -honeys, where the false honey was scored among the preferred ones by 58 participants of the First Congress on Apiculture and Meliponiculture in Ecuador. Therefore, results suggest that Ecuadorian native Kichwas keep a sensory legacy of ancestral knowledge with forest products such as honey...|$|R
