5|$|As of {{the late}} 2000s, The Washington Post wrote that the museum {{struggled}} with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, the museum {{remains one of the}} smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and {{less than one percent of}} the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This is due, in part, to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, the museum had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought private funding and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which the museum was expected to pay about $2.1 million. In late 2016, the museum held its first annual <b>African</b> <b>Arts</b> Awards Dinner for over 500 guests.|$|E

25|$|The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 {{objects from}} the {{greatest}} permanent collection of <b>African</b> <b>arts</b> and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir Henry Wellcome, which was donated by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at megalithic circles in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite Afro-Portuguese ivories, a series of soapstone figures from the Kissi people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the Bowdich collection, the rare Akan Drum from the same region in west Africa, the Benin and Igbo-Ukwu bronze sculptures, the beautiful Bronze Head of Queen Idia, a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from Ife, a similar terracotta head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the Apapa Hoard from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an Ikom monolith from Cross River State, the Torday collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the Kuba Kingdom including three royal figures, the unique Luzira Head from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from Gondar and Magdala, Ethiopia following the British Expedition to Abyssinia, excavated objects from Great Zimbabwe (that includes a unique soapstone, anthropomorphic figure) and satellite towns such as Mutare including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the Venda peoples and cave paintings and petroglyphs from South Africa.|$|E

500|$|Poulenc {{made his}} début as a {{composer}} in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it {{was dedicated to}} Satie and premiered at {{one of a series}} of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for <b>African</b> <b>arts</b> in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call [...] "leg-Poulenc". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} lines, Kuti {{comments}} on his social reality: [...] "When we talk say confusion / Everything out of control". His lyrics decry what he {{viewed as the}} colonial mindset of some Africans and employ pidgin English, which was the lingua franca of most people in English-speaking West Africa; he sings the phrase [...] "pafuka", which means [...] "all over" [...] or [...] "finished", and the interjection [...] "o" [...] to add emphasis. Kuti makes reference to three dialects and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult: [...] "Dem be three men wey sell for roadside-o / Dem three speak different language-o / Dem speak Lagos, Accra, and Conakry / One white man come pay them money-o / He pay them for pounds, dollars and French money-o / For the thing wey he go buy from them / He remain for them to share am-o / Me I say, na confusion be that-o / He go say he pafuka o." [...] <b>African</b> <b>Arts</b> journalist E.J. Collins interpreted the latter verse as {{a reference to the}} protracted nature of transactions in Lagos.|$|E
