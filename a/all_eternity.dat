5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend <b>all</b> <b>eternity</b> together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} monks extol {{the power of}} the Church. Bertram has freed Robert from the guards and the two arrive to prevent the {{marriage}} of Isabelle to the Prince of Granada. Bertram attempts to get Robert to sign a document in which he promises to serve Bertram for <b>all</b> <b>eternity.</b> He reveals to Robert that he is his true father and Robert decides to sign the oath from filial devotion. Before he can do so, Alice appears with the news that the Prince has been prevented from marrying Isabelle. Alice prays for divine help (Dieu puissant, ciel propice) and hands Robert his mother's will. Robert reads his mother's message, in which she warns him to beware the man who seduced and ruined her. Robert is wracked by indecision. Midnight strikes and the time for Bertram's coup is past. He is drawn down to hell. Robert is reunited with Isabelle in the cathedral, to great rejoicing.|$|E

60|$|Why {{should not}} he? It might be dangerous; yet, {{successful}} or unsuccessful, {{it must be}} glorious. The course of Christianity wanted great examples. Might he not-and his young heart beat high at the thought--might he not, by some great act of daring, self-sacrifice, divine madness of faith, like David's of old, when he went out against the giant--awaken selfish and luxurious souls to a noble emulation, and recall to their minds, perhaps to their lives, the patterns of those martyrs who were the pride, the glory, the heirloom of Egypt? And as figure after figure rose before his imagination, of simple men and weak women who had conquered temptation and shame, torture and death, to live for ever on the lips of men, and take their seats among the patricians of the heavenly court, with brows glittering through <b>all</b> <b>eternities</b> with the martyr's crown, his heart beat thick and fast, and he longed only {{for an opportunity to}} dare and die.|$|R

25|$|Critics {{regard the}} eternal {{punishment}} {{of those who}} fail to adopt Christian faith as morally objectionable, and consider it an abhorrent picture {{of the nature of}} the world. On a similar theme objections are made against the perceived injustice of punishing a person for <b>all</b> <b>eternity</b> for a temporal crime. Some Christians agree (see Annihilationism and Trinitarian Universalism). These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds objectionable.|$|E

Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named Nephele, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it and from their union came Centaurus. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for <b>all</b> <b>eternity,</b> at first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to Tartarus.|$|E

So let the rest be needed for a long time or a short time, let all these things have their moment when they are lacking or possessed, their moment is a subject of discussion until in death they are eternally forgotten-God’s kingdom is still that which is to be sought first but which ultimately will also last through <b>all</b> <b>eternities,</b> and “if that which will be abolished was glorious, that which remains will be more glorious,” and if it was hard to live in want, then it must indeed be only an easier separation to die to want! ...|$|R

Thousands of years ago, Arachne was a skilled weaver who became conceited and boasted that she was greater than the goddess Athena, who challenged Arachne to a weaving contest.

25|$|In the beginning, {{the great}} God Zurvan existed alone. Desiring {{offspring}} {{that would create}} “heaven and hell and everything in between”, Zurvan sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards {{the end of this}} period, androgyne Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan’s decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for <b>all</b> <b>eternity</b> (Zaehner, 1955:419-428).|$|E

Daniel Carter reappears as the new Supernova and saves Hunter and Booster, restoring the Phantom Zone in the process.
