25|$|A {{variation}} of the solar chimney concept is the solar attic. In a hot sunny climate the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads {{to the need for}} increased air conditioning. By integrating the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, it was {{announced}} that another room was found—an <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> that contains a pump organ, Victorian couch, dress form, sewing machine and paintings —and was made available for viewing by the public.|$|E
25|$|A single-file kitchen (also {{known as}} a one-way galley or a straight-line kitchen) has all of these along one wall; the work {{triangle}} degenerates to a line. This is not optimal, but often the only solution if space is restricted. This may be common in an <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> that is being converted into a living space, or a studio apartment.|$|E
50|$|Cooee and its unnamed {{neighbour}} originally {{formed a}} pair of semi-detached, single-storeyed brick cottages with separate, steeply pitched gabled roofs containing <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> lit by dormer windows. The galvanised iron roofs {{are likely to have}} been shingled originally.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, the roof and windows were {{replaced}} on the brick section of the college. Extra dormers were also added to the roofs so that student rooms could later be installed in the former <b>attic</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fabric ducts are {{not rated}} {{for use in}} {{ceilings}} or concealed <b>attic</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, products for use in raised floor applications are available. Fabric ducting usually weighs less than other conventional ducting and will therefore put less stress on the building's structure. The lower weight allows for easier installation.|$|R
25|$|However, the 1951 {{renovation}} nearly entirely {{eliminated the}} historical {{integrity of the}} interior of the structure, with all interior trim and nearly all the walls removed. The house was converted into four apartments, with two stairways for accessing the second-floor apartments and the <b>attic</b> <b>space.</b> All four apartments are nearly identical, with two bedrooms, a small bathroom, a kitchen, and a combined living room/dining area.|$|E
25|$|In {{the southeastern}} {{area of the}} old town is the Hofstatt, the town’s only large open square. The Zeughaus (Armory), {{completed}} in 1673, {{is located on the}} square’s northern side. The baroque structure stands out into the alley with its protruding tower topped by a bulbous dome (an architectural design that is rarely encountered in the German-speaking section of Switzerland). The southern side of the Hofstatt is flanked by the dominant Salzhaus (Salt House), which was completed in 1732, and was used to store salt until the middle of the 19th century. Other than the <b>attic</b> <b>space,</b> the building is composed entirely of one large room with twelve supporting pillars.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1957 she got her first stage {{experience}} as a walk-on at the Playhouse in Malden Bridge, New York. That small part {{was followed by a}} role as the kid sister in Picnic and one as a vamp in Desk Set. She returned to school in Brooklyn but never took dramatic arts classes, preferring instead to gain some real-world stage experience. To that end, in her sophomore year, she took a night job at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village helping backstage. When she was a senior, she rehearsed for a small part in Driftwood, a play staged in a midtown <b>attic</b> <b>space.</b> Her co-star in Driftwood was Joan Rivers.|$|E
50|$|The Cole Memorial Building {{measures}} 40 ft by 90 ft {{and has a}} full basement, {{a ground}} floor, and two small half-story <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> at {{the north and south}} ends. The walls are reinforced concrete with a stucco finish, though the gables are framed with vertical wood siding.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effect of return air leakage from hot/humid <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> on the performance of a residential air conditioner. Tests were conducted in psychrometric facilities where temperatures and humidities could be controlled closely. Return air leakage from hot <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> was simulated by assuming adiabatic mixing of the indoor air at normal conditions with the attic air at high temperatures. Effective capacity and Energy Efficiency Ratio both decreased with increased return air leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was return air leakage. The increase in sensible heat ratio (SHR) with increasing leakage showed one of the most detrimental effects of return air leakage on performance...|$|R
40|$|A task-specific {{exposure}} matrix {{was designed}} for workers installing building insulation materials. A priori, a matrix element was defined by type of task (installer or helper), type of work area (<b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> or wall cavities) and type of insulation material (slabs from mineral wool, fiberglass or flax; loose-fill cellulosic material or perlite). In the laboratory a mock-up (full scale) of a one-family house was used for simulated installation of insulation materials (four replicates per matrix element). Personal exposure to dust and fibers was measured. The dust was analyzed for content of endotoxin and some trace elements (boron and aluminum) from fire-retardant or mold-resistant additives. Fibers were characterized as WHO fibers or non-WHO fibers. In support of the exposure matrix, the dustiness of all the materials was meas-ured in a rotating drum tester. For installers in <b>attic</b> <b>spaces,</b> risk of exposure was low for inhal-ation of dust and WHO fibers from slab materials of mineral wool or fiberglass. Slab materials from flax may cause high risk of exposure to endotoxin. The risk of exposure by inhalation of dust from loose-fill materials was high for installers in <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> and {{for some of the}} materials risk of exposure was high for boron and aluminum. Exposure by inhalation of cellulosic WHO fibers was high but {{little is known about the}} health effects and a risk assessment is not possible...|$|R
25|$|The {{high heat}} storage {{capacity}} in the phase change from solid to liquid, and the advantageous phase change temperature of 32°C (90°F) makes this material especially appropriate for storing low grade solar heat for later release in space heating applications. In some applications the material is incorporated into thermal tiles that are placed in an <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> while in other applications the salt is incorporated into cells surrounded by solar–heated water. The phase change allows a substantial reduction in {{the mass of the}} material required for effective heat storage (the heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} aspects of The Magician's Nephew {{parallel}} Lewis' own life. Both Digory and Lewis were {{children in the}} early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced {{with the death of}} their mothers in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was schooled in England after his mother's death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Lewis was a voracious reader when a child, Digory is also, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when trying to work out how far they must travel along the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel. Additionally Digory becomes a professor when he grows up, who takes in evacuated children during World War II.|$|E
500|$|As Notter predicted, {{the renovated}} station {{initially}} proved attractive to commercial tenants. When an engineering firm {{moved into the}} [...] "Crow's Nest" [...] of the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> in the late 1980s, the building was fully occupied {{for the first time}} since the heyday of the New Haven railroad. However, Notter and others involved in the 1975 purchase were approaching retirement age. In the late 1990s, the city offered to buy the station for use as a maritime museum detailing the history of the adjacent Thames River. No longer worried about the safety of the building, the developers sold, and the tenants moved elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|An attic ladder (US) or loft ladder (UK) is a {{retractable}} ladder that {{is installed}} {{into the floor}} of an attic and ceiling of the floor below the attic. They are used as an inexpensive and compact alternative to having a stairway that ascends to the attic of a building. Also, fire departments carry attic ladders on fire apparatus for use to locate and extinguish fires in <b>attic</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R

50|$|Chilean myotises roost in {{holes in}} trees, rock crevices, caves, and {{artificial}} {{structures such as}} <b>attic</b> <b>spaces.</b> They emerge at dusk, and feed for about three hours before returning home to roost; unlike most other bats they do not feed again later in the night. Because of their small size and low metabolic rate, the bats often enter a daily period of torpor during which their body temperature falls to just 0.5 °C above ambient.|$|R
500|$|The {{west and}} east sides match each other. Most houses have two storeys, but some rise to three; {{all have a}} {{basement}} and a three-window range with sash windows. [...] The entrances are in the rear elevation and are paired under single doorcases with cornices, architraves and fanlights. [...] The windows are topped by similar architraves. At the front, facing the garden, the hipped roofs of the main sections have prominent eaves, and the roofs of the tower sections have similar treatment. Number 1, at the southwest corner, has ground-floor rustication carried round on to its south-facing wall, and its windows are different. Similarly, number 48—the end house at the southeast corner—has a hipped-roofed south-facing wing with a hipped roof, in which the entrance {{is set in a}} doorcase flanked by antae. [...] The corner of the house is chamfered and has a blank two-window range. Several houses in {{the east side of the}} crescent have dormer windows in their <b>attic</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The chapel is a two-storey red-brick {{building}} in a Vernacular style. [...] The roof, which has two dormer windows in the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> above the first floor, is laid with tiles at the rear and slates at the front. [...] The three-bay façade, [...] wide, has a wide doorway with a straight canopy supported by ornate brackets. [...] A twin staircase with metal railings leads to the door from the pavement. [...] A thin string course of red bricks separates the ground and first floors, which have two and three shallow-arched sash windows respectively. [...] There are two similar windows on the rear wall; originally the pulpit stood between them. [...] A small gable-ended extension at the rear {{may have been a}} vestry. [...] The interior has been opened out to form a single tall open-plan space, although the <b>attic</b> <b>space</b> has been retained.|$|E
2500|$|The façade is of knapped flint with galletting {{and stone}} quoins, dressings, buttresses and string-courses. [...] The side walls have red and grey {{brickwork}} and knapped flint. [...] The front elevation {{is divided into}} three equal-width bays by full-height ashlar-faced stone buttresses in the form of pilasters, which terminate at a stone string-course separating the gabled slate roof (enclosing <b>attic</b> <b>space)</b> from the body of the two-storey building. [...] The eaves are supported on ashlar corbels. [...] Below the gable, at the attic level, is a louvred round-arched window surrounded by roll-moulding. [...] The first floor has three tall windows with round heads, and the centrally placed entrance at ground-floor level is set into a similar arch flanked by capital-topped colonnettes (small medieval-style shafts). [...] The stone used for the window and door surrounds, string-courses and buttresses was quarried at nearby Pulborough. [...] Inside, the original gallery on the north wall (surrounding the entrance) survives, but those on the west and east sides have been removed.|$|E

50|$|Like most bats, silver-tipped myotises are nocturnal, and {{are most}} active {{immediately}} after sunset and before dawn. They {{spend the day}} roosting in small groups in holes or crevices in trees or cliffs, typically close to water. They are not cave-roosting bats, preferring more open environments {{with some degree of}} ventilation and light. In more settled areas, they are commonly found roosting under roofs, or inside <b>attic</b> <b>spaces.</b> Although they may occasionally become torpid during cold nights, they do not hibernate.|$|R

50|$|Bats harbor more viruses than rodents and {{are capable}} of {{spreading}} disease over a wider geographic area owing {{to their ability to}} fly and their migration and roosting patterns. In addition, certain species of bat, like the brown bat, favor roosts in <b>attic</b> <b>spaces</b> of human dwellings from which they often invade spaces {{in other parts of the}} structure. This brings them into contact with humans. Rodents, on the other hand, are more confined to their geographic location and seek seasonal shelter in underground burrows and in human dwellings and buildings in the immediate area.|$|R
