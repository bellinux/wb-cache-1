50|$|There {{are seven}} {{different}} copy <b>abilities,</b> and any two can be merged {{to create a}} new one. The seven basic <b>abilities</b> are Burning, Stone, Ice, Needle, Bomb, Spark, and Cutter. Though Kirby only needs one element in his body to gain an extra attack, copy <b>abilities</b> can also be merged with <b>abilities</b> of the same type for more powerful versions of the basic <b>abilities.</b> In total, there are 35 <b>abilities</b> to combine and stand-alone. Usually, combined ones are stronger or have added effects. This is the only game in the Kirby series where Kirby can combine copy <b>abilities</b> (save for the very restricted combinations with the Sword and Bomb <b>abilities</b> in Kirby: Squeak Squad).|$|R
50|$|The SOI {{model is}} {{designed}} to address learning disabilities in stages. An SOI test assesses the individual's underlying intellectual <b>abilities,</b> including the constituent <b>abilities</b> enabling performance of the targeted task. Then, after the individual's SOI profile is compared against the intellectual <b>abilities</b> that enable the targeted task (such as reading or arithmetic), specific intellectual <b>abilities</b> are identified for remediation. Finally, SOI curriculum materials train the identified <b>abilities</b> so that, after the <b>abilities</b> are remediated, the individual may learn to perform the more complex task.|$|R

It is also treated why is important to study those aspects recently mentioned in early adolescence.  Opportune diagnosis of those types of adolescent resources –or their dysfunctions like aggressiveness or isolation- would allow tracing a lay out intervention programs which promote protective <b>abilities</b> for its development which also would help the permanence in the scholar system as a way of social inclusion. Finally, it is explained how social <b>abilities</b> work as a salugenic resource in early adolescence within the frame of Positive Psychology.   </div...|$|R

According to the exceptionality of the students (high <b>abilities</b> versus non high <b>abilities)</b> the results showed that teachers perceived students with high <b>abilities</b> as being more adaptable, having greater general mood and having greater interpersonal <b>abilities.</b> Moreover, in relation to gender, teachers scored boys as having better stress management.
