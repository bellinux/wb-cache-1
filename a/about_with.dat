He practised in the playground of Littlemoor Council School, which he attended from 1921 until 1930, and at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club, which he joined as a junior.

5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved <b>about</b> <b>with</b> the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of <b>about</b> , <b>with</b> Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
