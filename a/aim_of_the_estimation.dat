40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{estimation}} of the Phillips curve in Thailand. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estimation</b> is to …t the Phillips curve as part of a small-scale, log-linearised structural model for the country, which is suitable to form the basis for a future simulation exercise to …nd an optimum monetary policy rule. A linear form of the Phillips curve is estimated using ordinary least squares estimation (OLS) under two de…nitions of the rate of in‡ation (a quarterly rate and an annual rate.) The estimation shows that in‡ation dynamics in Thailand is strongly backward-looking, with the e¤ect of output gap and import price in-‡ation being surprisingly small for such a small, open economy. The results also suggest the hypothesis that the Phillips curve relationship emerged in Thailand only after the onset of the Asian crisis. This is an interesting hypothesis for further investigation, because there is no a priori reason why the relationship should emerge only after such a strong structural shock to the country’s productive capacity and its …nancial sector. Further critical discussion on the empirical …ndings might enable us to question the usefulness of the Bank of Thailand’s in‡ation targeting regime and to question the policy rule currently in use...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies <b>the</b> interest-rate policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ECB by {{estimating}} {{monetary policy}} rules using real-time data and central bank forecasts. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estimations</b> {{is to try}} to characterize a decade of common monetary policy and to look at how different models perform at this task. The estimated rules include: contemporary Taylor rules, forward-looking Taylor rules, nonlinear rules and forecast-based rules. The nonlinear models allow for <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> zone-like preferences and an asymmetric response to key variables. The models therefore encompass the most popular sub-group of simple models used for policy analysis as well as the more unusual non-linear approach. In addition to the empirical work, this thesis also contains a more general discussion of monetary policy rules mostly from a New Keynesian perspective. This discussion includes an overview of some notable related studies, optimal policy, policy gradualism and several other related subjects. <b>The</b> regression <b>estimations</b> are performed with either least squares or <b>the</b> generalized method <b>of</b> moments depending on <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estimations.</b> <b>The</b> <b>estimations</b> use data from both the Euro Area Real-Time Database and the central bank forecasts published in ECB Monthly Bulletins. These data sources represent some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best data that is available for this kind <b>of</b> analysis. <b>The</b> main results <b>of</b> this thesis are that forward-looking behavior appears highly prevalent, but that standard forward-looking Taylor rules offer only ambivalent results with regard to inflation. Nonlinear models are shown to work, {{but on the other hand}} do not have a strong rationale over a simpler linear formulation. However, the forecasts appear to be highly useful in characterizing policy and may offer the most accurate depiction of a predominantly forward-looking central bank. In particular the inflation response appears much stronger while the output response becomes highly forward-looking as well...|$|R

40|$|We {{are proposing}} a new method for {{estimating}} soil surface water content from thermal inertia distributions retrieved from visible–near infrared (VISNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) images. A drying experiment {{was conducted on}} three fi ne-textured soils while acquiring multispectral VIS-NIR and TIR images. Simultaneous measurements of soil water content and thermal inertia were conducted by the thermogravimetric method and the heat pulse technique, respectively. Direct measurements were {{used to test the}} thermal inertia approach proposed by Murray and Verhoef that requires only knowledge of soil porosity and can be easily inverted to derive soil water content from thermal inertia. For the three considered soils, <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Murray and Verhoef model was practically equal to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional approach based on <b>the</b> direct <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> thermal conductivity and heat capacity, which requires more detailed information about soil properties.

We focus here on spatial-frequency diversity in multichannel communication with multiple antennas extracting robust features that are sensitive to target presence and position. In addition, we propose a tool based on subspace decomposition method to select the radio signal components that are more sensitive to target presence, for <b>the</b> twofold <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> increasing <b>the</b> location <b>estimation</b> accuracy, without penalizing the processing complexity. To this end, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface design adopted in off-the-shelf WiFi networks, i.e., IEEE 802.11 n and IEEE 802.11 ac, and focus on standard PHY-based CSI report fields. Such fields carry explicit channel quality information, commonly measured for standard compliant transmitter (TX) receiver (RX) low-level link adaptation, as well as for PHY-based equalization. Focusing on <b>the</b> general problem <b>of</b> passive body occupancy inference, different CSI features are considered that leverage body-induced alterations of estimated power measurements as well as antenna/frequency correlation profiles.

Material and methods: The study concerned 895 clinical specimens, collected from 471 patients. The most frequently analyzed specimen was tracheal aspirate. Fungal isolation, identification and susceptibility testing were performed by means of conventional and automatic methods (BacT/Alert 3 D, Vitek 2 Compact, bioMérieux, Polska Sp. z o. o.). Results: Fungal strains were isolated from 441 (93. 6 %) patients.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Lyme borreliosis (LB) {{is a disease}} caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. The most common symptoms {{are related to the}} skin, musculo-scelatal system, central and peripheral nervous system, rarely to the heart muscle and the eye, and may occur in <b>the</b> multistage course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. LB may additionally be accompanied by psychopathological symptoms. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and affective disorders occurence in patients with LB. Material and Methods The study was carried out in <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> 121 patients (61 females, 60 males) aged 18 – 65; mean age 46 years. All patients were diagnosed with late-stage of LB: 46 patients (38 %) with Lyme arthritis and 75 patients (62 %) with neuroborreliosis. Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and affective functioning of patients was performed on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a standardized interview and test methods: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results Cognitive disorders occurred statistically significantly more often in patients with neuroborreliosis (14. 7 %) than in patients with Lyme arthritis (4. 3 %). A group of females with neuroborreliosis and a group <b>of</b> males with <b>the</b> same diagnosis demonstrated cognitive deficits significantly more often (23. 3 % and 8. 9 %, respectively), compared to groups of patients with Lyme arthritis (6. 5 % in females and no cognitive deficits in males). A significantly higher percentage of depressive disorders was also noted in <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> males and females with neuroborreliosis (50. 7 %), compared to <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> patients with Lyme arthritis (39. 1 %). <b>The</b> symptoms <b>of</b> depression were particularly frequent in the females with neuroborreliosis (60 %). <b>The</b> severity <b>of</b> depression measured by BDI was mild or moderate in most cases.
