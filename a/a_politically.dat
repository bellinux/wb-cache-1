5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, but she may have discreetly converted to Catholicism at some point, <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish Kirk and caused suspicion in Anglican England.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe {{feelings}} by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House {{to name the}} dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> neutral basis.|$|E
5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie {{to speak to}} the press to contain the incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of the}} family. She later watches her mother do a light-hearted appearance on Sesame Street, to defend her right to practice medicine even after voluntarily giving up her licence. This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> active citizenry, and {{populism}} has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent. Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls with evidence of residency.|$|E

5|$|Radford was {{promoted}} to vice admiral in late 1945. For a time he was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. In the post-war period Radford was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford suggested he double the number, <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> unrealistic proposal.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{was portrayed}} by Dutch actress Carice van Houten in Race, a sports drama film {{directed}} by Stephen Hopkins about Jesse Owens. It {{was released in}} North America on February 19, 2016. To make her sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, Olympia, especially about filming the African American star who {{is proving to be}} <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The Council of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> {{independent}} {{think tank}} dedicated to {{defence and security}} issues, elected Dannatt as the Institute's Chairman in June 2009.

He was eventually succeeded by former Defence Secretary John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces in Sierra Leone. The government was seeking an exit strategy that would end <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{passed into}} royal control, and Edward {{considered}} it a useful fortress for protection against the threat from Scotland. Initially it was managed by Robert de Emeldon, a merchant from Newcastle, and protected by a garrison of 40 men at arms and 40 light horsemen. Roger Maduit, <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> rehabilitated former member of Thomas's army, was appointed as constable, followed by Sir John de Lilburn, a Northumberland schavaldour in 1323, who was in turn replaced by Roger Heron.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was <b>a</b> <b>politically</b> tumultuous time.|$|E
