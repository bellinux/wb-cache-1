5|$|Sonic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies in his path.|$|E

5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog faced a {{difficult}} production cycle. Development began in 2004 following {{the completion of}} Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003).

The game was rushed to market in time for the holiday season; versions for the Wii and Microsoft Windows were cancelled.

5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E

(Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> code of the animal groups becomes widespread.
