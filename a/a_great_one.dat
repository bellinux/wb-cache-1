5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>one</b> to portray in terms of acting.|$|E

Grant Fuhr was also suspended for 60 games for drug abuse. The season itself was not <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>one</b> for the Oilers: they finished with 37 wins and 80 points, good for third place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Oilers met the Flames in the opening round. In a thrilling series, the Oilers won the series in seven games, led by seven goals by Esa Tikkanen. Despite injuries suffered in the series with Calgary, they defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games. Their success was unable to continue into the Conference Final, however, as they lost in five games to the Minnesota North Stars, who were making their Cinderella run.|$|E

These players would prove to be the core of the Colts team for the next four years. Also added to the roster were forwards Cory McGillis, and T.J. Battani, as well as defenceman Mike Weber. Although finishing top in their conference, the playoffs were a disappointment for the Colts who, after defeating Brampton Battalion in four games, were swept by the sixth place Sudbury Wolves in the conference semi-finals.|$|E
