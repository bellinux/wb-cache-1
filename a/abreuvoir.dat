50|$|An <b>abreuvoir</b> is a {{watering}} trough, fountain, {{or other}} installed basin: {{originally intended to}} provide humans and/or animals a rural or urban watering place with fresh drinking water. They were often located at springs. In pre-automobile era cities they were built as equestrian water troughs for horses providing transportation. In contemporary times abreuvoirs are also seen as civic or private fountains in the designed townscape-landscape.|$|E
5000|$|His finest {{works are}} the famous {{group of the}} [...] "Horse Tamers" [...] (Chevaux de Marly), which reinvent {{the theme of the}} colossal Roman marbles of the Horse Tamers in the Piazza Quirinale, Rome. They were {{commissioned}} by Louis XV in 1739 and installed in 1745 at the <b>Abreuvoir</b> ("Horse Trough") at Marly. The familiar versions (illustration, left) {{at the entrance to the}} Champs-Élysées, Paris are cast reproductions.|$|E
50|$|A manger, or trough, is a {{structure}} {{used to hold}} food to feed animals. The word manger originally referred to a feed-trough, {{but it may also}} be used to refer to a water-trough when this is not being used possibly because it is similar to an <b>abreuvoir.</b> Mangers are generally found at stables and farmhouses. A manger is generally made of either stone or wood or metal. Mangers are mostly used in livestock raising.|$|E
5000|$|The Sun King {{attended}} {{the opening of}} the completed hydraulic works in June 1684 http://world.std.com/~hmfh/machine1.htm and by 1686 development was sufficiently advanced for the King to stay there for the first time, with a picked entourage. The theme of Marly was that it was a simple hunting lodge, just enough to accommodate the Royal Hunt. In 1688 the Grand <b>Abreuvoir</b> à chevaux was installed on the terrace, a mere [...] "horse trough." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the water}} poured out the canon, {{it would be}} {{captured}} in an earthenware jar and carried home. The water not taken this way went into a stone <b>abreuvoir,</b> or basin, where it could be drunk by cattle, sheep or horses. The overflow water went then into a separate basin, a lavoir, where {{it could be used}} for washing clothes. The overflow water was then used for irrigating gardens. Since the traditional village way of washing clothes was to use wood cinders as a detergent, which were rich in potassium, the wash water was an efficient fertilizer for the gardens.|$|E
50|$|Willot {{initially}} helped distribute Fr. Pinte's newsletters in Roubaix, {{and then}} from February 1915, began to produce newspapers for Lille, with a printing press in his laboratory at the rue du Vieil <b>Abreuvoir.</b> The underground journals had several successive names (L'Oiseau de France, La Patience, La Voix de la Patrie, etc.) until the network was discovered in 1916. Willot's wife joined the activities, writing a column aimed at the wives and mothers of French soldiers. Joseph Willot and his two partners were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in Rheinbach, Germany. Willot was released after the Armistice, but died on 1 April 1919, having become ill in prison. He was made a posthumous member of the Legion d'Honneur.|$|E
