5|$|Gloria's {{high winds}} downed {{numerous}} trees <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England, causing minor to moderate damage. In the region, Connecticut received {{the worst of}} the hurricane, where tree and structural damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. New Hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding. In Maine, damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees. High winds <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England resulted in significant power outages, leaving 250,000 in Maine. In all, seven deaths occurred in New England, many of which occurred from falling tree limbs.|$|E

5|$|Barrhill flourished {{until about}} 1885, when {{population}} in the village itself peaked at 50, and two effects caused a population decline. Firstly, a recession set in <b>across</b> <b>New</b> Zealand that made people move to where work opportunities presented themselves, and locally those opportunities were created near the stations of the Methven Branch railway. Wason began to gradually sell off parts of his land holdings from the mid-1880s.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{species of}} melampitta is {{believed}} to be threatened with extinction. The greater melampitta is not generally common <b>across</b> <b>New</b> Guinea, but appears to be relatively common in its preferred habitat type when that habitat is studied. The lesser melampitta is less restricted in its habitat requirements and is common over a large area. Because of this, and the fact that their habitat is not considered to be threatened and their populations are considered to be stable, both species are listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived <b>across</b> <b>New</b> Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} prompted {{standard precautions}} in the Bahamas and Florida, {{although it did}} not affect the region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced winds up to 55mph (90km/h) and high waves, and <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England there were nine traffic fatalities. The hurricane killed 2people in Canada and caused over $1million in damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arlene {{combined with a}} non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall <b>across</b> <b>New</b> York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7inches (150 to 175mm) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials calling it a 1 in 500year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from their homes, and numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Damage totaled to $6.5million (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|The winds from Isabel downed {{hundreds}} {{of trees and}} power lines <b>across</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, leaving {{hundreds of}} thousands without power; a falling tree killed one person.

5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations {{were located in}} Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Officials said the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There has been increasing interest in further expansion <b>across</b> <b>New</b> York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Every storm but {{the fourth}} {{hurricane}} affected land during the season. The first hurricane hit Matagorda, Texas in July, {{the only one}} of the season to hit the United States as a hurricane. A month later a hurricane made two landfalls in Mexico. The third hurricane of the season formed near Bermuda and was last observed along the southern coast of Newfoundland. A few weeks later another storm executed a similar track, although it struck Newfoundland as a hurricane and caused damage. The most notable storm of the season was the Great Nassau Hurricane, which killed at least 383people in the Turks and Caicos, Bahamas, and the western Atlantic Ocean. It attained winds of 140mph (220km/h), which is a Category4 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The final hurricane developed over the Bahamas and later struck New Jersey, producing strong winds and high tides <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{remained}} inactive for {{the next}} half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay. The British quickly occupied the city.

Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated <b>across</b> <b>New</b> Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carol {{produced}} hurricane and gale force winds <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England. Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple, corn, peach, {{and tomato}} crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage {{was estimated at}} $22.25million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England, {{many of which were}} destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720houses that were damaged and 1,545that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000people without power in New England, potentially as many as one-third of all of New England, and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500cars and 3,000boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents, but only minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|On August28, a {{tropical}} wave developed into {{a tropical}} depression near Cape Verde. After moving west-southwestward, it turned to the northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August31 and into a hurricane on September2. Passing northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Carol rapidly intensified to Category 5 intensity, reaching peak winds of 160mph (260km/h) on September3, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, bypassing Bermuda on September6 and producing high waves. Carol later turned to the north-northeast, brushing Cape Cod and causing boating accidents <b>across</b> <b>New</b> England. Four {{people were killed in}} the region. Fishing losses totaled around $1million (1953USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed <b>across</b> <b>New</b> York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the back wall. On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
