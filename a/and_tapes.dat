5|$|Kim was {{introduced}} to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) employee Nora Greenwald (known on-screen as Molly Holly) by Jason Sensation in 2001; Greenwald encouraged Kim to send her videos <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> to WWF officials. In October 2002, she {{was hired by the}} WWF, now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). She spent eight months training in their then-developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) and wrestled house shows and dark matches before being called up to their main roster. After several weeks of vignettes showcasing Matrix-like effects aired on Raw, Kim debuted on June 30 as a fan favorite, with a Matrix-inspired outfit.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
5|$|Mulder discovers a signal, {{possibly}} {{originating from}} an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport {{to fly to}} Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> of the signals—the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practical}} {{audio tape}} recorder was unveiled in 1935. Improvements {{to the technology}} were made using the AC biasing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity. As early as 1942, test recordings were being made in stereo. Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> {{were brought to the}} United States following the end of World War II. These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.|$|E

25|$|The Free Software Foundation {{was founded}} in 1985 as a {{non-profit}} corporation supporting free software development. It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals <b>and</b> <b>tapes,</b> and employed developers of the free software system.

The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and {{has the ability to}} make revisions as needed.|$|E
25|$|Nick Hornby's {{book was}} optioned by Disney's Touchstone Pictures in 1995 where {{it went into}} {{development}} for three years. Disney executive Joe Roth {{had a conversation with}} recording executive Kathy Nelson who recommended John Cusack and his writing and producing partners D. V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink adapt the book. She had worked previously with them on Grosse Pointe Blank and felt that they had the right sensibilities for the material. According to Cusack, DeVincentis is the closest to the record-obsessive characters in the film, owning 1,000 vinyl records and thousands of CDs <b>and</b> <b>tapes.</b> They wrote a treatment that was immediately greenlit by Roth.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the American and British {{counterculture}} and hippie {{movement had}} moved rock towards psychedelia, heavy metal, progressive rock and other styles that incorporated socially and politically incisive lyrics. The 1968 German student movement, French protests and Italian student movement had created a class of young, intellectual continental listeners, while nuclear weapons, pollution, and war inspired protests and activism. Avant-garde music had taken a turn towards the electronic in the mid-1950s. The avant-garde minimalist music current emerged in the early 1960s with the works of Americans La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. They used drones and loops (often with synthesizers <b>and</b> <b>tapes)</b> in a kind of psychedelic and space-oriented music.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{appeared}} to have spent little time in the Volta Laboratory. Tainter's unpublished manuscript and notes (later donated to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History) depict Bell {{as the person who}} suggested the basic lines of research, furnished the financial resources, and then allowed his associates to receive the credit for many of the inventions that resulted. The experimental machines built at the Volta Laboratory include both disc and cylinder types, with some of the disc type turntables rotating vertically about a horizontal axis, as well as a hand-powered, non-magnetic tape recorder. The records <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> used with the machines were donated to the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History, and were believed to be the oldest reproducible bona fide sound recordings preserved anywhere in the world. While some were scratched and cracked, others were still in good condition when they were received.|$|E
25|$|Clubs: Multi-piece {{clubs are}} the most popular clubs. The club is built along an {{internal}} rod, providing a base on which a handle made of polyolefin plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex, cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from 19 to 21 inches (480 to 530mm). The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics <b>and</b> <b>tapes.</b> The skills involved are apparatus mastery and body elements, Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first. However, double and triple spins are frequently performed, allowing the club to be thrown higher for more advanced patterns and to allow tricks such as 360s to be performed underneath.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{referred}} to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone: [...] "They weren't demos for myself, they were demos of the songs. I was being PUSHED again into {{coming up with}} some songs. You know how those things go." [...] In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman. Acetates <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists.|$|E
50|$|Morris Pert {{was born}} and raised in Arbroath Scotland where he played in percussion, folk and rock bands and began to compose. He gained a Trinity College diploma in piano {{performance}} in 1967 and a Bachelor of Music degree from Edinburgh University in 1969. He then studied in London on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music with Alan Bush and James Blades. He was a prize-winning student, notably the 1970 Royal Philharmonic Society Award for his orchestral work Xumbu-Ata, which was broadcast by the BBC.

[...] The message [...] "this recording {{is meant to be}} listened to on vinyl" [...] is printed on some CD issues of Spiderland, demonstrating Slint's preference of analog audio devices.|$|E
500|$|Larkin {{has taught}} {{coursework}} in the Department of Sociology at the Newark College of Arts and Science of Rutgers University, {{and was also}} {{a professor at the}} Center for the Study of Evaluation, University of California, Los Angeles Graduate School of Education.

[...] "The judge said the tapes were incendiary. We have plenty of things already that stimulate violence," [...] said Larkin. Prior to writing the book, Larkin had given a seminar at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice's Center on Terrorism, entitled: [...] "From Oklahoma City to Columbine: Paramilitary Influences on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold."

500|$|Slint {{formed in}} 1987 in Louisville, Kentucky, from the {{remnants}} of the punk rock band Squirrel Bait; the founding members included Brian McMahan (guitar, vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums) and Ethan Buckler (bass guitar). The band's debut album, the Steve Albini-produced Tweez, was released on the group's self-owned label Jennifer Hartman Records <b>and</b> <b>Tapes.</b> Touch and Go / Quarterstick Records |work=touchandgorecords.com |accessdate=October 13, 2012}} The album's sound {{has been described as a}} combination of [...] "scratchy guitars, thumping bass lines and hard hitting drums".

500|$|Just {{prior to}} this, Delorentos {{had come to}} wider {{attention}} when they represented Ireland at the National Student Music Awards (NSMA) in Dublin on 31 March 2005, where they were chosen as the Best Student Artist in the UK and Ireland. As part of their prize, they received free recording time at the BBC's Maida Vale recording studios and were invited onto the UK television show , on which they confirmed the UK release date of their debut EP Leave It On. The band followed this with another Irish tour and appeared on The Cafe in 2006 and 2007. They toured with other more established bands such as Idlewild, Bell X1, Whitey, The Futureheads, Gang of Four <b>and</b> <b>Tapes</b> 'n Tapes in locations such as London, New York City, Chicago and Toronto. Delorentos featured at both Oxegen and Electric Picnic in 2006, becoming the first unsigned act to perform at both festivals.

500|$|Later in 2015, Corgan {{announced}} that the band would undertake a co-headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson. The End Times Tour was set to begin in Concord, California, at the Concord Pavilion on July 7, and was scheduled to end with a concert in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the Riverbend Music Center on August 8. Prior to the co-headlining dates, the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum machines <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> for percussion. When the time came for the co-headlining tour, plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows. On February 1, 2016, it was {{announced that}} the band would continue their In Plainsong acoustic tour with Jimmy Chamberlin on drums and were planning to head [...] "straight to the studio after the dates to record a brand new album inspired by the sounds explored in the new acoustic setting".

500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role <b>and</b> <b>tapes</b> of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
