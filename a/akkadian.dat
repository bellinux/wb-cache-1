5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the <b>Akkadian</b> empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early <b>Akkadian</b> periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early <b>Akkadian</b> monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E
5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the <b>Akkadian</b> word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the <b>Akkadian</b> Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the <b>Akkadian</b> kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in <b>Akkadian</b> would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E

5|$|During the Lim era, the {{population}} became predominantly Amorite but also included <b>Akkadian</b> named people, {{and although the}} Amorite language became the dominant tongue, <b>Akkadian</b> remained the language of writing. The pastoral Amorites in Mari were called the Haneans, a term that indicate nomads in general, those Haneans were split into the Banu-Yamina (sons of the right) and Banu-Simaal (sons of the left), with the ruling house belonging to the Banu-Simaal branch. The kingdom was also a home to tribes of Suteans {{who lived in the}} district of Terqa.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that in the {{original}} <b>Akkadian,</b> Ú-a-a-te is used to refer to the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of the original <b>Akkadian</b> into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E
5|$|No Hurrian {{names are}} {{recorded}} in the pre-Akkadian period, although the name of prince Ultum-Huhu is difficult to understand as Semitic. During the <b>Akkadian</b> period, both Semitic and Hurrian names were recorded, as the Hurrians appears to {{have taken advantage of}} the power vacuum caused by the destruction of the pre-Akkadian kingdom, in order to migrate and expand in the region. The post-Akkadian period Tell Brak had a strong Hurrian element, and Hurrian named rulers, although the region was also inhabited by Amorite tribes. A number of the Amorite Banu-Yamina tribes settled the surroundings of Tell Brak during the reign of Zimri-Lim of Mari, and each group used its own language (Hurrian and Amorite languages). Tell Brak was a center of the Hurrian-Mitannian empire, which had Hurrian as its official language. However, <b>Akkadian</b> was the region's international language, evidenced by the post-Akkadian and Mitannian eras tablets, discovered at Tell Brak and written in <b>Akkadian.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Amorites in Qatna spoke {{their own}} language, but kings communicated with their {{counterparts}} using <b>Akkadian,</b> {{which was the}} language of writing in the city. Qatna's <b>Akkadian</b> became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special AkkadianHurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was prominent among scribes, but its predominance as a spoken language {{by the general public}} cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|The tablets {{were written}} in <b>Akkadian,</b> and they give {{information}} about the kingdom, its customs, {{and the names of}} people who lived during that time. More than 3000 are letters, the remainder includes administrative, economic, and judicial texts. Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50years of Mari's independence (c. 1800 – 1750BC), and most have now been published. The language of the texts is official <b>Akkadian</b> but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari's inhabitants was Northwest Semitic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the <b>Akkadian</b> Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E

5|$|<b>Akkadian</b> hypothesis: Both kings Sargon of Akkad and his {{grandson}} Naram-Sin {{claimed to have}} destroyed a town called Ibla, The discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, considers Sargon a more likely culprit; his view is supported by Trevor Bryce, but rejected by Michael Astour.|$|E
5|$|Mari {{was deserted}} for two generations before being {{restored}} by the <b>Akkadian</b> king Manishtushu. A governor {{was appointed to}} govern the city who held the title Shakkanakku (military governor). Akkad kept direct control over the city, which is evident by Naram-Sin of Akkad's appointment of two of his daughters to priestly offices in the city.|$|E
5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early <b>Akkadian</b> period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of <b>Akkadian</b> officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{study of}} {{language}} is often {{considered to have}} started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and <b>Akkadian</b> grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed {{in all of the}} ancient cultures that adopted writing.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of excavations, over 25,000 clay tablets in <b>Akkadian</b> language written in cuneiform were discovered. Finds from the excavation are {{on display in the}} Louvre, the National Museum of Aleppo, the National Museum of Damascus, and the Deir ez-Zor Museum. In the latter, the southern façade of the Court of the Palms room from Zimri-Lim's palace has been reconstructed, including the wall paintings.|$|E
5|$|At its height, {{the second}} city {{was the home}} of about 40,000 people. This {{population}} was East-Semitic speaking one, and used a dialect much similar {{to the language of}} Ebla (the Eblaite language), while the Shakkanakku period had an East-Semitic <b>Akkadian</b> speaking population. West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, even among the ruling dynasty members.|$|E

Jesup and Rama are hit by arrows, but Mathayus manages to sneak into the sorcerer's tent, where he sees that the sorcerer is actually a sorceress, Cassandra. Mathayus is ambushed and meets Memnon himself, who brutally executes Jesup in front of him, and is about to kill Mathayus too. Cassandra, however, tells Memnon that the gods wish Mathayus to survive the night, and to defy them will incur their wrath and cost him his victories. Memnon has Mathayus buried to his neck in the desert to be devoured by fire ants at dawn, but he manages to escape with help from a horse thief, Arpid.|$|R

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the city, a royal palace was built which also served as a temple. Four {{successive}} architectural levels from the second kingdom's palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated P3, while the latest is P0), and the last two levels are dated to the <b>Akkadian</b> period. The first two levels were excavated; the findings include a temple named Enceinte Sacrée, which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated. Also unearthed were a pillared throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple.|$|E
5|$|Mardikh II's periods {{shared the}} same culture. the {{population}} of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semites, close to their North-Western Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, {{one of the oldest}} attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others said it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the <b>Akkadian</b> language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East-Semitic language which exhibits both West-Semitic and East-Semitic features.|$|E
5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the <b>Akkadian</b> and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; {{the first is a}} cart with fixed seats and the second is a cart where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E
