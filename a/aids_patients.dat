5|$|Laubenstein {{was raised}} in Barrington, Rhode Island, where a {{childhood}} bout of polio left her paraplegic and using a wheelchair {{for the rest of}} her life. She studied at Barnard College and received her medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, where she specialized in hematology and oncology and went on to become a clinical professor before leaving to focus on treating <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> in her private practice. In addition to her medical work, she was an outspoken AIDS activist and co-founded a non-profit organization, Multitasking, which provided employment to people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients,</b> and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E

Campbell also became involved with the Shanti Project (which moved from its original focus, supporting people with terminal cancer, to help provide emotional support to people diagnosed with AIDS coming to terms with death) and persuaded reluctant physicians to allow him to meet and counsel <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> at Conant's KS clinic.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her acting career, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes. She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre. In 2001, she auctioned an outfit she wore in The Mask of Zorro (1998) {{to raise funds for}} <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> in Africa. In 2005, she became the ambassador of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse. She has also given her support to other charitable organisations for children such as the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and the Noah's Ark Appeal, among others. Zeta-Jones is also the founding host for A Fine Romance, an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, {{and is one of the}} members of the Cinema for Peace Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients,</b> activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E

25|$|In immunocompromised individuals, such as <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients,</b> {{cryptosporidiosis}} resolves slowly {{or not at}} all, {{and frequently}} causes a particularly severe and persistent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. As a result, infected individuals may experience severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and potentially death. In general, the mortality rate for infected <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> is based on CD4+ marker counts. Patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm³ recover with supportive hospital care and medication; but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³, the effects are usually fatal within 3 to 6months. During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of <b>AIDS</b> <b>patients</b> with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm³ and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm³ died within {{the first year of}} contracting the infection.|$|E

40|$|Background: Physiotherapist {{prescribed}} self-management {{strategies are}} an important adjunct to 'hands on' treatment. However, treatment outcomes {{are likely to be}} related to whether patients adhere to the prescribed strategy. Therefore, physiotherapists should be aware of adherence aiding interventions designed to maximise patient outcomes underpinned by quality research studies. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the interventions used to <b>aid</b> <b>patient</b> adherence to all physiotherapist prescribed self-management strategies. Data sources: The search included the databases CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED, PSYCINFO, SPORTSDiscus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro and Mednar for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in a peer reviewed journal from inception to November 2014. Data extraction and synthesis: Data were extracted using a standardised form from twelve included RCTs for patient adherence rates to self-management strategies for interventions used to <b>aid</b> <b>patient</b> adherence and usual care. Two independent reviewers conducted methodological quality assessment. Results: Twelve different interventions to <b>aid</b> <b>patient</b> adherence to exercise were recorded from twelve fair to high quality RCTs. Potential adherence aiding interventions include an activity monitor and feedback system, written exercise instructions, behavioural exercise programme with booster sessions and goal setting. Conclusion and implications of key findings: Despite a number of studies demonstrating interventions to positively influence patient adherence to exercise, there is insufficient data to endorse their use in clinical practice. No RCTs examining adherence aiding interventions to self-management strategies other than exercise were identified, indicating a significant gap in the literature.
