5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E
5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for mental health workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National Mental Health Foundation. Initially skeptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of the National Mental Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J. Roberts, Pearl Buck and Harry Emerson Fosdick to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} {{database}} analysis method {{aimed at the}} process of building a new ontology. The analysis is {{based on the idea that}} a database already contains indirect knowledge of the domain. By finding information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> contained in <b>the</b> database tables and fields, it is possible to extract some of this knowledge. The obtained information can then be used as the basis for ontology concept creation. The information consists of statistical information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> in a field, detected distinct values and their distributions, and implicit foreign-key to primary-key relationship detection. Different aspects of <b>the</b> information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> in <b>the</b> fields, obtained from the analysis, can be used to create value-based and other ontology concepts. The proposed method has been applied on a medical database, containing records about respondents in a study of gastric cancer risk. The inconsistencies and hurdles from working with a database and ways of dealing with them are also discussed in the paper...|$|R

This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as {{was used for the}} FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion. Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a {{minority}} of commentators questioned the validity of his title. Kramnik also made ambiguous comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself.

25|$|The U.S. Army Air Service had a {{brief but}} {{turbulent}} history. Created during World War I by executive order of 28th President Woodrow Wilson after American entrance in April 1917 as {{the increasing use of}} airplanes and the military uses of aviation were readily apparent as the war continued to its climax, the U.S. Army Air Service gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the United States Army. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any other factor.|$|E
25|$|The seven-year {{history of}} the post-war Air Service was marked by a {{prolonged}} debate between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of an independent Air Force.

The Army's senior leadership from World War I, the United States Navy, {{and the majority of}} the nation's political leadership favored integration of all military aviation into the Army and Navy. Aided by a wave of pacifism following the war that drastically cut military budgets, opponents of an independent air force prevailed. The Air Service was renamed the Army Air Corps in 1926 as a compromise in the continuing struggle.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} 20 years {{there has been}} an overt change in the {{policies}} of governments of Mesoamerican countries towards the indigenous languages. There has been official recognition of their right to existence and some kind of governmental support, to the point of recognizing them as national languages. Bilingual (rather than monolingual Spanish) education has been recognized as desirable even if not always actually achieved in practice. In Guatemala the recognition of the indigenous languages as official languages and a valuable part of the country’s identity came after the Civil War which ended in 1996. In Mexico shifting governments had talked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the country’s indigenous heritage {{but it was not until}} 2003 that the Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages.|$|E
