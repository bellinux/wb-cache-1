5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried <b>along</b> <b>on</b> tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go <b>along</b> <b>on</b> anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E

It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting against witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey at all costs. Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe, an upperclassman at the same school {{who is also a}} magical girl and offers to bring them <b>along</b> <b>on</b> her witch hunts so that they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton <b>along</b> <b>on</b> their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that his story is not true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T'Pol – who {{has been}} invited to accept a Starfleet {{commission}} – takes the opportunity to travel to Vulcan to visit her mother, T'Les. When Commander Tucker mentions {{that he does not}} have a home to go to, T'Pol invites him <b>along.</b> <b>On</b> Vulcan, after a tense homecoming, she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T'Pol's actions at the P'Jem sanctuary. One logical way for T'Pol to restore her mother's position is to honor her engagement to Koss, a member of an influential family. Despite Tucker's feelings, who admits to T'Les' observation that he is in love with T'Pol, she consents to marry Koss. Just before the ceremony begins, however, T'Pol quickly kisses Tucker on the cheek.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Dunphy family, Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend, tags <b>along</b> <b>on</b> the trip, much to Claire's chagrin. However, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{eventually}} convinces {{her that}} she should {{try to get to}} know Dylan. She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) around the campfire one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals she would not have accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd (Lahore) Division's 7th and 8th Brigades {{began their}} advance at 05:00. The 7th Brigade's 91st Punjabis (Light Infantry) began their advance towards 'Azzun, while the 8th Brigade moved along the Wadi 'Azzun. As the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment moved {{along the south}} bank, and the 47th Sikhs moved <b>along</b> <b>on</b> the north bank, with the 59th Scinde Rifles in the rear; they quickly found {{themselves}} in a critical position. The leading battalions encountered about 200 German soldiers and 12 machine guns in a well-sited rearguard position south of the wadi. Without any artillery support, an extended battle followed. The 59th Scinde Rifles were ordered to join the fight and a howitzer was rushed forward from the 428th Battery, coming into effective action at 12:30, when resistance almost immediately ceased.|$|E
5|$|Various stories emerged about Edward’s deathbed wishes; {{according}} to one tradition, he requested that his heart be carried to the Holy Land, along with an army to fight the infidels. A more dubious story tells of how he wished for his bones to be carried <b>along</b> <b>on</b> future expeditions against the Scots. Another account of his deathbed scene is more credible; {{according to}} one chronicle, Edward gathered around him the Earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Aymer de Valence, and Robert Clifford, and charged them with looking after his son Edward. In particular they should make sure that Piers Gaveston {{was not allowed to}} return to the country. This wish, however, the son ignored, and had his favourite recalled from exile almost immediately. The new king, EdwardII, remained in the north until August, but then abandoned the campaign and headed south. He was crowned king on 25February 1308.|$|E

5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further <b>along</b> <b>on</b> US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Kudo (Japanese: Shinichi Kudo) is a {{high school}} detective who {{sometimes}} works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mouri) and her father Richard (Kogoro), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags <b>along</b> <b>on</b> Richard's cases, but when {{he is able to}} solve one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Richard to sleep, and impersonates his voice to reveal the solution to the case. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena (Sonoko), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), various police detectives from different regions, and the Kaito Kid.|$|E
5|$|When {{the force}} marched west in 1873, it brought twenty-five British Army 1868 pattern lances <b>along</b> <b>on</b> the {{expedition}} {{to impress the}} Blackfoot First Nation. The force also used swords, with the 1822 pattern British Light Cavalry sabre approved for commissioned officers, and the non-commissioned officers carrying the British 1853 pattern weapon; some constables unofficially equipped themselves with swords, despite Commissioner French having doubts about their utility. The policy around the carrying of these weapons was reviewed in 1880, due to concerns that swords were no longer practical in conflicts with the First Nations. Commissioner Irvine wanted to equip all of his force with swords for use in close quarter combat, while the authorities in Ottawa were opposed to any extension; as a compromise, some 1822 pattern swords were purchased for storage in the police armouries. In 1882, non-commissioned officers were authorised to carry the 1822 pattern sabre, and commissioned police officers adopted the new British 1896 pattern cavalry sword when it was issued a few years later. The mounted police deployed to Siberia {{at the end of}} the First World War carried the 1908 pattern cavalry sword.|$|E

5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag <b>along</b> <b>on</b> surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them <b>along</b> <b>on</b> missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E
