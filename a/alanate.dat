Embedding vanadium in the alumina does not yield an increase in uptake rate compared to the vanadium covered oxide layers. These results add {{to the understanding of the}} hydrogen uptake of oxidized metals, especially the <b>alanates,</b> where the addition of titanium has been found to significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen uptake.

40|$|The synthesis, {{structural}} characterisation and {{the properties}} of the Zintl hydrides AeE 2 H 2 and AeAlSiH (Ae = Ba, Ca, Sr; E = Al, Ga, In, Si, Zn) are reported. The first hydride in this class of compounds is SrAl 2 H 2 which was discovered under an experiment by Gingl, who hydrogenated SrAl 2 at various temperatures. (Gingl et al, Journal of Alloys and Compounds 306 (2000) 127 - 132). The intention was to form <b>alanates,</b> e. g. AlH 4 -, by terminating the three dimensional four connected aluminium network in SrAl 2. The new hydride, SrAl 2 H 2, has a partially conserved aluminium network. The three dimensional anionic network in SrAl 2 is reduced to two dimensions in the hydride, with aluminium bonded to both aluminium and hydrogen. This type of bonding configuration has not been observed before. The hydrogenation of SrAl 2 is straight forward, 190 oC and 50 bar, compared to the difficult synthesis of <b>alanates</b> and alane, AlH 3. The latter synthesises uses aluminium in its zero oxidation state in contrast to the synthesis of SrAl 2 H 2 from SrAl 2. (In the SrAl 2 -precursor aluminium is reduced by the electropositive metal to -I.) Thus, the discovery shows a different route to <b>alanates</b> by using precursors with aluminium in a reduced state. If SrAl 2 H 2 is further hydrogenated at 250 oC the two dimensional network breaks and Sr 2 AlH 7 forms. We wanted to investigate if SrAl 2 H 2 was a singularity or if other similar compounds exist. We wanted to study how hydrogenation of precursors similar to the aluminide result in 1) new routes to compounds with high hydrogen content, as <b>alanates,</b> 2) to investigate how the E-H bond is affected as function of the network composition among different ternary hydrides, in particular BaAlxSi 2 -xHx, and choice of active metal. BaGa 2 H 2 and SrGa 2 H 2, two hydrides isostructural with SrAl 2 H 2, were synthesized from its precursors BaGa 2 and SrGa 2. In addition three ternary hydrides BaAlSiH, CaAlSiH and SrAlSiH were manufactured from their related AeAlSi precursors. All powders were characterized by neutron and x-ray diffraction methods. An increased stability towards water/moisture compared to ordinary saline hydrides was noticed, especially for the ternary hydrides. Heat stability was measured with DSC (differential scanning calorimetry). The hydrides BaGa 2 H 2 and SrGa 2 H 2 decompose around 300 oC at 1 atm. This is similar to isostructural SrAl 2 H 2. The ternary hydrides BaAlSiH and SrAlSiH decompose at 600 oC, at 1 atm, which is the highest noticed temperature for compounds with Al-H bonds. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments showed that these hydrides Al-H and Sr-H bonds are really weak, even weaker then the Al-H interactions in <b>alanates</b> and alanes. These hydrides are probably stabilized be their lattices. The electric properties among the ternary hydrides were measured with IR-spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance). The ternary hydrides, AeAlSiH, are indirect semi conductors. BaGa 2 H 2 and SrGa 2 H 2 are conductors.

These materials have nearly ideal equilibrium thermodynamics, good packing densities, moderate volume expansion and useful sintering properties.

Our work has focused on finding solutions to these problems to achieve the performance requirements needed to supply onboard hydrogen for PEM fuel cell powered vehicles. Two new generations of materials have been developed.

To improve capacity we have investigated the use of Ti-halides other than TiCl 3 to catalyze hydrogen absorption and desorption in NaAlH 4. TiF 3 and TiCl 2 appear to work equally as well as TiCl 3 and reduce the overall capacity loss due to the formation of NaCl or NaF.

Regardless of the hydride systems, the morphologies of milled Mg-H, Mg-Al-H and Mg-B-H powders after a prolonged milling time can be characterized by dramatic particle size refinement and high tendency to form agglomerates. In the Mg-Al-H system, no successful synthesis of magnesium <b>alanate</b> has been achieved by MCS of the nanostructured magnesium <b>alanate</b> using four starting stoichiometric Mg- 2 Al mixtures. It is hypothesized that Al(Mg) solid solution in the initial stage (~ 10 h) of CRMA and free Al(s) decomposed from solid solution as the milling time increases the initial stage inhibit the reaction to form magnesium <b>alanate.</b> In contrast to an unsuccessful synthesis in MCS process, a successful synthesis of the magnesium <b>alanate</b> and 2 NaCl mixture by MCAS has been achieved. DSC and TGA analysis show that the decomposition of magnesium <b>alanate</b> occurs in a two-step reaction at the temperature ranges of 125 - 180 and 225 - 340 °C. In the Mg-B-H system, when the Mg- 2 B mixture is made with the oxidized amorphous boron containing B 2 O 3 then after a prolonged MCS time (200 h), only nanometric γ- and β- magnesium hydrides are formed. In contrast, oxide-free amorphous boron in the original Mg- 2 B mixture prompts {{the formation of a}} resulting mixture of nanometric MgB 2 and an amorphous phase containing hydrogen. Further annealing of the milled Mg- 2 B mixtures at ~ 100 - 400 ºC under ~ 4 - 4. 3 MPa of hydrogen for 20 - 100 h does not result in the formation of ternary magnesium <b>alanate.</b> Alternatively, a powder mixture of 2 NaBH 4 and MgCl 2 is used as a starting material to synthesize Mg(BH 4) 2 hydride. Amorphous Mg(BH 4) 2 phase might have been synthesized after MCAS process. However, the formation of Na(Mg) BH 4 solid solution might prevent the synthesis of a large amount of Mg(BH 4) 2 hydride.

This process has been investigated via experiments and simulations due to its potential relevance in the H release mechanism in sodium <b>alanates,</b> prototypical materials for solid state hydrogen storage. Previous computational studies, which used density functional methods for the electronic structure, were restricted to a classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We show that, although they do not change the qualitative picture of the process, nuclear quantum effects reduce the free energy barrier height by about 18 % {{with respect to the}} classical calculation improving agreement with available neutron scattering data...|$|R
