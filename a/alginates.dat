25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium <b>alginates</b> form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E

25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using <b>alginates</b> to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E
2500|$|Polyelectrolytes {{have many}} applications, mostly related to modifying flow and {{stability}} properties of aqueous solutions and gels. For instance, {{they can be}} used to destabilize a colloidal suspension and to initiate flocculation (precipitation). They {{can also be used to}} impart a surface charge to neutral particles, enabling them to be dispersed in aqueous solution. They are thus often used as thickeners, emulsifiers, conditioners, clarifying agents, and even drag reducers. They are used in water treatment and for oil recovery. Many soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics incorporate polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, they are added to many foods and to concrete mixtures (superplasticizer). Some of the polyelectrolytes that appear on food labels are pectin, carrageenan, <b>alginates,</b> and carboxymethyl cellulose. All but the last [...] are of natural origin.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is obtaining and characterizing hydrogels based on {{different}} ratios of oxidized <b>alginate</b> (oA) and k-carrageenan (C), chemically cross-linked with adipic dihydrazide (adh). The <b>alginate</b> (A) was first oxidized with sodium metaperiodate in order to transform it into the dialdehyde derivative, a more reactive compound than <b>alginate.</b> A known procedure for oxidation of <b>alginate</b> with sodium metaperiodate in ethanol-water in order to improve <b>alginate</b> reactivity by transforming the hydroxyl end-groups into dialdehyde was used, preceded by a partially cleavage of the <b>alginate</b> chains.

40|$|Mucoid {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce a viscous {{exopolysaccharide}} called <b>alginate</b> and also express <b>alginate</b> lyase activity which can degrade this polymer. By transposon mutagenesis and gene replacement techniques, the algL gene encoding a P. aeruginosa <b>alginate</b> lyase enzyme {{was found to}} reside between algG and algA within the <b>alginate</b> biosynthetic gene cluster at 35 min on the P. aeruginosa chromosome. DNA sequencing data for algL predicted a protein product of ca. 41 kDa, including a 27 -amino-acid signal sequence, which {{would be consistent with}} its possible localization in the periplasmic space. Expression of the algL gene in Escherichia coli cells resulted in the expression of <b>alginate</b> lyase activity and the appearance of a new protein of ca. 39 kDa detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In mucoid P. aeruginosa strains, expression of algL was regulated by AlgB, which also controls expression of other genes within the <b>alginate</b> gene cluster.

40|$|Oxidation {{reactions}} of <b>alginate</b> solution with H(2) O(2) were performed under different conditions to prepare {{low molecular weight}} <b>alginate,</b> and its potential application for tissue engineering was investigated. H(2) O(2) oxidation is an effective method for <b>alginate</b> depolymerization with the rate depending on reaction time, temperature, solution pH and H(2) O(2) concentration. The structure analyses by FT-IR, elemental analysis and (13) C NMR indicated that, the rupture of glucoside bonds in <b>alginate</b> chains into low molecular weight polymers is the basic process during H(2) O(2) depolymerization. Oxidation of <b>alginate</b> under weak oxidation conditions (H(2) O(2) 0. 6 % (w/v), 50 degrees C, 1 h) did not significantly interfere {{in the formation of}} ionic junctions with calcium ions. The cross-linked <b>alginate</b> scaffold prepared from the obtained <b>alginate</b> under these conditions showed faster degradation rate than that from the unmodified <b>alginate,</b> due to the lower molecular weight of oxidized <b>alginate</b> and the formed aldehyde groups susceptible to hydrolysis.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{produces}} {{increased levels}} of <b>alginate</b> in response to oxygen-deprived conditions. The regulatory pathway(s) that links oxygen limitation to increased synthesis of <b>alginate</b> has remained elusive. In the present study, using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that anaerobiosis-induced <b>alginate</b> production by planktonic PAO 1 requires the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) SadC, previously identified as a regulator of surface-associated lifestyles. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} gene products of PA 4330 and PA 4331, located in a predicted operon with sadC, {{have a major impact on}} <b>alginate</b> production: deletion of PA 4330 (odaA, for oxygen-dependent <b>alginate</b> synthesis activator) caused an <b>alginate</b> production defect under anaerobic conditions, whereas a PA 4331 (odaI, for oxygen-dependent <b>alginate</b> synthesis inhibitor) deletion mutant produced <b>alginate</b> also in the presence of oxygen, which would normally inhibit <b>alginate</b> synthesis. Based on their sequence, OdaA and OdaI have predicted hydratase and dioxygenase reductase activities, respectively. Enzymatic assays using purified protein showed that unlike OdaA, which did not significantly affect DGC activity of SadC, OdaI inhibited c-di-GMP production by SadC. Our data indicate that SadC, OdaA and OdaI are components of a novel response pathway of P. aeruginosa that regulates <b>alginate</b> synthesis in an oxygen-dependent manner...|$|R

The decrease in the DTSvalue with increasing <b>alginate</b> concentration is due to the higher viscosity at higher <b>alginate</b> concentration and thus limited the amount of <b>alginate</b> being penetrate into the HAp block...|$|R
40|$|Background This work investigates {{a general}} method for {{producing}} <b>alginate</b> gel matrices using an internal mode of gelation that depends solely on soluble <b>alginate</b> and alginate/gelling ion particles. The method involves {{the formulation of}} two-component kits comprised of soluble <b>alginate</b> and insoluble alginate/gelling ion particles. Gelling kinetics, elastic and Young’s moduli were investigated for selected parameters with regard to soluble <b>alginate</b> guluronate content, molecular weight, calcium or strontium gelling ions and <b>alginate</b> gelling ion particle sizes in the range between 25 and 125 micrometers. Results By mixing the two components and varying the parameters mentioned above, <b>alginate</b> gel matrices with tailor-made viscoelastic properties and gelling kinetics were obtained. Final gel elasticity depended on <b>alginate</b> type, concentration and gelling ion. The gelling rate could be manipulated, e. g. through selection of the <b>alginate</b> type and molecular weight, particle sizes and the concentration of non-gelling ions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cytotoxicity}} and anti-influenza virus (IFV) {{activity of}} calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> fibers were investigated {{to explore the}} feasibility {{of them to be}} used as biomaterials. African Green Monkey kidney cell (Vero) and human cervical cancer cell (Hela) cultured with <b>alginate</b> fibres were used to screen cytotoxic effects. After 48 h, MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazol) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H tetrazolium bromide) assays were performed. Then cytotoxicity was evaluated with six grades according to cell relative growth rate (RGR). In anti-IFV activity assay, IFV were added to all fibers and the Vero cell survival were detected by MTT assays with calculating the percentage of protection. The cytotoxity of calcium <b>alginate</b> fibers on Vero were grade 0 or 1 in contrast to zinc <b>alginate</b> fibers which was grade 0. The cytotoxity of calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> fibers on Hela were grade 0. Furthermore, partial calcium or zinc <b>alginate</b> fibers could promote Vero or Hela cell growth. In antiviral assay the highest percentage of protection of calcium <b>alginate</b> fibers was 34. 42 %, while that of zinc <b>alginate</b> fibers was 59. 42 %.

50|$|Alginate is {{not free}} from all criticism. Some {{researchers}} believe that <b>alginates</b> with high-M content could produce an inflammatory response and an abnormal cell growth while some have demonstrated that alginate with high-G content lead to an even higher cell overgrowth and inflammatory reaction in vivo as compared to intermediate-G alginates.Even ultrapure <b>alginates</b> may contain endotoxins, and polyphenols which could compromise the biocompatibility of the resultant cell microcapsules. It {{has been shown that}} even though purification processes successfully lower endotoxin and polyphenol content in the processed alginate, it is difficult to lower the protein content and the purification processes could in turn modify the properties of the biomaterial. Thus it is essential that an effective purification process is designed so as to remove all the contaminants from alginate before it can be successfully used in clinical applications.|$|E
