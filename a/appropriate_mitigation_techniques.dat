30|$|The {{demand for}} reliable, fast, and {{low-cost}} data communications services {{for all types}} of wireless applications and environments has increased rapidly in the last few years. Often, different types of wireless networks coexist in the same area and share the communications channel. In such situations, if <b>appropriate</b> <b>mitigation</b> <b>techniques</b> are not applied, wireless signals coming from different sources could interfere with each other causing a considerable degradation in system performance. The coexistence scenario analyzed in this work corresponds to the case of a single ultra wideband (UWB) transmitter operating at the same frequency band as a WiMAX receiver. UWB technology is established as a viable candidate for future wireless personal area networks (WPANs) that require the processing of information with low-power sources at very high speeds across short distances (order of 10 [*]m) [1]. Alternatively, WiMAX systems, which are derived from the IEEE 802.16 air interface standards [2, 3], allow for high-speed broadband connectivity in cellular point-to-multipoint wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN) of wider range (order of 5 [*]Km).|$|E

There is a need of continuous evaluation of the security of a network and enhancement of the network attack detection system, which will be able to detect different attacks along with the characteristics of the attacks. In previous work, the port scan attack is considered as precursors to an attack and the target was to provide the <b>mitigation</b> <b>technique</b> for the particular port scan attack. There have been relatively few empirical studies done for port scan related attacks and those that do exist may no longer reflect the impact of such attacks on the functionalities of the UTM/network device and on the network.

However, {{the most important}} tasks for a comprehensive CBM analysis are to identify the actual root cause that contributes to equipment failure and the selection of <b>appropriate</b> <b>mitigation</b> <b>techniques</b> to address {{the root cause of}} the failure. In this paper, CBM actual site data of a 33 kV switchgear from an electrical utility company in Malaysia (from 2007 to 2010) were used to develop failure root causes database. The database was used to identify the possible root cause of a failure and to propose a failure mitigation plan for any CBM activity. The CBM data were obtained using ultrasound, thermoscanning and transient earth voltage (TEV) methods at different compartments of the switchgear, which yielded specific root causes of failure. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was tested using actual site data obtained in 2011. Using the proposed method, the actual root cause of a failure can be identified quickly; hence the time and cost of repairs can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{challenges}} of harmonic and transient measurements in wind farms {{are described in}} this paper. It is shown that appropriate measurements of harmonic and transient phenomena in offshore wind farms are essential for data analysis and model creation/validation of components or subsystems. The GPS synchronization, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and interference (EMI) challenges during the development, construction, testing and installation of a measurement system for multi-point, high-speed and long-term data logging is described in this paper. The presented measurement system was tested in a rough offshore environment at Avedøre Holme and Gunfleet Sands offshore wind farms. The paper will describe the application of GPS technology in synchronised measurements carried out at Avedøre Holme and Gunfleet Sands wind farms. Different aspects of software development and hardware configuration in order to optimise measurement systems reliability during offshore measurements will be presented. Also real-life examples of results from both offshore measurement campaigns will be described. Some limitations, improvements and results of the measurement system will be explained from both harmonic and transient measurements.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} various factors of overhead high-voltage/broadband over powerlines (HV/BPL) networks {{on the performance of}} the broadband over powerlines-enhanced network model (BPLeNM). BPLeNM is a suitable network model that efficiently describes the delivery of the generated data for monitoring and surveillance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) of overhead HV power grids to the substations. The contribu-tion of this paper is three-fold. First, the performance of BPLeNM is first investigated for a number of BPL factors, such as the topology characteristics of overhead HV/BPL networks, the coupling scheme that injects the BPL signal into overhead HV lines, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) limits that regulate the overhead HV/BPL network operation and the noise characteristics. Second, the performance and the feasibility of B-PLeNM is assessed using the maximum delay time metric, which is the maximum time for the data of the sensors to arrive at the control center, and the recently proposed metric of feasibility probability (FP), which is a macroscopic metric that estimates how much prac-tical and economically feasible is the selection of a network model. Third, an <b>appropriate</b> <b>mitigation</b> <b>technique</b> that applies flexible EMI limits when different noise conditions occur is proposed so that BPLeNM performance differences due to different BPL conditions can be counteracted. The main conclusion of this paper is that BPLeNM defines a powerful, convenient and schedulable network model for todays and futures overhead HV grids in the smart grid (SG) and Internet of Things (IoT) landscape even if different scenarios concerning the operation of underlaid overhead HV/BPL networks occur...|$|R

Of all the traffic noise sources, tire-pavement noise, which is emitted {{as a result of the}} interaction of rolling, slipping, or dragging tires and the pavement surface, is the dominant contributor of overall noise, particularly when vehicles are moving at higher speeds. Therefore, a number of research studies have been conducted to identify and analyze the factors affecting the generation of tire-pavement interaction noise. This helps in identifying and selecting <b>appropriate</b> noise <b>mitigation</b> <b>techniques.</b> In this paper, an extensive literature survey on the factors affecting tire-pavement noise is presented, and different views on the impact of each individual factor are discussed.

40|$|Abstract — PQ {{issues are}} very much {{important}} for utilities, customers and end users and {{it is essential to}} be known by the concerned authorities and users for reduction of economic losses due to the poor PQ. The cost of poor PQ is high and rising. The paper gives insights on global economical losses due to poor PQ. The business risk posed by PQ problems is a real one with even ‘low tech ’ industries exposed to serious financial losses. The global economic meltdown is not the only factor that is pulling down the revenues of Asian countries. A study released said Indian industries lost more than $ 9. 6 billion in 2008 - 09 due to power outages. According to 2008 reports, poor power quality costs European business more than 150 billion dollars a year. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on different power quality related problems as experienced by customers in different countries are highlighted. Summary of PQ costs are given. As the consequence of poor PQ might have large financial impacts on a country’s economy, more initiatives are expected from the concerned parties and regulating bodies to take corrective measures for maintaining better power quality from utility and at end users. Smart grid requires intelligent PQ monitoring to solve different PQ related problems.

40|$|The {{negative}} impact of power quality problem due to voltage flicker has gained a growing concern from utilities, especially {{in the areas of}} distribution planning. This has brought the importance for the utility, manufacturer and end user to identify who is the responsible for causing flicker before any <b>appropriate</b> <b>mitigation</b> <b>techniques</b> is applied. Thus, this research has proposed a new controller for 6 -pulse D-STATCOM based on Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) controller with Hysteresis Current Control (HCC) switching to mitigate voltage flicker in power system. This technique has employed two different control strategies which are PLL control loop and Direct Current (DC) voltage control loop. The first control loop is based on the extraction of the three phase voltage flicker at point of common coupling (PCC) to generate a proper phase angle for source current. Meanwhile, the second control loop is used to determine the amplitude for source current. The outputs from both controllers are multiplied in order to produce reference signals for source current that will be used for Hysteresis Current Control (HCC) switching purpose. It is demonstrated that, the linearity that exists in this proposed controller not only allow the fast detection time but also has a capability to mitigate voltage flicker at different frequencies. Besides that, the extraction of voltage flicker at PCC without using any transformation are able to reduce computations complexity and hence capable to extract the flicker at PCC efficiently. In addition, the flicker source identification based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) demodulation technique also has been proposed in this study. The FFT has been incorporated with Flicker Power Algorithm (FPA) to extract flicker component. It is thus allow FPA to calculate the exact flicker component and hence identify the flicker source location in both radial and non-radial power system. In this study, it is found that the proposed new control algorithm for D-STATCOM based on PLL controller together with HCC switching has been able to produce a better result as compared to the previous techniques in term of time response. Moreover, the integration of FFT with FPA techniques capable to identify the flicker source location in both radial and non-radial power system...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{information}} society, it {{is increasingly}} important to ensure ubiquitous access to broadband services on a global scale. Remote locations, such as sparsely inhabited areas or remote travel paths (by airplanes, ships etc.) can be covered most efficiently by broadband satellite communication systems. As the satellite transmissions at frequencies below 15 GHz are becoming congested, {{it will be necessary}} to use higher frequency bands to provide wide range of broadband communication services. However, signal transmission at Ka and Q/V bands is more sensitive to atmospheric impairments, especially to attenuation due to rain, which severely affect link availability. This calls for real-time estimation and possibly short- term prediction of such impairments, so that they can be counteracted by <b>appropriate</b> <b>mitigation</b> <b>techniques.</b> In order to enable the design of advanced fade mitigation techniques over a wide satellite coverage area, a multidimensional channel modelling is required (i. e. joint distributions of propagation parameters in space, time and frequency). For improved accuracy and geographical expansion of the model, a coordinated set of measurements is required on a wide scale, comprising several measurement locations. To achieve this goal, various actions have to be taken at different levels, i. e. organization and coordination among various sites, development of efficient common software procedures for data processing etc. A project has been initiated by ESA to design a common ground propagation terminal, meeting scientific and budgetary requirements and enabling comparable observations [1] which is intended to be used in the Alphasat mission, carrying Q/V-band payload (denoted as TDP# 5 – Technology Demonstration Payload 5) [2]. At the level of software design, actions are being taken towards the development of a common data processing tool. At previous COST meeting, an example of such a tool has been presented [3]. The goal is to obtain a software package, which will embrace the state of the art procedures for processing the measured data, thus increasing the reliability of obtained statistical data, while its usage has to remain user friendly, possibly by increasing the application of standalone automatic procedures. In this paper, an implementation of efficient procedure for detecting scattering effects is presented. Such a procedure is required in order to adequately combine beacon receiver and radiometer measured data. The proposed procedure is based on searching for linear and nonlinear part of the brightness temperatures scatter plot. In comparison to previous methods, the advantages of the proposed procedure are increased accuracy of obtained statistical data, its automatic adaptability to various conditions of the environment (e. g. different climate zones) and its simple usage, which requires minimal user interaction. The work has been conducted mainly at ONERA, in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, CNES, ESA and Jozef Stefan Institute...|$|E

40|$|Proton {{therapy with}} active {{scanning}} beam delivery has significant advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, {{so far only}} static targets have been treated in this way, since moving targets potentially lead to interplay effects. For 4 D treatment planning, information on the target motion is needed to calculate time-resolved dose distributions. In this study, respiratory liver motion has been extracted from 4 D CT data using two deformable image registration algorithms. In moderately moving patient cases (mean motion range around 6 mm), the registration error {{was no more than}} 3 mm, while it reached 7 mm for larger motions (range around 13 mm). The obtained deformation fields have then been used to calculate different time-resolved 4 D treatment plans. Averaged over both motion estimations, interplay effects can increase the D₅-D₉₅ value for the clinical target volume (CTV) from 8. 8 % in a static plan to 23. 4 % when motion is considered. It has also been found that the different deformable registration algorithms can provide different motion estimations despite performing similarly for the selected landmarks, which in turn can lead to differing 4 D dose distributions. Especially for single-field treatments where no motion mitigation is used, a maximum (mean) dose difference (averaged over three cases) of 32. 8 % (2. 9 %) can be observed. However, this registration ambiguity-induced uncertainty can be reduced if rescanning is applied or if the treatment plan consists of multiple fields, where the maximum (mean) difference can decrease to 15. 2 % (0. 57 %). Our results indicate the necessity to interpret 4 D dose distributions for scanned proton therapy with some caution or with error bars to reflect the uncertainties resulting from the motion estimation.

Look-up tables for mitigation of SISO (single carrier) systems appeared in satellite [2] and in its terrestrial counterpart [11]. However, MIMO (multicarrier) LUTs are still in early stages of research [17]. In general, MIMO LUTs have large amount of entries, which make their population cumbersome and increase their computational resources compared to SISO LUTs [18].
