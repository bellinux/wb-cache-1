40|$|The three body (triple dipole) {{interaction}} of Axilrod, Teller and Muto (ATM) contributes 5 to 10 % {{of the total}} energy of condensed phases of inert elements. It is shown in this paper for clusters and films that a much larger or smaller <b>ATM</b> <b>contribution</b> can arise for other geometries or other atomic species. The ratio R of the three body interaction energy to the two body energy is evaluated {{for a wide variety}} of configurations. This ratio varies considerably with the geometry. For highly polarizable atoms in certain geometries, the magnitude of the three body energy is comparable to that of the two body energy and can be either attractive or repulsive. Systematic trends are established and explained. Comment: Changed format to include figures in same fil...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} a {{comprehensive}} research program for developing techniques {{for improving the}} performance of Internet protocols over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based satellite networks. Among the service categories provided by ATM networks, {{the most commonly used}} category for data traffic is the unspecified bit rate (UBR) service. UBR allows sources to send data into the network without any feedback control. The project resulted in the numerous <b>ATM</b> Forum <b>contributions</b> and papers...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{extends the}} Outside Nodal Hierarchy List (ONHL) procedures described in <b>ATM</b> Form <b>Contribution</b> 97 - 0766. These extensions allow multiple mobile networks to form either {{an ad hoc}} network or an extension of a fixed PNNI infrastructure. This contribution covers the simplest case where the top-most Logical Group Nodes (LGNs), in those mobile networks, all reside {{at the same level}} in a PNNI hierarchy. Future contributions will cover the general case where those top-most LGNs reside at different hierarchy levels. This contribution considers a flat ad hoc network architecture [...] in the sense that each mobile network always participates in the PNNI hierarchy at the preconfigured level of its top-most LGN...|$|R
40|$|The oxygen {{reduction}} reaction (ORR) was {{studied by}} Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for Nd 2 NiO 4 +δ (NNO) electrodes deposited on La 0. 9 Sr 0. 1 Ga 0. 8 Mg 0. 2 O 2. 85 (LSGM) electrolyte. The influence of NNO microstructure on the electrochemical performance was evaluated. The EIS measurements {{were carried out}} {{as a function of}} temperature (500 <T< 750 ºC) and oxygen partial pressure (10 - 4 <pO 2 < 1 <b>atm).</b> Three <b>contributions</b> associated with the ORR were identified: at high (HF), medium (MF) and low frequencies (LF). The HF contribution was associated with oxygen ion transfer trough electrode/electrolyte interphase. The MF contribution was attributed to oxygen ions diffusion within the NNO. The LF contribution was related to O 2 -dissociative adsorption for NNO obtained by chemical routes, where the particle sizes are smaller. If NNO were obtained by Solid State Reaction, the LF element was associated with a convolution of dissociative adsorption and gas diffusion processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} {{bit rate}} (ABR) {{service has been}} developed to support data traffic over ATM networks and provide endto -end congestion control at the ATM layer. However, as most data applications today are only connected to ATM via legacy networks, simulation results in recent <b>ATM</b> Forum <b>contributions</b> suggest that ABR may still cause congestion at network interfaces and cannot provide adequate flow control on an end-to-end basis between data sources. In this paper, we propose a new efficient scheme for regulating TCP traffic over ATM networks {{with the goal of}} minimizing the network-interface buffer requirement. The key idea underlying our scheme is to match the TCP source rate to the ABR explicit rate by controlling the flow of TCP acknowledgments at network interfaces. We present analytical and simulation results to show that our scheme has minimum buffer requirement, yet offers the same throughput performance as that with infinite buffer. Moreover, our scheme is transparent to the TCP la [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Air Transportation Management (ATM) Workshop {{was held}} 31 Jan. - 1 Feb. 1995 at NASA Ames Research Center. The {{purpose of the}} {{workshop}} was to develop an initial understanding of user concerns and requirements for future ATM capabilities and to initiate discussions of alternative means and technologies for achieving more effective ATM capabilities. The topics for the sessions were as follows: viewpoints of future ATM capabilities, user requirements, lessons learned, and technologies for ATM. In addition, two panel sessions discussed priorities for <b>ATM,</b> and potential <b>contributions</b> of NASA to ATM. The proceedings contain transcriptions of all sessions...|$|R
40|$|Groundwaters hosted within {{unconfined}} aquifers {{were collected}} from sixty-five cold and slightly thermal springs and wells. The studied aquifers are mainly constituted of a thick sequence of carbonates, Meso-Cenozoic in age. Basic volcanic intercalations, occurring during several episodes, are also present. Except for the samples located near the coast where seawater contribution plays an important role, the chemical composition of studied groundwaters is controlled by water-rock interaction. The proposed geochemical mass balance model suggests that Ca+Mg/HCO 3 groundwaters evolve toward a Na-HCO 3 type due to interaction with volcanic rocks, thus forming secondary minerals. pCO 2 values up to 0. 1 <b>atm</b> suggest a <b>contribution</b> of a CO 2 -gas source. The  13 CTDIC values range between – 15 to - 8 ‰ vs PDB, indicating mixed organic-inorganic carbon sources...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} gives a {{brief overview}} of technical issues related to use of Integrated PNNI (I-PNNI) as a routing protocol for support of the Internetwork Protocol (IP). This implies that PNNI would support routing for both ATM and IP simultaneously in an IP over <b>ATM</b> environment. This <b>contribution</b> is intended to generate discussion and an initial consideration of issues. This contribution does not attempt to present a complete discussion of all issues. It is understood that further refinement and completion of details of the protocol will occur during the process of standardization of Integrated PNNI. It is expected that some of the details presented in this contribution will change during the process of standardization of integrated PNNI. Support for other Internetwork Layer Protocols (such as ATM Forum / 96 - 0355 2 Appletalk, APPN/HPR, CLNP, DECnet, IPv 6, and IPX) is for further study. It is felt that progress on integrated PNNI will be more straightforward if we first define s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Oxides of {{nitrogen}} (NOx) have considerable environmental impact while the methylidyne radical (CH) plays {{a crucial role}} in basic kinetic processes leading to nitric oxide (NO) formation in flames. Implementation of complicated CFD codes in the design of future gas-turbine combustors mandates development of reduced kinetic models for NO under partially premixed conditions to enable reasonably accurate predictions of NOx emissions. ^ For these reasons, we report in this work quantitative spatially-resolved, quenching-corrected LIF measurements of NO and CH concentrations in laminar, counter-flow partially premixed and non-premixed flames at pressures up to 15 atm. Three partially premixed (2 ̆ 6 phis;B = 1. 45, 1. 6 and 2. 0) methane-air flames and a single non-premixed methane-air flame are investigated at a global strain rate of 20 s− 1. Excitation occurs at 226. 03 nm for NO and at 431. 5 nm for CH in their corresponding A-X (0, 0) systems. Fluorescence is monitored in a 3 -nm window centered at 236 nm in the A-X (0, 1) band for NO and in a 10 -nm window centered at 430 nm in the A-X (0, 0) band for CH. The LIF signals are quantified by using calibration factors determined by seeding pure nitric oxide (for NO) and by employing cavity ring-down spectroscopy (for CH) in flames at 1 atm. Computed spectral overlap fractions for the chosen transitions are utilized to transport atmospheric calibration factors to higher pressures. ^ The LIF measurements are investigated primarily by using pathway and sensitivity analyses with different comprehensive kinetic mechanisms. Spatial locations as well as absolute concentrations of NO and CH are predicted well when using GRI 3. 0 for partially premixed flames throughout the pressure range. These trends are consistent with dominance by the thermal and N 2 O mechanisms in these flames. However, the kinetic mechanisms fail to predict even qualitatively measurements in non-premixed flames between 2 and 5 <b>atm.</b> A significant <b>contribution</b> from prompt NO occurs in these diffusion flames which leads to strong interactions between NO and CH kinetics. Some modifications for critical elementary reactions will be necessary in future efforts so as to match measured LIF data, thus hopefully producing a kinetic scheme which predicts NO concentrations more accurately over a wide range of pressures. ...|$|R
