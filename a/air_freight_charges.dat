40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>freight</b> {{transport}} plays a {{vital role}} in Germany’s foreign trade and contributes to Germany’s position as one of the leading exporting countries worldwide. Although the volume of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> accounts for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> transport forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and time-sensitive goods. However, only relatively little research has been conducted in air transport with regard to the spatial differentiated generation and distribution of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> compared to the state of research in passenger transport. The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Building on these findings, the distribution of the regionally generated <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is explored by modelling the airport choice behaviour of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> forwarders using a discrete choice approach. ...|$|R

Therefore, the paper aims to provide new insights into the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand structures in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Applying the concept of the derived transport demand and taking into consideration international trade theories, the paper starts with an analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> affinity and demand of different branches of trade within Germany’s manufacturing sector. Building on these findings, the regional distribution of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand in Germany is investigated. At first, concentration trends of the spatially differentiated <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand on the regional level of the Federal States in Germany are analysed. In a next research step, the paper aims to identify and evaluate the factors determining the regional distribution of the industry-specific <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand. Multiple regression models have been applied to analyse the generation of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand on a disaggregated regional level (the sixteen Federal States in Germany) for fourteen different branches of manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Transport Economics) In the past, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> was {{generally}} {{a by-product of}} passenger orientated airlines {{in the sense that}} excess payload and unsold passenger seats were sold as air cargo space. In recent years, this trend has changed and it is observed that the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> industry is increasingly becoming an industry in itself. The individual market share of scheduled international <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> operations within the air transport industry is currently approximately 35, 8 %. In South Africa, compared {{to the rest of the}} world, the historical development of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> has been slower and confined primarily to the one national carrier (South African Airways (SAA)). The purpose of this study is, to firstly, determine the potential for growth in the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> market within and outside South Africa. Secondly, to isolate and describe the factors within SAA which are sub-optimal and therefore have a negative impact on the development of the full potential of the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> services of the carrier. The overall conclusion of the study is that the market for <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> within and outside of South Africa can be expanded significantly. This conclusion is dependent on the positioning and equipping of the freight division of SAA independently from passenger services, together with the provision of specialist knowledge and systems required for effective <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> management...|$|R

40|$|Meyer, WilliamMiller, MarkThe {{research}} question this dissertation attempts to answer is whether <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is {{significantly associated with}} population growth; or the income and employment of people in cities; or green geographic spaces. I hypothesize that air cargo throughput is positively associated with these four variables. After appraising the literature on cities, world cities, and world-city networks, as well as establishing the link between airports and cities, I utilize two methods to test my hypotheses. First, I compare two cities – Detroit and Doha – which initially experienced economic and demographic growth before going on opposite developmental trajectories, using the most different systems design [MDSD]. Second, I employ multiple linear regression to test my hypothesis. The results indicate that 1) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> has a positive association with green area in cities without seaports; 2) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> is significantly associated with urban employment in cities with seaports; and 3) <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> results in population growth in cities with seaports. ☐ Keywords: Cities, International Relations, capitalist world-economy, uneven development, global commodity chains, <b>air</b> <b>freight,</b> airports, airport citiesUniversity of Delaware, Department ofPh.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the Asian, European, North American and Middle East <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> networks of combination passenger and freight and all-freight carriers using <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> capacity datasets {{for the period}} 1999 - 2009. The chapter begins by reviewing {{some of the key}} trends that have shaped and characterised <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> markets during the 1990 s and 2000 s. The impact of air transport market liberalisation is identified as a key determinant of changing carrier behaviour, particularly in relation to network structure organisation. The second major section of the chapter {{examines the}} sources of data available for tracking trends in the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> sector. The lack of comprehensive datasets detailing the activities of the integrated carriers is discussed. Using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) historical databases that list ex-post carrier schedules for each year globally, annual data series indicating freight capacity of all Asian, European and North American and selected Middle Eastern carriers are determined and the general trends are described. The US T- 100 Database is used to derive an equivalent distribution for the two largest integrated carriers, FedEx and UPS. The changing nature of industry organisation is discussed and the key players in each region are distinguished. For the combination carriers, passenger and freight network structures are compared for the period 1999 - 2009. The fortunes of the key <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> hubs are reviewed over the same period. The chapter concludes with a discussion about the key driving factors in dictating the future direction of the industry in the coming decade.
