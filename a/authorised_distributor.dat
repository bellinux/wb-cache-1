The certified value for KV is an estimate of the mean value of the whole batch. The obtained values are shown in the table below. The associated uncertainties are standard uncertainties corresponding to a confidence level of about 68 %. The certified value is traceable to the International System of Units (SI).

To improve comparability, an internationally accepted plasmid certified reference material (CRM) was developed according to ISO Guide 34 : 2009. Fragments of BCR-ABL 1 (e 14 a 2 mRNA fusion), BCR and GUSB transcripts were amplified and cloned into pUC 18 to yield plasmid pIRMM 0099. Six different linearised plasmid solutions were produced with the following copy number concentrations, assigned by digital PCR, and expanded uncertainties: 1. 08 +/- 0. 13 x 10 (6), 1. 08 +/- 0. 11 x 10 (5), 1. 03 +/- 0. 10 x 10 (4), 1. 02 +/- 0. 09 x 10 (3), 1. 04 +/- 0. 10 x 10 (2) and 10. 0 +/- 1. 5 copies/mu l. The certification of the material for the number of specific DNA fragments per plasmid, copy number concentration of the plasmid solutions and the assessment of inter-unit heterogeneity and stability were performed according to ISO Guide 35 : 2006. Two suitability studies performed by 63 BCR-ABL 1 testing laboratories demonstrated that this set of 6 plasmid CRMs can help to standardise a number of measured transcripts of e 14 a 2 BCR-ABL 1 and three control genes (ABL 1, BCR and GUSB).

50|$|Since 1932 the {{products}} of the Companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and of The British Petroleum Group have been marketed in the UK through the agency of Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. In that year the company's business amounted to about 3 million tons, out of a total UK market of some 7 million tons.The activities of this most successful enterprise have extended greatly over the years. In 1970 Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. supplied 40 million tons of the UK petroleum market, amounting to a total of 100 million tons.In the majority of countries outside the UK. Shell and BP have always each marketed their products through their own entirely separate organisations and it has been decided that Shell and BP marketing operations in the UK should now be brought more into line with this pattern over the next 4-5 years.Since 1966 the Shell and the BP Service Station networks have been managed by separate sales organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. It is now proposed to extend this 'brand streaming' progressively to cover all products and all market sectors. This will ultimately lead to the establishment of two viable marketing organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. thus facilitating the termination of the agency agreement.The National Benzole Company will continue to trade under the National brand and will form part of the BP marketing organisation.The Supply, Storage and Delivery functions, and the Computer and other services, will be the object of further detailed study once brand streaming of direct trade is substantially complete and a plan for the treatment of <b>Authorised</b> <b>Distributors</b> is agreed. Should it be decided that these functions should continue for a period after the transfer of the sales activities, then these will continue to be carried out by Shell-Mex and B.P.The employees of Shell-Mex and B.P. will be redeployed within the separate marketing organisations and redundancies will not arise {{as a result of this}} re-organisation.|$|R
