40|$|As ASTROD I {{travels through}} space, its test mass will <b>accrue</b> <b>charge</b> due to galactic cosmic-rays and solar {{energetic}} particles incident on the spacecraft. This test mass charge {{will result in}} Coulomb forces between the test mass and the surrounding electrodes. In earlier work using the GEANT 4 toolkit, we predicted a net charging rate of nearly 9. 0 +e/s from cosmic-ray protons between 0. 1 and 1000 GeV at solar maximum, and rising to 26. 5 +e/s at solar minimum. Here we use GEANT 4 to simulate the charging process due to solar energetic particle events and to estimate the magnitude of acceleration noise due to this charging. The predicted charging rates range from 2840 to 64300 +e/s, at peak intensity, for the 4 largest SEP events in September and October 1989. For the 2 larger events, the acceleration disturbances due to charging exceeds the ASTROD I acceleration noise budget requirement. Continuous discharge should be considered for suppressing this charging noise. The acceleration noise during the 2 small events is well below the design target, although during these events, the net charging rate will be dominated by these solar fluxes.

50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly mortgage payment plan and a traditional mortgage payment plan is that instead of making 12 full payments each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly mortgage payment plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one half traditional payments. Finance companies use this pattern to their advantage. Finance companies charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the finance companies to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional <b>accrued</b> interest <b>charges.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) {{comprises the}} continuum of permanent deficits caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which may include brain injury, neurobehavioural impairment, growth restriction, and physical birth defects. Individuals with FASD experience numerous adverse outcomes, including high rates of involvement with the criminal justice system. This dissertation examined the psycholegal abilities, justice-system experiences, and risks associated with prospective offending in 50 youth with FASD. The reliability and predictive validity of three commonly used youth risk assessment tools were also examined. Results were contrasted with a second group of 50 justice-involved youth without prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Participants included 100 justice-involved youth aged 12 to 23. Participants completed a battery of measures including Grisso’s Miranda Instruments, the Understanding Police Interrogation Questionnaire, the Fitness Interview Test-Revised, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence, and the Wide Range Achievement Test- 4 th Ed. Rating scales including the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth, the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory, and the Psychopathy Checklist—Youth Version, were also completed. Youth with FASD demonstrated substantially more impairment in psycholegal abilities relevant to police interrogation and adjudication than participants in the comparison group. Intellectual ability and reading comprehension emerged as robust independent predictors of psycholegal abilities, though the FASD diagnosis also served as an independent predictor of youths’ understanding and communication skills on the FIT-R. The two groups showed many similarities in legal experiences, including high rates of self-reported false confessions. Overall, the two groups demonstrated lengthy and serious offense histories. Youth with FASD showed earlier contact with the justice system and a higher volume of past offending, while comparison youth tended {{to be charged with}} fewer, but more serious offences. Youth with FASD recidivated earlier in the 3 -month follow-up period and <b>accrued</b> more <b>charges.</b> They earned significantly higher continuous scores across risk assessment tools, and substantially more youth in the FASD group were rated as high or very high risk to reoffend. The risk assessment tools performed reasonably well in predicting general recidivism in youth with FASD. These findings are discussed in the context of current legal policy, clinical practice, and future intervention planning...|$|R

40|$|Upon {{entering}} a star system, light sails {{are subject to}} both gravitational forces and radiation pressure, and can use both in concert to modify their trajectory. Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the sail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also.

We find that a 10 m^ 2 sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 μC/g or higher will need {{to take account of}} magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The magnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and allow capture onto closer orbits around a target star. However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change resulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic field lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on well-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at α Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the final destination (Proxima) post-assist.

40|$|Individuals with {{fetal alcohol}} {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) {{are more likely}} to be involved in the criminal justice system than individuals without FASD. Research shows that individuals with FASD are unable to learn from standard methods of punishment, such as incarceration. The objective of this research was to determine how young offenders with an FASD diagnosis differ from young offenders without a diagnosis in order to inform sentencing and treatment options for FASD offenders. Using a pre-existing database of court-referred young offenders, the data of 197 youths were compared. Eighty-six young offenders in this sample were diagnosed with FASD. Information was available on a number of neurocognitive variables, such as cognition, memory, attention, achievement, and language, as well as social data, such as substance use, assistance in school, home stability, and criminal charges. Profile analysis was run on the neurocognitive data for young offenders with and without FASD. The social data were analyzed using a combination of correlation and one-way ANOVAs. Young offenders with FASD differed from young offenders without FASD on severity of impairment on the neurocognitive measures, with individuals with FASD scoring lower that the comparison group. There was no difference in the profile of neurocognitive deficiency between the groups, suggesting that young offenders with FASD have the same profile of impairments as other young offenders but to a more severe degree. There were not found to be any strong or moderate associations between the types of <b>charges</b> <b>accrued</b> and any neurocognitive measure, indicating that deficits likely do not directly lead to offending. Home stability between birth and age seven was particularly important as a protective factor for future crime, and having ever been in foster care was strongly related to number of charges. Current substance use of all kinds was associated with a higher number of charges. Youth with FASD are likely more at risk for criminal behaviour due to lower overall neurocognitive functioning, poor environmental stability, and an interaction of the two. Programs for people with FASD will be required throughout the life span and current correctional programs have yet to be developed for offenders with FASD...|$|R
40|$|The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) {{is searching}} for weakly-interacting massive {{particles}} (WIMPS), which could explain the dark matter problem in cosmology and particle physics. By simultaneously measuring signals from deposited charge and the energy in non-equilibrium phonons created by particle interactions in intrinsic germanium crystals at a temperature of 40 mK, a signature response for each event is produced. This response, combined with phonon pulse-shape information, allows CDMS to actively discriminate candidate WIMP interactions with nuclei from electromagnetic radioactive background which interacts with electrons. The challenges associated with these techniques are unique. Carrier scattering {{is dominated by the}} spontaneous emission of Luke-Neganov phonons due to zero-point fluctuations of the lattice ions. Drift fields are maintained at only a few V/cm, else these emitted phonons would dominate the phonons of the original interaction. The dominant systematic issues with CDMS detectors are due to the effects of space charge accumulation. It has been an open question how space <b>charge</b> <b>accrues,</b> and by which of several potential recombination and ionization processes. In this work, we have simulated the transport of electrons and holes in germanium under CDMS conditions. We have implemented both a traditional Monte Carlo technique based on carrier energy, followed later by a novel Monte Carlo algorithm with scattering rates defined and sampled by vector momentum. This vector-based method provides for a full anisotropic simulation of carrier transport including free-flight acceleration with an anisotropic mass, and anisotropic scattering rates. With knowledge of steady state carrier dynamics as a function of applied field, the results of our Monte Carlo simulations allow us to make a wide variety of predictions for energy dependent processes for both electrons and holes. Such processes include carrier capture by charged impurities, neutral impurities, static dipoles, and capture forming ``anion'' (D-/A+) states. We also generate predictions for impact ionization of shallow impurities and of impact ``neutralization'' of D-/A+ states. We use measurements of carrier capture performed on CDMS detectors to validate a plausible model for electron and hole capture due to neutral shallow impurities and their charged D-/A+ states. This model, along with carrier drift and diffusion parameters from Monte Carlo simulation, can be used as the foundation for simulations of space charge evolution in CDMS detectors, simultaneously solving continuity equations with Poisson's equation...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} {{is important for}} network design and deployment. Resource management and allocation have been studied under {{a wide variety of}} scenarios [...] - routing in wired networks, scheduling in cellular networks, multiplexing, switching, and channel access in opportunistic networks are but a few examples. In this dissertation, we revisit resource management in the context of routing and scheduling in multihop wireless networks and pricing in single resource systems. The first issue addressed is of delays in multihop wireless networks. The resource under contention is capacity which is allocated by a joint routing and scheduling algorithm. Delay in wireless networks is a key issue gaining interest with the growth of interactive applications and proliferation of wireless networks. We start with an investigation of the back-pressure algorithm (BPA), an algorithm that activates the schedule with the largest sum of link weights in a timeslot. Though the BPA is throughput-optimal, it has poor end-to-end delays. Our investigation identifies poor routing decisions at low loads as one cause for it. We improve the delay performance of max-weight algorithms by proposing a general framework for routing and scheduling algorithms that allow directing packets towards the sink node dynamically. For a stationary environment, we explicitly formulate delay minimization as a static problem while maintaining stability. We see similar improved delay performance with the advantage of reduced per time-slot complexity. Next, the issue of pricing for flow based models is studied. The increasing popularity of cloud computing and the ease of commerce over the Internet is making pricing a key issue requiring greater attention. Although pricing has been extensively studied in the context of maximizing revenue and fairness, we take a different perspective and investigate pricing with predictability. Prior work has studied resource allocations that link insensitivity and predictability. In this dissertation, we present a detailed analysis of pricing under insensitive allocations. We study three common pricing models [...] - fixed rate pricing, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, and congestion-based pricing, and provide the expected operator revenue and user payments under them. A pre-payment scheme is also proposed where users pay on arrival a fee for their estimated service costs. Such a mechanism is shown to have lower variability in payments under fixed rate pricing and VCG auctions while generating the same long-term revenue as in a post-payment scheme, where users pay the exact <b>charge</b> <b>accrued</b> during their sojourn. Our formulation and techniques further the understanding of pricing mechanisms and decision-making for the operator...|$|R
