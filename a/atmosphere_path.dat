Improvements made to the setup include a new, more powerful laser, a precision designed turbulence delivery system, an imbedded pressure sensor, and a platform for height adjustability between the laser beam and the turbulence model. The setup was not only able to reproduce previous results exactly but also allowed new data for the turbulence strength Cn 2, the Rytov variance (scintillation) and the coherence diameter (Fried’s parameter) to be successfully measured. Analysis of the produced interferograms has been discussed using fast Fourier transforms. The results confirm, within the Kolmogorov regime, that phase and intensity fluctuations increase relative to temperature. The turbulent region exhibited very strong disturbances, {{in the range of}} 1. 1 × 10 - 12 m- 2 / 3 to 2. 7 × 10 - 12 m- 2 / 3. In spite of the strong turbulence strength, scintillation proved otherwise, since the condition for a weak turbulence environment was determined in the laboratory and a low scintillation index was to be expected. This is {{as a result of the}} relatively short propagation distances achieved in the laboratory.

Therefore to understand atmospheric turbulence effects on vertical FSO communication links such as space-to-ground links, it is necessary to specify Cn 2 profiles along the atmospheric propagation path. To avoid the limitations on the applicability of classical approaches, propagation simulation through geometrical ray tracing is applied. This is achieved by considering the atmosphere along the optical propagation path as a spatial distribution of spherical bubbles with varying relative refractive index deviations representing turbulent eddies. The relative deviations of the refractive index are statistically determined from altitude-dependent and time-varying temperature fluctuations, as measured by a microwave profiling radiometer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the retrievals algorithm {{used to determine}} temperature and height from radiance measurements by the Microwave Limb Sounder on EOS Aura. MLS is a "limbscanning" instrument, meaning that it views the <b>atmosphere</b> along <b>paths</b> that do not intersect the surface - it actually looks forwards from the Aura satellite. This means that the temperature retrievals are for a "profile" of the atmosphere somewhat ahead of the satellite. Because {{of the need to}} view a finite sample of the atmosphere, the sample spans a box about 1. 5 km deep and several tens of kilometers in width; the optical characteristics of the atmosphere mean that the sample is representative of a tube about 200 - 300 km long in the direction of view. The retrievals use temperature analyses from NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS- 5) data assimilation system as a priori states. The temperature retrievals are somewhat deperrde~zt on these a priori states, especially in the lower stratosphere. An important part of the validation of any new dataset involves comparison with other, independent datasets. A large part of this study is concerned with such comparisons, using a number of independent space-based measurements obtained using different techniques, and with meteorological analyses. The MLS temperature data are shown to have biases that vary with height, but also depend on the validation dataset. MLS data are apparently biased slightly cold relative to correlative data in the upper troposphere and slightly warm in the middle stratosphere.

Very high meteor trails were observed with Israeli L-band radars in 1998, 1999 and 2001. Through the Leonid activity, around the latest perihelion passage of comet Tempel-Tuttle, optical meteors as high as 200 km were reported. This was partly due to new and better observing methods.

The ability to measure vertical eddy fluxes of gases from aircraft platforms represents an important capability to obtain spatially resolved data, but represents a unique challenge, when attempting to calibrate the aircraft-instrument combination. The primary calibration challenges involve {{the lack of a}} known “calibration standard” for atmospheric wind and the effects of the aircraft itself upon the local airflow around the flow measurement sensors. ^ The work documented herein consisted of three separate investigations to determine the airborne wind measurement precision of a particular aircraft-instrument combination. Rigorous tests of the particular airflow measurement probe in a wind tunnel were complemented with in-flight calibrations. The effect of airflow distortion around the aircraft’s body on the measured relative airflow was determined through a simple set of in-flight maneuvers and data analysis. A least-squares estimate of the horizontal wind and measurement bias components was developed. These data were compared with an independent model using an internet-based program (called the HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, abbreviated “HYSPLIT”) to compute the wind trajectories in the <b>atmosphere</b> (the <b>path</b> of an air parcel). Estimates of the variability of actual atmospheric wind during an evaluation flight were performed. ^ The precision of the vertical wind measurement for spatial scales larger than approximately 2 m is independent of aircraft flight speed over the range of airspeeds studied and the 1 σ precision is approximately 0. 03 ms - 1. It was estimated, from flight test data, and from variations in aircraft attitude and airspeed in flux-measurement configuration, that the uncertainty in vertical wind measurement caused by varying lift-induced upwash is ∼ 0. 05 m s- 1. The estimated variability of the actual atmospheric wind scaled inversely with airspeed. ...|$|R

We are in a position to compute extinction with accuracy better than 10 pro cents. We are in a position to do it routinely, in a similar way how we update apparent star positions for precession and nutation. Moreover, we are in a position to do it now.

Input data for the tomographic reconstructions are generated by the Earth Parameter and Orbit determination System (EPOS) software of the GFZ, which provides zenith total delay (ZTD), integrated water vapor (IWV) and slant total delay (STD) data operationally with a temporal resolution of 2. 5 min (STD) and 15 min (ZTD, IWV). The water vapor distribution in the atmosphere is derived by tomographic reconstruction techniques. The quality of the solution is dependent on many factors such as the spatial coverage of the <b>atmosphere</b> with slant <b>paths,</b> the spatial distribution of their intersections and the accuracy of the input observations. Independent observations are required to validate the tomographic reconstructions and to get precise information on the accuracy of the derived 3 -D water vapor fields.

The natural system model reproduces measured aqueous solute concentrations in the target water, signifying the model is a close approximation of the natural process. Natural system model {{results suggest that the}} open system achieves steady state within a few decades, while the closed system may take up to 6, 500 years to reach observed fluid compositions.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) {{such as the}} United States 2 ̆ 7 GPS and Europe 2 ̆ 7 s {{upcoming}} Galileo system provide unique signals-of-opportunity for atmospheric sounding. When {{a planetary}} atmosphere occults a radio-frequency (RF) signal, its physical properties cause measurable changes in the signal. Therefore, at any time we can track a GNSS signal that is propagating along a path that intersects the atmosphere, we can measure various properties of the <b>atmosphere</b> along that <b>path.</b> Researchers have successfully demonstrated this radio occultation (RO) technique with GPS signals, and the National Research Council has recommended widespread deployment of RO receivers on future Earth-observing satellites. ^ In the coming years, Europe 2 ̆ 7 s new Galileo navigation system 2 ̆ 7 s deployment will {{double the number of}} GNSS satellites in orbit. An RO receiver that can track both GPS and Galileo signals will be able to observe roughly twice as many RO events, doubling its measurement density in space and time for minimal additional cost. ^ Additionally, open-loop (OL) signal tracking has proven to be an effective method for tracking occulted signals through low altitudes where strong refractivity gradients often overwhelm traditional closed-loop (CL) trackers. The OL method predicts the character of the signal ahead of time and measures the prediction error upon arrival of the actual signal. In contrast, the CL method relies on error feedback to fully characterize the signal in real time. ^ This thesis provides an overview of the Galileo GNSS and its AltBOC-modulated E 5 signal, introduces and compares several AltBOC tracking discriminators and develops two prototype RO receivers for E 5 employing an open-loop signal tracking approach to decrease the minimum altitude at which we can observe RO events. The Galileo constellation does not yet exist, so {{it is not possible to}} test a fully representative RO receiver. To provide initial validation of the E 5 OL tracking algorithms, these prototypes—operating from a fixed location on the ground—track signals from the Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element B (GIOVE-B) test satellite and synthesize aspects of OL tracking that would normally require a full GNSS constellation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} for the work presented in this thesis is to retrieve profile information for the atmospheric trace constituents nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) in the lower troposphere from remote sensing measurements. The remote sensing technique used, referred to as Multiple AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS), is a recent technique that represents a significant advance on the well-established DOAS, especially for what it concerns the study of tropospheric trace consituents. NO 2 is an important trace gas in the lower troposphere {{due to the fact}} that it is involved in the production of tropospheric ozone; ozone and nitrogen dioxide are key factors in determining the quality of air with consequences, for example, on human health and the growth of vegetation. To understand the NO 2 and ozone chemistry in more detail not only the concentrations at ground but also the acquisition of the vertical distribution is necessary. In fact, the budget of nitrogen oxides and ozone in the atmosphere is determined both by local emissions and non-local chemical and dynamical processes (i. e. diffusion and transport at various scales) that greatly impact on their vertical and temporal distribution: thus a tool to resolve the vertical profile information is really important. Useful measurement techniques for atmospheric trace species should fulfill at least two main requirements. First, they must be sufficiently sensitive to detect the species under consideration at their ambient concentration levels. Second, they must be specific, which means that the results of the measurement of a particular species must be neither positively nor negatively influenced by any other trace species simultaneously present in the probed volume of air. Air monitoring by spectroscopic techniques has proven to be a very useful tool to fulfill these desirable requirements as well as a number of other important properties. During the last decades, many such instruments have been developed which are based on the absorption properties of the constituents in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the far infrared to the ultraviolet. Among them, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) has played an important role. DOAS is an established remote sensing technique for atmospheric trace gases probing, which identifies and quantifies the trace gases in the atmosphere taking advantage of their molecular absorption structures in the near UV and visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (from 0. 25 μm to 0. 75 μm). Passive DOAS, in particular, can detect the presence of a trace gas in terms of its integrated concentration over the atmospheric path from the sun to the receiver (the so called slant column density). The receiver can be located at ground, as well as on board an aircraft or a satellite platform. Passive DOAS has, therefore, a flexible measurement configuration that allows multiple applications. The ability to properly interpret passive DOAS measurements of atmospheric constituents depends crucially on how well the optical path of light collected by the system is understood. This is because the final product of DOAS is the concentration of a particular species integrated along the path that radiation covers in the <b>atmosphere.</b> This <b>path</b> is not known a priori and can only be evaluated by Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs). These models are used to calculate the so called vertical column density of a given trace gas, which is obtained by dividing the measured slant column density to the so called air mass factor, which is used to quantify the enhancement of the light path length within the absorber layers. In the case of the standard DOAS set-up, in which radiation is collected along the vertical direction (zenith-sky DOAS), calculations of the air mass factor have been made using “simple” single scattering radiative transfer models. This configuration has its highest sensitivity in the stratosphere, in particular during twilight. This is the result of the large enhancement in stratospheric light path at dawn and dusk combined with a relatively short tropospheric path. In order to increase the sensitivity of the instrument towards tropospheric signals, measurements with the telescope pointing the horizon (offaxis DOAS) have to be performed. In this circumstances, the light path in the lower layers can become very long and necessitate the use of radiative transfer models including multiple scattering, the full treatment of atmospheric sphericity and refraction. In this thesis, a recent development in the well-established DOAS technique is described, referred to as Multiple AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS). The MAX-DOAS consists in the simultaneous use of several off-axis directions near the horizon: using this configuration, not only the sensitivity to tropospheric trace gases is greatly improved, but vertical profile information can also be retrieved by combining the simultaneous off-axis measurements with sophisticated RTM calculations and inversion techniques. In particular there is a need for a RTM which is capable of dealing with all the processes intervening along the light path, supporting all DOAS geometries used, and treating multiple scattering events with varying phase functions involved. To achieve these multiple goals a statistical approach based on the Monte Carlo technique should be used. A Monte Carlo RTM generates an ensemble of random photon paths between the light source and the detector, and uses these paths to reconstruct a remote sensing measurement. Within the present study, the Monte Carlo radiative transfer model PROMSAR (PROcessing of Multi-Scattered Atmospheric Radiation) has been developed and used to correctly interpret the slant column densities obtained from MAX-DOAS measurements. In order to derive the vertical concentration profile of a trace gas from its slant column measurement, the AMF is only one part in the quantitative retrieval process. One indispensable requirement is a robust approach to invert the measurements and obtain the unknown concentrations, the air mass factors being known. For this purpose, in the present thesis, we have used the Chahine relaxation method. Ground-based Multiple AXis DOAS, combined with appropriate radiative transfer models and inversion techniques, is a promising tool for atmospheric studies in the lower troposphere and boundary layer, including the retrieval of profile information with a good degree of vertical resolution. This thesis has presented an application of this powerful comprehensive tool for the study of a preserved natural Mediterranean area (the Castel Porziano Estate, located 20 km South-West of Rome) where pollution is transported from remote sources. Application of this tool in densely populated or industrial areas is beginning to look particularly fruitful and represents an important subject for future studies...|$|R
40|$|Water vapor in the {{atmosphere}} {{plays an important role}} in meteorological applications. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides accurate all-weather observations. The application of the existing GNSS infrastructure for atmosphere sounding leads to rather inexpensive and reliable measurements of the atmospheric water vapor. Observations from GNSS networks contain information about the spatial and temporal distribution of the water vapor. Therefore, the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) developed a water vapor tomography system to derive 3 -Dimensional (3 D) distributions of the tropospheric water vapor above Germany. The tomography makes use of the products provided by the GNSS processing center of the GFZ, where {{the atmosphere}} processing is currently limited to the Global Positioning System (GPS). Input data for the water vapor tomography are the GPS tropospheric products from about 300 ground stations. The GPS tropospheric products are Zenith Total Delay (ZTD), Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) and Slant Total Delay (STD). The accuracy of STDs is one of the important factors for the quality of the derived water vapor tomography. However, the Earth Parameter and Orbit System Software (EPOS), which is used to estimate the GPS-STDs at GFZ, provides only limited information about the accuracy of STDs. Three months of Water Vapor Radiometer (WVR) data are used to validate the GPS-STD and estimate its accuracy. By comparing the GPS-STD observations with systematic hemisphere scans of the WVR it could be shown that inhomogeneous atmospheric structures are reliably reproduced by the STDs. The validation has shown a high accuracy of the estimated STDs. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the water vapor tomography and to provide atmospheric water vapor products with good quality. A new tomographic algorithm based on a Kalman filter is added in the GFZ tomography system. The output is a 3 D humidity field with a temporal resolution of 2. 5 min and the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed states. The error covariance matrices for the observations and the covariance matrices for the uncertainty of the propagation are estimated in advance. The output has been validated with the Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (MART) tomography and radiosonde profiles. Besides the accuracy of STDs, the quality of the derived tomography is depending on many factors such as the spatial coverage of the <b>atmosphere</b> with slant <b>paths</b> and the spatial distribution of their intersections. This leads to temporal and spatial variations of the reconstruction quality. Independent observations are required to validate the generated water vapor tomography. One year of radiosonde data from the German Weather Service (DWD) have been used for the validation. The wet refractivity field of the tomography with about 50 km horizontal resolution and 500 m vertical resolution has been interpolated to the RS profiles. The validations have been carried out point-by-point and also for the whole profile. A new technique has been developed to quantify the differences between humidity profiles. By considering the shape of the whole profile much more reliable conclusions can be drawn than by comparing only point-by-point differences. This method can be applied to improve the algorithms of GPS tomography. Further attempts have been made to analyze the long-term IWV time series. Since the GPS data are available for more than 10 years, the GPS-IWV time series are used for climatological studies and they will become more important in future when long time series will be available. Trends have been calculated for the period 2002 - 2012 using the IWV from the German GPS ground-based network. Different methods (per station or per region) have been used to analyze the IWV time series. The methods will be helpful for meteorologists to analyze variations of the local or regional weather. The investigations demonstrated that the ZTD/IWV and STD/SIWV could describe the amount of water vapor and its distribution in the troposphere reliably. Especially the spatial and temporal variation of the water vapor distribution in the troposphere can be estimated with the tomographic technique. The quality of the derived 3 D humidity fields has been checked with the help of radiosonde data. In general the result of the validation is good but it shows a need to improve the quality of the water vapor tomography. With the development of GNSS (more satellites and more GNSS stations) and with improved algorithms (e. g., introduction of radiometer or radiosonde data), the tomography will in future provide a more complete view of the water vapor distribution {{in the atmosphere}}. In addition with increasing of GNSS time series, they can also be used for long-term studies. The GNSS meteorology can be widely applied in many fields, e. g., nowcasting, severe weather monitoring and data assimilation...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing of land surface {{temperature}} (LST) {{is a complex}} task. From a satellite-based perspective the radiative properties of the land surface and the atmosphere are inextricably linked. Knowledge of both is required if one is to accurately measure {{the temperature of the}} land surface from a space-borne platform. In practice, most satellite-based sensors designed to measure LST over the surface of the Earth are polar orbiting. They scan swaths of the order of 2000 km, utilizing zenith angles of observation of up to 60 °. As such, satellite viewing geometry is important when comparing estimates of LST between different overpasses of the same point on the Earth's surface. In the case of the <b>atmosphere,</b> the optical <b>path</b> length through which the surfaceleaving radiance propagates increases with increasing zenith angle of observation. A longer optical path may in turn alter the relative contributions which molecular absorption and emission processes make to the radiance measured at the satellite sensor. A means of estimating the magnitudes of these radiative components in relation to the viewing geometry of the satellite needs to be developed if their impacts on the at-sensor radiance are to be accurately accounted for. The problem of accurately describing radiative transfer between the surface and the satellite sensor is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the surface-leaving radiance itself may also vary with sensor viewing geometry. Physical properties of the surface such as emissivity are known to vary as the zenith angle of observation changes. The proportions of sunlit and shaded areas with the field-of-view of the sensor may also change with viewing geometry depending on the type of cover (eg vegetation), further impacting the surface emissivity. Investigation of the change in surface-leaving radiance as the zenith angle of observation varies is then also important in developing a better understanding of the radiative interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. The work in this study investigates the atmospheric impacts using surface brightness temperature measurements from the ATSR- 2 satellite sensor in combination with atmospheric profile data from radiosondes and estimates of the downwelling sky radiance made by a ground-based radiometer. A line-by-line radiative transfer model is used to model the angular impacts of the atmosphere upon the surfaceleaving radiance. Results from the modelling work show that if the magnitude of the upwelling and downwelling sky radiance and atmospheric transmittance are accurately known then the surface-emitted radiance and hence the LST may be retrieved with negligible error. Guided by the outcomes of the modelling work an atmospheric correction term is derived which accounts for absorption and emission by the atmosphere, and is based on the viewing geometry of the satellite sensor and atmospheric properties characteristic of a semi-arid field site near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory (Central Australia). Ground-based angular measurements of surface brightness temperature made by a scanning, self calibrating radiometer situated at this field site are then used to investigate how the surface-leaving radiance varies over a range of zenith angles comparable to that of the ATSR- 2 satellite sensor. Well defined cycles in the angular dependence of surface brightness temperature were observed on both diumal and seasonal timescales in these data. The observed cycles in surface brightness temperature are explained in terms of the interaction between the downwelling sky radiance and the angular dependence of the surface emissivity. The angular surface brightness temperature and surface emissivity information is then applied to derive an LST estimate of high accuracy (approx. 1 K at night and 1 - 2 K during the day), suitable for the validation of satellite-derived LST measurements. Finally, the atmospheric and land surface components of this work are combined to describe surface-atmosphere interaction at the field site. Algorithms are derived for the satellite retrieval of LST for the nadir and forward viewing geometries of the ATSR- 2 sensor, based upon the cycles in the angular dependence of surface brightness temperature observed in situ and the atmospheric correction term developed from the modelling of radiative transfer in the atmosphere. A qualitative assessment of the performance of these algorithms indicates they may obtain comparable accuracy to existing dual angle algorithms (approx. 1. 5 K) in the ideal case and an accuracy of 3 - 4 K in practice, which is limited by knowledge of atmospheric properties (eg downwelling sky radiance and atmospheric transmittance), and the surface emissivity. There are, however, strong prospects of enhanced performance given better estimates of these physical quantities, and if coefficients within the retrieval algorithms are determined over a wider range of observation zenith angles in the future...|$|R
