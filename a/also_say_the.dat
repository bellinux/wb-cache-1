25|$|In February 2010, Dr. Cheryl K. Crawley, Great Falls Public Schools Superintendent, {{established}} {{a task force}} to study the physical plant at GFHS. The task force's charge is to recommend improvements and changes to the buildings, grounds, and physical plant of the high school so that the school can continue to provide a high-quality education while remaining at near-capacity in terms of enrollment. Dr. Crawley's report noted that GFHS currently has dining facilities too small for the size of the student body; requires students, faculty, staff, and the public to walk outdoors during winter weather to move between buildings (a safety hazard); does not integrate the South Campus with the Upper Campus; lacks an adequate HVAC system (particularly in moving fresh air into the interior, as well as moving air around inside the building); cannot accommodate high-bandwidth computer or phone lines; and has poor cell phone, television, and radio reception. The building also lacks zoned heat regulation, which makes some areas of the building too hot and others too cold and reduces energy efficiency. School officials <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Old Gym HVAC system is not functioning well, there are aging light fixtures throughout the building, and the hallways on the second and third floors are dark. Additionally, student traffic flows throughout the building are poor (especially in the skywalk leading to the industrial arts annex), and the industrial arts annex suffers from safety problems.|$|E
500|$|Jon C. Mirsalis's website cites {{a review}} in Moving Picture World which states [...] "There is {{considerable}} {{strength in the}} offering, but it has some bad faults. One of these is melodramatic and insincere acting. The photography is good {{and in spite of}} numerous absurdities the picture has strong moments." [...] Descriptive ads for the film were often informative, an ad by the Crystal Theater would indicate that August wrote and acted in the film, but also did not shy away from film's depiction of charity organizations and instead promoted the films defining message as [...] "Charity Organizations Pay Dearly for Incompetency". Another advertisement would cite the New York World review detailing the propaganda film's intent to gain public attention to incite a [...] "regeneration" [...] of charitable organizations. An advertisement in the El Paso Herald by the Alamo Theater described the film as [...] "a beautiful story of love, devotion and charity. It is a strong moral lesson and should appeal to the [...] "charity workers" [...] in this country." [...] The advertisement would <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> film would make viewers more charitable and good, but the film's critique on charity workers in particular would be far from appealing or well received.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} an environmentalism theme. This theme {{is present in}} the nuclear power plant's polluting of Lake Springfield, which causes the fish of the lake to become mutated. University of the Sciences in Philadelphia physics and mathematics professor Paul Halpern discussed the episode in his book What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe. He comments: [...] "Considering the fact that [...] natural selection takes generations and that successful varieties must sustain a survival advantage over others, the only way Mr. Burns can prove his assertion [...] is by tracking Blinky over time to see if the third eye allows the mutant fish to find food more quickly or dodge predators." [...] Mark Meister and Phyllis M. Japp discuss the environmental theme of the episode in their book Enviropop: Studies in Environmental Rhetoric and Popular Culture. The authors think human pollution is characterized in the episode as an improvement on nature, and human progress is viewed as an [...] "integral" [...] part of human evolution. They add: [...] "These references articulate specific criticism of current environmental regulations, specifically the lax enforcement of the regulations concerning the dumping, safe storage, and disposal of nuclear waste. Furthermore, this episode condemns the manipulation of political and economic power to disguise ecological accountability and to shift blame for environmental problems." [...] The authors <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> episode comments on the lack of adherence to safety standards for the plant, and criticizes the [...] "apathetic acceptance" [...] of unforced environmental inspections. In addition, they comment that the episode [...] "explicitly criticizes media spin-doctors who distort the impacts of ecological degradation caused by wealthy corporations such as the nuclear power plant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Those {{opposed to}} the {{amendment}} say that section one of the amendment is completely unnecessary since Utah already outlaws same-sex marriage. They <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> {{second part of the}} amendment [...] "goes too far". They feel that it would invalidate common law marriage as well as reducing rights to will property to whomever one chooses.|$|E
2500|$|On Rosh Hashanah, {{the night}} Kiddush {{is similar to}} that of the other festivals. Where it differs, it is usually to follow the pattern of middle blessing of the Amidah. (An example is the {{concluding}} formula [...] "Blessed are You, the LORD, King over the entire world, Who sanctifies [...] Israel, and the Day of Remembrance.") During the day, the verses Psalms 81:4-5 are recited prior to the blessing over wine. Many <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> festival verses (usually first), and on Shabbat all recite the relevant verses (see above) at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Observers {{have said}} that {{facts of the case}} simply do not support the {{conclusions}} of the report nor is the report an official report of the committee. They say that the Discovery Institute is using the report to portray Sternberg specifically, and design proponents in general, as victims of persecution. They <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Souder report is a repackaging of the Office of Special Council's previous findings from August 2005 and contains nothing new, consisting of [...] "the OSC findings restated and used as a form of evidence in and of themselves" [...] and attacks the Smithsonian for [...] "not accepting the OSC's findings at face value." [...] They cite as evidence of a biased motive behind the report the longstanding connections of the report's instigators, Congressmen Souder and Santorum, to the Discovery Institute, whose Program Director is Stephen C. Meyer, author of the paper Sternberg published. [...] In 2000 Souder co-hosted a congressional briefing on behalf of the Discovery Institute intended to drum up political support for intelligent design and read a defense of intelligent design prepared by the Discovery Institute into the congressional record. Santorum worked with the Discovery Institute's program director Phillip E. Johnson in 2000 and 2001 drafting the pro-intelligent design Santorum Amendment and in March 2006 wrote the foreword for the book, Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement a collection of essays largely by Discovery Institute fellows honoring Johnson as [...] "father" [...] of the intelligent design movement. Contained in the appendix to the Souder report is a letter from the director of the Smithsonian where it is revealed that Sternberg demanded that they give him a $300,000 grant to make up for his allegedly lost research time; he was turned down. Sternberg's appointment as a Smithsonian Institution research associate was from January 2004 through January 2007. [...] Research associates are not employees of the Museum and appointments are typically awarded for up to three years.|$|E

[...] "Truly," [...] said Christian, [...] "I {{have said}} the truth of Pliable; and if I should <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> truth of myself, it will appear there is not {{betterment}} betwixt him and myself.

60|$|Of {{all places}} that I {{know it is}} the most ungainly and most unsatisfactory: I fear I must <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> most presumptuous in its pretensions. There is a map of Washington {{accurately}} laid down; and taking that map with him in his journeyings, a man may lose himself in the streets, not as one loses one's self in London, between Shoreditch and Russell Square, but as one does so in the deserts of the Holy Land, between Emmaus and Arimathea. In the first place no one knows where the places are, or is sure of their existence, and then between their presumed localities the country is wild, trackless, unbridged, uninhabited, and desolate. Massachusetts Avenue runs the whole length of the city, and is inserted on the maps as a full-blown street, about four miles in length. Go there, and you will find yourself not only out of town, away among the fields, but you will find yourself beyond the fields, in an uncultivated, undrained wilderness. Tucking your trowsers up to your knees you will wade through the bogs, you will lose yourself among rude hillocks, you will be {{out of the reach of}} humanity. The unfinished dome of the Capitol will loom before you in the distance, and you will think that you approach the ruins of some western Palmyra. If you are a sportsman, you will desire to shoot snipe within sight of the President's house. There is much unsettled land within the States of America, but I think none so desolate in its state of nature as three-fourths of the ground on which is supposed to stand the City of Washington.|$|E

50|$|Physically, {{standing}} waves are {{formed by the}} interference (superposition) of waves and their reflections (although one may <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> opposite; that a moving wave is a superposition of {{standing waves}}). The geometric shape of the medium determines {{what would be the}} interference pattern, thus determines the ƒ(x, y, z) form of the standing wave. This space-dependence is called a normal mode.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison {{teaches the}} kindergartners {{not only about}} the word [...] "shit," [...] but also about the word [...] "fag," [...] which he is allowed to say uncensored because he is homosexual.
