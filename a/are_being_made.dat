5|$|The Rovers {{fans have}} good {{relations}} with Spanish club CE Sabadell FC, which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the club had the same colours. Plans <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> for a pre-season friendly between the two clubs in July 2016.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
5|$|Efforts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> {{to monitor}} the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing efforts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away.

The Daniel Lambert pub in Stamford has also closed.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> from someone's memory, leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly {{killed during the}} events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Improvements <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to Union Station, {{which is}} the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} Dromaius {{species were}} present in Australia {{at the time of}} European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, a subspecies known as the Tasmanian emu, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland sub-species, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. While the Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s, more birds have since been introduced, and attempts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> to breed a form similar to the Tasmanian emu. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.|$|E
