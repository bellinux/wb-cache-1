25|$|Nothing {{changed in}} my life since I work all the time. I've spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money I made. The second decade I spent money {{and no one was}} asking about that. And I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in the two}} {{charters}} of 966, Edgar showed {{generosity and}} recognised the bonds of kinship, it has been <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of it was driven by pressure rather than good will. In favour of the former, Andrew Wareham has suggested that in naming his third and most 'throneworthy' son (b. after c. 964) Æthelred, after his great-great-uncle and thus after Ælfgifu's and Æthelweard's ancestor (see genealogy ↑), Edgar may have intended to make a sympathetic gesture by which he stressed their kinship.|$|E

30|$|Job {{resources}} were assessed using the Instrument for Stress-Related Task Analysis (ISTA, Semmer et al. 1999). We included items on qualification requirements, participation in decision-making, and job control for {{an index of}} job resources (for a composite measure of task related job resources see Frese (1999) for a similar procedure with items from the ISTA). Qualification requirements were assessed with an item <b>asking</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> knowledge and skills the participant’s work requires, scored from 1 (very little) to 5 (very much). Participation in decision-making was assessed by an item <b>asking</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> influence people had on decisions that concerned their situation as employees, possible answers being “I have no influence” (1), “I just get informed” (2), “I can make suggestions” (3), “I take part in these decisions” (4), and “I have a large influence on these decisions” (5). Job control was measured using an item <b>asking</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> one’s work offered possibilities to decide on things, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).|$|R
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far too many to record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E
500|$|Gateshead Council {{subsequently}} considered {{other sites}} {{for a second}} park, but it was discouraged by the high prices being asked by the estate owners at Redheugh and Shipcote. The Shipcote estate was owned by Sir Walter James, who was approached by a council park committee in 1874 and <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{would be required to}} purchase at least part of his estate. Whilst negotiations were ongoing, James' offer to sell part of his estate at £650 per acre was met by fierce criticism from members of the public and the council began to seek an alternative to the Shipcote proposal. The town clerk wrote to William Wailes to ask if {{he would be willing to}} sell his [...] Saltwellside estate. On 11November1874, Wailes replied that the council could have his entire estate for £32,000, and in March 1875 James told the park committee that he did not wish to compete with Wailes but that he would offer a subscription if the council went ahead at Saltwellgate. Later that month the park committee formally opened talks with Wailes and, after various proposals were considered and rejected, in September 1875 the council decided to buy the entire Saltwellgate estate for an increased total price of £35,000 after securing a loan for the full amount from the Local Government Board. The agreement was formalised two months later and included a provision to lease Saltwell Towers back to Wailes for the remainder of his life.|$|E

5000|$|In {{description}} part, {{health status}} {{is measured in}} terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in [...] "work, study, housework, family or leisure activities". In pain/discomfort dimension, it <b>asks</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it <b>asks</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the debate}} on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, some {{commentators}} claimed that a draft provision (omitted in the adopted bill) to give money to funds run by the U.S. Department of the Treasury could potentially lead to money flowing to groups like ACORN. When <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money ACORN or other community groups would get, a spokesman for Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank, said, [...] "Absolutely none. All funds would go to state and local governments." [...] Critics also claimed that ACORN's complex organizational structure allowed it to escape public scrutiny.|$|E

The hospitality was especially developed in Siberia.

He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look {{over his shoulder at the}} fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E

2500|$|The Commission opened {{negotiations}} with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache at Fort Sill on September 26, 1892. Jerome made an opening presentation, and Quanah Parker asked specifically how much money per acre, and what were the terms offered. Jerome stalled {{on the details of}} money. Other tribal members preferred to defer the negotiations until the Treaty of Medicine Lodge expired. [...] At the next day's session, Parker continued to press Jerome for financial details, as Jerome avoided discussing the money. Sayre detailed the overall offer of $2,000,000 and per capita distribution. Parker once again <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> per acre. Sayre didn't have an answer, and Parker asked him how he arrived at $2,000,000. To that, Sayre replied, [...] "...we just guess at it." [...] Parker stated that he had heard about price per acre differential between the various tribal agreements. Lone Wolf added that many wanted to defer until the expiration of the Medicine Lodge treaty.|$|E
