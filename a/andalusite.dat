25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, <b>andalusite,</b> and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while <b>andalusite</b> and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like stishovite (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. <b>Andalusite</b> has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E
25|$|On {{the western}} edge of the Yilgarn Craton, {{partially}} covered by Phanerozoic sedimentary basins and in faulted contact with the 2.7 Ga to 2.55 Ga Yilgarn tectonic domains, lies the Jumperding Gneiss Complex of 2.75 to 2.65 Ga age, composed primarily of micaceous quartzite, quartz-feldspar-biotite-garnet gneiss, <b>andalusite</b> and sillimanite schists, banded iron formation and other exotics, intruded by minor masses of porphyritic granite.|$|E
25|$|The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, <b>andalusite,</b> and sillimanite, all Al2SiO5 – are {{structurally}} {{composed of}} one 4− tetrahedron, and one Al3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al3+ {{can be in}} six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (<b>andalusite)</b> or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiO4)3), almandine (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3), and spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3). The ugrandite garnets have Ca2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3), grossular (Ca3Al2(SiO4)3) and andradite (Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.|$|E
25|$|Coordination polyhedra are {{geometric}} representation {{of how a}} cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si4+ surrounded by four O2−. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: {{in the case of}} the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination by oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure such as in the mantle, many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a perovskite structure, where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite, <b>andalusite,</b> and sillimanite (polymorphs, as they share the formula Al2SiO5), which differ by the coordination number of the Al3+; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature. In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.|$|E
2500|$|... {{sedimentary}} formations - includes sediments {{deposited in}} Silurian waters and metamorphosed during the Devonian period, {{as well as}} carbon and more recent sediments, resulting during the Quaternary. The first group includes principally schists and quartz-feldspar, greywackes and quartzites with meta-crystals, such as <b>andalusite,</b> cordierite and sillimanite. These sedminentary deposits are prominently preserved in two linear patches: Vale das Antas and Louriça, near Castro Laboreiro, between two granite structures. The most recent geological formations are those created by fluvial, torrential and glacial deposits.|$|E
2500|$|Almandine, {{sometimes}} incorrectly called almandite, is {{the modern}} gem known as carbuncle (though originally almost any red gemstone was known by this name). The term [...] "carbuncle" [...] {{is derived from}} the Latin meaning [...] "live coal" [...] or burning charcoal. The name Almandine is a corruption of Alabanda, a region in Asia Minor where these stones were cut in ancient times. [...] Chemically, almandine is an iron-aluminium garnet [...] with the formula Fe3Al2(SiO4)3; the deep red transparent stones are often called precious garnet and are used as gemstones (being the most common of the gem garnets). Almandine occurs in metamorphic rocks like mica schists, associated with minerals such as staurolite, kyanite, <b>andalusite,</b> and others. Almandine has nicknames of Oriental garnet, almandine ruby, and carbuncle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mountain}} is largely composed of highly metamorphosed 400-million-year-old schist and quartzite rock primarily {{associated with the}} Devonian Littleton Formation, a stratum that extends south into Massachusetts and north into the White Mountains. At lower elevations on the mountain, and stratigraphically below the Littleton Formation, the bedrock is from the Silurian period, consisting of Rangeley Formation schists, Perry Mountain Formation quartzites, the Francestown Formation granulite, and the Warner Formation granulite. Structurally, the {{mountain is}} part of an overturned syncline– called a fold nappe– that was caused by the compressional forces of the Acadian orogeny. Dramatic small- to medium-scale metamorphic folds are visible on many of the rock faces of the mountain, including the famous Billings Fold (a recumbent syncline found about [...] west of the summit), shown in the 1942 edition of Marland P. Billings' Structural Geology. In addition to impressive folds, the Devonian Littleton Formation also shows large pseudomorphs of sillimanite after <b>andalusite.</b> These sillimanite crystals, normally needle thin, occur as [...] "turkey tracks" [...] on Mount Monadnock and were formed during prograde metamorphism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Andalusite</b> is {{a common}} {{metamorphic}} mineral which forms under low pressure and low to high temperatures.

50|$|Chiastolite is {{a variety}} of the mineral <b>andalusite</b> with the {{chemical}} composition Al2SiO5. It is noted for distinctive cross-shaped black inclusions of graphite. In areas around Georgetown, California, metamorphosed sediments contained <b>andalusite</b> and chiastolite in a graphite rich metasediment. The chiastolite crystals have been pseudomorphically altered by a mixture of muscovite, paragonite and margarite. The calcium rich margarite tends to form along the graphite rich crosses or bands within the chiastolite. Mineralogically the occurrence is important because all three white mica phases are present in an equilibrium assemblage.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} regarding {{the formation of}} the chiastolite cross, however the most widely accepted theory, proposed by Frondel in 1934, suggests that there is a selective attachment of impurities at the rapidly growing corners of <b>andalusite</b> crystals. As the concentration of these impurities (which consist primarily of graphite) increases, the growth of the crystal is slowed. This concentrated impurity deposit forms a re-entrant as it is absorbed by the growth of the <b>andalusite</b> porphyroblast. The cycle of growth-retardation-growth then repeats itself, creating a featherlike pattern of graphite along four radiating 'arms'.|$|E
50|$|The Cambro-Ordovician {{metamorphic}} rocks comprise migmatites of upper amphibolite facies grade, mica schists with <b>andalusite,</b> cordierite and staurolite of lower amphibolite facies grade, and phyllites of greenschist facies grade.|$|E

50|$|During the Variscan orogeny in the Pennsylvanian about 310 {{million years}} ago the sediments of the Canaveilles Group were metamorphosed under mesozonal {{conditions}} (amphibolite facies). The original shales transformed into mica schists of the cordierite, <b>andalusite</b> and sillimanite zone in {{the lower part of}} the section, higher up they only converted to greenschist facies phyllites of the biotite zone. The carbonaceous intercalations became marbles and calcsilicates. Close to the contact with the “transitional gneiss” first the <b>andalusite</b> isograd is reached, followed by the cordierite isograd. This indicates a magmatic origin of the gneisses formed from intrusive granitoids.|$|E
50|$|Sillimanite is one {{of three}} {{aluminosilicate}} polymorphs, the other two being <b>andalusite</b> and kyanite. A common variety of sillimanite is known as fibrolite, so named because the mineral appears like a bunch of fibres twisted together when viewed in thin section or even by the naked eye. Both the fibrous and traditional forms of sillimanite are common in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. It is an index mineral indicating high temperature but variable pressure. Example rocks include gneiss and granulite. It occurs with <b>andalusite,</b> kyanite, potassium feldspar, almandine, cordierite, biotite and quartz in schist, gneiss, hornfels and also rarely in pegmatites.|$|E
50|$|Metamorphic {{minerals}} {{are those}} that form only at the high temperatures and pressures associated {{with the process of}} metamorphism. These minerals, known as index minerals, include sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, <b>andalusite,</b> and some garnet.|$|E
