40|$|The reduced {{dynamics}} for {{dark and}} bright soliton chains in the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation {{is used to}} study the behavior of collective compression waves. For appropriate conditions, the reduced dynamics derived from perturbation and variational techniques allows to describe a chain of dark or bright solitons as a chain of effective masses connected by nonlinear springs taking {{the form of a}} Toda lattice model on the soliton's positions. In turn, the Toda lattice possesses exact solitary <b>travelling</b> <b>compression</b> wave solutions corresponding to <b>travelling</b> <b>compression</b> waves in the original soliton chain. We coin the term hypersoliton to describe such solitary waves riding on a chain of solitons. We corroborate our analytical results with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It is observed {{that in the case of}} dark soliton chains, the formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the robust evolution of <b>travelling</b> <b>compression</b> waves. In contrast, bright soliton chains do not have such stable propagating solutions due to the desynchronization of the mutual phases between consecutive solitons during evolution. Finally, as an application to Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a standard external harmonic trapping potential, we study the case of finite dark soliton chain confined at the center of the trap. We find that when the central chain is hit by a dark soliton initiated at the edge of the external trap, the energy is transferred through the chain as a hypersoliton. When the hypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected away from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the trap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton. This periodic evolution is the equivalent of the classical Newton's cradle. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

In both applications excellent results without relevant side effects were found in clinical trials. The technical principle of {{pressure pulse}} source is based on the same techniques used in air guns. A projectile is accelerated by pressurized air and hits the applicator with high kinetic energy. By this a <b>compression</b> wave <b>travels</b> through the material and induces a fast (4 [...] 5 μs), almost singular pressure pulse of 2 [...] 10 MPa, which is followed by an equally short rarefaction phase of about the same amplitude. It is assumed that the pressure pulse accounts for the biomedical effects of the device. The slower inertial motion of the waveguide is damped by elastic stoppers, but still can be measured several micro seconds after the initial pressure pulse. In order to characterize the pressure pulse devices, field mapping is performed on several radial pressure pulse sources using the fiber optic hydrophone and a polyvinylidenfluorid (PVDF) piezoelectric hydrophone. It could be shown that the current standard (IEC 61846) is not appropriate for characterization of ballistic pressure pulse sources...|$|R

The latter leads to much more important cumulated viscoplastic strain than the former. Indeed, for an overstress close to 10 ^ 2 MPa, the effective cumulated strain rate has largely increased for that model (see Fig. 21), which yields a more important viscoplastic flow. As the compression slot passes within the inclusion, viscoplastic flow concentrates in the inclusion close to the rear part of the interface with the matrix (see Fig. 23). This {{is provided by the}} circular geometry of the inclusion that defines a concentrating profile as the <b>compression</b> wave <b>travels</b> rightward. In Figs. 24 and 25, isovalues of the effective viscoplastic strain rate are shown at two successive instants, as the compression slot passes. The observed profiles appear quite different in terms of the chosen viscoplastic constitutive model. In particular, the saturation of the overstress predicted by expression (60) combined with the particular rear geometry of the interface inclusion/matrix yield an effective strain rate that reaches very high numerical values on a narrow band. This small example illustrates the importance of the chosen viscoplastic constitutive model on the propagated viscoplastic strains in a dynamic process.|$|R

We demonstrate that electrons propagate along the magnetic field lines in the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL), while close to the current sheet center the electron distribution is isotropic.

Most of the field-aligned energetic ion beams are associated with the field-aligned electron beams and about half of them have the bipolar fluctuation of the meridional magnetic field component. Moreover they often show a normal velocity dispersion for the different species which fits well in the scenario of particle propagation from a single source. All features above are observed during jovian reconfiguration events which are typically bonded with plasma flow reversals.

40|$|We {{study the}} shock-driven {{turbulent}} mixing {{that occurs when}} a perturbed planar density interface is impacted by a planar shock wave of moderate strength and subsequently reshocked. The present work is a systematic study {{of the influence of}} the relative molecular weights of the gases {{in the form of the}} initial Atwood ratio A. We investigate the cases A = ± 0. 21, ± 0. 67 and ± 0. 87 that correspond to the realistic gas combinations air–CO_ 2, air–SF_ 6 and H_ 2 –air. A canonical, three-dimensional numerical experiment, using the large-eddy simulation technique with an explicit subgrid model, reproduces the interaction within a shock tube with an endwall where the incident shock Mach number is ~ 1. 5 and the initial interface perturbation has a fixed dominant wavelength and a fixed amplitude-to-wavelength ratio ~ 0. 1. For positive Atwood configurations, the reshock is followed by secondary waves in the form of alternate expansion and <b>compression</b> waves <b>travelling</b> between the endwall and the mixing zone. These reverberations are shown to intensify turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation across the mixing zone. In contrast, negative Atwood number configurations produce multiple secondary reshocks following the primary reshock, and their effect on the mixing region is less pronounced. As the magnitude of A is increased, the mixing zone tends to evolve less symmetrically. The mixing zone growth rate following the primary reshock approaches a linear evolution prior to the secondary wave interactions. When considering the full range of examined Atwood numbers, measurements of this growth rate do not agree well with predictions of existing analytic reshock models such as the model by Mikaelian (Physica D, vol. 36, 1989, p. 343). Accordingly, we propose an empirical formula and also a semi-analytical, impulsive model based on a diffuse-interface approach to describe the A-dependence of the post-reshock growth rate...|$|R

During this substorm, the Cluster spacecraft were located around 15 R E downtail, 8 R E from midnight in the pre-midnight sector and just 2 R E above the equatorial plane (in GSM coordinates). At expansion phase onset the Cluster spacecraft were located in the plasma sheet, tailward of a near-Earth neutral line and detected a significant time delay of 6 min between the tail field B z component becoming negative and the subsequent detection of Earthward flows.

Studying the timing of known substorm expansion phase onset signatures from a variety of instruments collecting data in key regions of the magnetosphere, ionosphere and on the ground allowed comparison of the events chosen to substorm onset models. Two substorm case studies are presented for intervals during which complementary data sets were available. The principal data sets came from the Fluxgate magnetometer (FGM), Plasma Electron and Current Experiment (PEACE), Cluster Ion Experiment (CIS) and Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors (RAPID) instruments on the Cluster spacecraft. It was only possible to determine the onset mechanism for one of the three substorms studied (the near-Earth neutral line model).

The increase in accelerative wave intensity following PCI was proportionate to the baseline FFR and CFVR, such that stenting of lesions associated with the greatest flow limitation (lowest FFR and CFVR) resulted in the largest increases in wave intensity.

The second drop-out in the plasma sheet also includes a reversal of the ion flow, a signature consistent with the passage of a reconnecting X-line past the spacecraft. Between the X-lines, the plasma outflow from the X-lines caused an increase in pressure which led to a localised expansion of the plasma and also the observations at Cluster 1 and Cluster 4 and the TCR.

At industry scale, extra malaxation time is required to reach the optimal paste temperature, usually around 15 - 20 minutes for 30 °C. The aim of this work is to show the results obtained from experiments carried out, at laboratory scale, applying high-power ultrasounds during the malaxation step {{and its effect on}} oil characteristics. High-power ultrasound application on olive paste has shown a positive effect on length of malaxation step. It provides a quick-heating of olive paste without alteration of olive oil composition. Two main mechanisms are involved in the ultrasonic treatment on olives and on olive paste: a thermal effect and a mechanical effect. The thermal effect was due to the attenuation characteristics of the medium. The mechanical effect is due to cavitation or particulate streaming which cause violent movement of the particles of the medium. Sound waves, which have frequencies higher than 20 kHz, are mechanical vibrations in a solid, liquid and gas. Unlike electromagnetic waves, sound waves must travel in a matter and they involve expansion and <b>compression</b> cycles during <b>travel</b> in the medium. Expansion pulls molecules apart and compression pushes them together. The expansion can create bubbles in a liquid and produce negative pressure. The bubbles form, grow and finally collapse. Close to a solid boundary, cavity collapse is asymmetric and produces high-speed jets of liquid that have strong impact on the solid surface and can disrupt biological cell walls. The mechanical effect of ultrasounds promotes the release of soluble compounds from the plant body by disrupting cell walls and improves mass transfer also in the olive tissues. The ultrasound technology provides a reduction of malaxing time improving extractability of oil and its antioxidant content both of Coratina and Paranzana variety...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were conducted to}} investigate key physical mechanisms responsible for flame-acoustic coupling during the onset of acoustically driven combustion instabilities in liquid rocket engines (LREs). Controlled experiments were conducted in which a turbulent hydrogen-oxygen (GH 2 -GO 2) diffusion flame, established downstream of a two-dimensional model shear coaxial injector was acoustically forced by a compression driver unit mounted in a transverse direction and excited through {{a broad range of}} frequencies (200 Hz- 2000 Hz) and amplitudes. Characteristic interactions between flame and acoustics visualized through OH* and CH* chemiluminescence imaging and dynamic pressure measurements obtained using high frequency dynamic pressure transducers indicated that small acoustic disturbances could be amplified by flame-acoustic coupling under certain conditions leading to substantial modulation in spatial heat release fluctuations. Density gradient between fuel and oxidizer was found to significantly affect the way acoustic waves interacted with density stratified flame fronts. The particular case of an asymmetric flame front oscillation under transverse acoustic forcing indicated that baroclinic vorticity, generated by the interactions between misaligned pressure gradient (across the acoustic wave) and density gradient (across the fuel oxidizer interface) could further amplify flame front distortions. Asymmetric interaction between flame and acoustics is shown to occur preferentially on flame fronts where controlled waves from the <b>compression</b> driver <b>travel</b> from lighter fluid to denser fluid and the amount of interaction between flame and acoustics is shown to depend strongly on the density ratio between the fluids on either sides of the flame front. This observation is in agreement with the baroclinic vorticity mechanism and a variant of the classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability mechanism. The results provide the first known experimental evidence that baroclinic vorticity could play a role in triggering flame-acoustic interactions associated with LRE shear coaxial injectors. Parametric studies investigating the sensitivity of flame-acoustic interaction on key physical parameters that govern shear coaxial injector operations (including density ratio, velocity ratio, momentum ratio and chemical composition of the fuel) were conducted by varying the parameter of interest independently while holding the other parameters relatively constant. Density ratios ranging from 1 to 16, velocity ratios ranging from 3. 02 to 5. 27, momentum ratios ranging from 0. 67 to 2. 12 and fuel mixtures ranging from pure hydrogen to 10 %- 90 % GH 2 -GCH 4 combination were tested. It is shown that in the ranges considered, flame-acoustic interaction is most sensitively affected by density ratio changes. Spectral measurements of flame front oscillations using local chemiluminescence measurements further revealed the non-linear nature of the interaction process : a flame system forced at 1150 Hz gave rise not only to 1150 Hz oscillations but also triggered flame oscillations occurring at substantially lower frequencies. Analytical models were developed to interpret and predict acoustic modes of a combustion chamber containing a density stratified flowfield subjected to transverse acoustic disturbances. Incorporating both the known phenomenon of jet mixing length and the new experimental result of preferential excitation, the models allow different resonant behaviors to occur for separate regions of the combustor bounded by sudden changes in density. For isothermal experiments where the flow temperature was known, calculated Eigen frequencies were in good agreement with measured frequencies. Overall, the identification of fuel-oxidizer density ratio as a critical parameter and the identification of baroclinic vorticity as a potential mechanism in flame acoustic coupling are significant because a reduction in the density gradient between fuel and oxidizer {{can be used as a}} control mechanism to improve flame stability in liquid rocket engines...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the magnetic field and plasma signatures of reconnection events observed with the Cassini spacecraft during the tail orbits of 2006. We examine their “local” properties in terms of magnetic field reconfiguration and changing plasma flows. We also describe the “global” impact of reconnection {{in terms of the}} contribution to mass loss, flux closure, and large scale tail structure. The signatures of 69 plasmoids, 17 <b>travelling</b> <b>compression</b> regions (TCRs), and 13 planetward-moving structures have been found. The direction of motion is inferred from the sign of the change in the Bθ component of the magnetic field in the first instance, and confirmed through plasma flow data where available. The plasmoids are interpreted as detached structures, observed by the spacecraft tailward of the reconnection site and the TCRs are interpreted as the effects of the draping and compression of lobe magnetic field lines around passing plasmoids. We focus on the analysis and interpretation of the tailward-moving (south-to-north field change) plasmoids and TCRs in this work, considering the planetward-moving signatures only {{from the point of view}} of understanding the reconnection x-line position and recurrence rates. We discuss the location spread of the observations, showing that where spacecraft coverage is symmetric about midnight, reconnection signatures are observed more frequently on the dawn flank than on the dusk flank. We show an example of a chain of two plasmoids and two TCRs over three hours, and suggest that such a scenario is associated with a single reconnection event ejecting multiple successive plasmoids. Plasma data reveal that one of these plasmoids contains H[*]+[*]at lower energy and W[*]+[*]at higher energy, consistent with an inner magnetospheric source, and the total flow speed inside the plasmoid is estimated with an upper limit of 170 [*]km/s. We probe the interior structure of plasmoids and find that the vast majority of examples at Saturn show a localized decrease in field magnitude as the spacecraft passes through the structure. We take the trajectory of Cassini into account, as, during 2006, the spacecraft's largely equatorial position beneath the hinged current sheet meant that it rarely traversed the centre of plasmoids. We present an innovative method of optimizing the window size for minimum variance analysis (MVA) and apply this MVA across several plasmoids to explore their interior morphology in more detail, finding that Saturn's tail contains both loop-like and flux rope-like plasmoids. We estimate the mass lost downtail through reconnection and suggest that the apparent imbalance between mass input and observed plasmoid ejection may mean that alternative mass loss methods contribute to balancing Saturn's mass budget. We also estimate the rate of magnetic flux closure in the tail and find that, where open field line closure is active, it plays a very significant role in flux cycling at Saturn...|$|R
