For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is <b>also</b> <b>often</b> avoided.|$|E

5|$|Pericles' {{manner of}} thought and rhetorical {{charisma}} {{may have been in}} part products of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and skepticism about divine phenomena.

Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is <b>also</b> <b>often</b> noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
