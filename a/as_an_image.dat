5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> on stamps because of its {{association}} with {{the recent history of}} both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention to the campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly identify it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of the entrance).|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E

5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba (IAST: Khaṇḍobā), Martanda Bhairava or Malhari, is a Hindu deity worshipped as {{a manifestation}} of Shiva mainly in the Deccan plateau of India, {{especially}} in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. He is the most popular Kuladaivat (family deity) in Maharashtra. He is also the patron deity of select warrior, farming, herding and Brahmin (priestly) castes as well as several of the hunter/gatherer tribes that are native to the hills and forests of this region. The cult of Khandoba has linkages with Vaishnava and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective of caste, including Muslims. The worship of Khandoba developed during the 9th and 10th centuries from a folk deity into a composite god possessing the attributes of Shiva, Bhairava, Surya and Karttikeya (Skanda). He is depicted either {{in the form of a}} Lingam, or <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of a warrior riding on a bull or a horse. The foremost centre of Khandoba worship is Jejuri in Maharashtra. The legends of Khandoba, found in the text Malhari Mahatmya and also narrated in folk songs, revolve around his victory over demons Mani-malla and his marriages.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and network share filesystems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data.|$|E

As outlined below, one may now, typically, use <b>an</b> <b>image</b> processing computer program to simulate the effect of using color filters, using <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source <b>image</b> <b>a</b> pair of either color or monochrome images.

25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> or alias of the desired signal.|$|E
25|$|Klein {{showed that}} the modular group moves the {{fundamental}} region of the complex plane so as to tessellate that plane. In 1879, {{he looked at the}} action of PSL(2,7), thought of <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface today called the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y+y3z+z3x=0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.|$|E
25|$|According to Louis Massignon {{there are}} many {{different}} attitudes among Shiites and Sunnis about the Mubahalah. One of those disagreements is in terms of the approving of the verse of Quran on Mubahalah whether the verse III, 54 was with the presence of the five persons such as Fatima. According to Shia sources not only Mubahala happened with the presence of Fatima but also Fatima considered as someone who is standing back of prophet. In other words, some mystical sects refer to the symbolic role during that event. They try to interpret her <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>image.</b> This image shows a lighting matter. Some sects such as Nusayrieh believes that the Christians of Najran acknowledge to the place of Fatima as Maryam.|$|E
