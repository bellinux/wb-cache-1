5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, {{they will be given}} an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E

But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E

25|$|A superstition exists among troops {{about the}} Charms candies {{that come with}} some menus: they are {{considered}} bad luck, especially if actually eaten. Some attribute this to <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dislike becoming a superstition (i.e. not eating them 'just in case' or because it might make one's comrades uneasy). In March 2007, The Salt Lake Tribune invited three gourmet chefs to taste-test 18 MRE meals. None of the meals rated higher than a 5.7 average {{on a scale of}} 1-to-10, and the chicken fajita meal, in particular, was singled out for disdain, rating an average score of 1.3. Early in the war in Afghanistan, among the international troops who mingle at Bagram Air Base, a single French combat ration (cassoulet, perhaps, with deer pâté and nougat) could be traded for at least five American Meals Ready to Eat.|$|E

25|$|These color divides {{reinforced}} racial {{barriers between}} African and Brazilian slaves, and often created animosity between them. These differences were heightened after freedom was granted, for lighter skin correlated with social mobility {{and the greater}} chance an ex-slave could distance him- or herself from their former slave life. Thus, mulattoes and lighter-skinned ex-slaves had larger opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status {{within the confines of}} the colonial Brazilian social structure. As a consequence, self-segregation was common, as mulattoes preferred to separate their identity as much as possible from blacks. One way this is visible is from data on church marriages during the 19th century. Church marriage was an expensive affair, and one only the more successful ex-slaves were able to afford, and these marriages were also almost always endogamous. The fact that skin color largely dictated possible partners in marriage promoted racial distinctions as well. Interracial marriage was a rarity, and was almost always <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> union between a white man and a mulatto woman.|$|E

500|$|An intein is a [...] "parasitic" [...] {{segment of}} a protein that {{is able to}} excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the {{ribosome}} and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond {{in such a manner}} that the main protein [...] "backbone" [...] does not fall apart. This is <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein changing its own primary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene. Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break repair mechanism. This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.|$|E

[...] Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value attempted in 1867 another approach: he argued that Raskolnikov was a product of his environment, and explained that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy and understanding with which Dostoyevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoyevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: [...] "This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it."* McDuff, xi–xii ...|$|E

[...] Instead of being <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vessel with shark fins bound for an American port, the case was instead covered by the regulations on possession, since the KD II was bound for a foreign port, and those provisions were specific to fishing vessels.
