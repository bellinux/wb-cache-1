5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous.

5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> light machine gun.|$|E

5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> inhibitor.|$|E

5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Ted {{started work}} in February 1961 as an {{assistant}} district attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he first developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime. He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours {{with the goal of}} improving his foreign policy credentials. On a nine-nation Latin American trip in 1961, FBI reports from the time showed Kennedy meeting with Lauchlin Currie, an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals in each country whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers. Reports from the FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour. The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy's foreign policy views, and in subsequent Boston Globe columns he warned that the region might turn to Communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> way. Kennedy also began speaking to local political clubs and organizations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory. The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E

5|$|The Bismarcks' use of four twin turrets (the 4 × 2 configuration) was {{a design}} {{practice}} that hearkened {{back to the}} First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while {{reducing the number of}} turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the Bismarcks, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> sequence of salvoes.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossbows}} {{and early}} firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated {{rapidly in the}} field, often becoming unusable {{after a few weeks}} of campaigning due to the effects of the climate.

The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion.
