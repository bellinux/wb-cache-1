50|$|The GCWR is a {{function}} of the torque output of the engine, the capacity and ratios of the transmission, the capacity of the driving <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres,</b> the capacity of the radiator, and the ability of the chassis to withstand that powertrain torque.|$|E
50|$|The 1Z was {{powered by}} the Tipo 61 4,940 cc side valve, {{monobloc}} head inline-four cylinder engine, with 70 hp at 2,200 rpm.The chassis was a conventional ladder frame with solid axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs; brakes were on the transmission and on the rear wheels. The transmission was a Tipo 105 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate dry clutch.Main differences from the Theta's mechanicals were wider <b>axle</b> tracks, <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> metal disc wheels more suited to military use.The vehicle had {{a top speed of}} 60 km/h and could carry 2.2 tons of cargo.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, {{his forces}} dug in {{and waited for}} the {{eventual}} attack by the British Commonwealth forces or the defeat of the Soviet Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about 5 km apart which were connected at intervals to create boxes which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts {{and the rest of the}} box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire. These became known as the Devil's gardens. The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least 2 km behind the second mine belt. The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly Teller anti-tank mines with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the S-mine). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians had a trick of dragging an <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.|$|R
50|$|The chassis and {{bodyshell}} {{were built}} at the Bean works in Tipton. There were three <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> eight <b>tyres.</b> The two leading <b>axles</b> steered <b>and</b> were of varying track, so that each tyre ran on a clean surface rather than following a rut. The driven rear axle used twin tyres to reduce the load on them, a technique already used by Bluebird. Separate panels of polished silver Birmabright, a new aluminium alloy, clad the chassis. The body never had the aerodynamic refinement of the Railton Special and was distinctly blocky in appearance. At the rear was a large triangular tailfin, flanked {{by a pair of}} hydraulically activated air brakes.|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{result of}} the AASHO-Road-Test is {{the rule of the}} fourth power. This research project attempts to determine a theoretical way that road damage progression is caused by a given traffic load impact by heavy vehicles. This requires data on the cumulative traffic load impact and the time variant strengh of bituminous and cement concrete, as well as the calculation of the roadway covering use which is relevant for the long term serviceability and the calculation of the damage progression. Axle load measurements were made at 124 locations by the Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen and were classified into seven load classes. First, these measurements have been analyzed based on records of <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> configurations <b>and</b> are then valued by the rule of the 1. to the 6. power. Beside the method that is based on the Gaussian normal distribution for the determination of the cumulative axle load distribution, two further proceedings were used. Furthermore, for a selected number of locations and pavement constructions the time dependent damage progressions caused by the actual existing heavy load traffic is calculated by two different methods. To do this one must determine the transverse stress {{at the bottom of the}} bituminous layers or cement pavements that is critical for the long term performance. This transverse stress is taken as a basis for further probabilistic studies. To take into account the mean variation of the transverse stress caused by the variation of slab thickness and of subbase stiffness, and by the dynamic axle-loading and the effects of <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> configuration, a variation coefficient of 20 % for asphalt bitumen layers and a variation coefficient of 30 % to 35 % for concrete pavements, which were the result of former research projects, are used. For determining the resistance the known time variant strength of bituminous and cement concrete and a variation coefficient of 10 % form the basis of the calculation of the damage progressions. For the first method, the design axle load of 10 tons and the affiliated load cycles calculated with the 1. to the 6. power are used for the calculation of the time variant probability of failure. Within the second method, the real number of <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> the equivalent standard axle load determinated with the 1. to the 6. power are appropriated for the calculation. By equating the results, a statement concerning the power, which is relevant for the damage progression, can be made. The data collected at a wealth of selected and heavy used road segments shows that the axle loads have to be valuated by the 3. to the 4. power in case of bituminous layers and by the 3. to the 5. power in case of cement pavements. This confirms the results of the AASHO-Road-Test. (orig.)

5000|$|The 4C employs double {{wishbone}} suspensions {{at the front}} and MacPherson struts at the rear. The resultant weight distribution is 38% {{on the front and}} 62% on the rear <b>axle.</b> [...] Wheels <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> have different diameters and widths front and rear: 205/45 R17 front and 235/40 R18 back as standard, with optional 205/40 R18 and 235/35 R19. Both wheel options come equipped with Pirelli P Zero tires. The 4C uses vented disc brakes on all wheels; Brembo 305 mm on the front and 292 mm on the rear. The car can stop from 100 km/h in 36 meters. To save weight and increase steering feel, the 4C has no power steering. Its center of gravity height is 40 cm; lower than the Lotus Elise.|$|R
40|$|Buses in Sweden {{have a low}} {{accident}} risk. However, {{statistics from}} 1996 - 2002 indicate {{that the number of}} bus accidents in Sweden with personal injuries have been increasing by 4 % yearly. Buses also have a higher percentage of accidents that occur on ice/snow covered roads than other vehicles. In Sweden passenger cars must be equipped with winter tyres during the winter period. There is no such regulation for heavy vehicles, and many buses are using summer tyres all around the year. The present project had the purpose of looking at the bus-winter problem in more detail, with the main focus on tyres. Four different studies were carried out: tyre tests, focus group discussions, driving simulator tests and an accident study. Here is given a short summary concerning methods and conclusions of each sub project. Tyre tests on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> non-studded winter <b>tyres,</b> while studded tyres exhibits a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests with driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> non-studded winter <b>tyres.</b> Also in these tests studded tyres were superior to non-studded. Accident statistics indicate that buses with summer tyres on the steering <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> winter <b>tyres</b> on the drive axle have the lowest estimated accident risk, which is in accordance with the results in a previous study. The results are however not statistically significant due the low number of accidents. Three focus groups were carried out and the importance of the tyres for traffic safety during winter was discussed. It is however hard from the gathered discussion material to estimate just how important the tyres really are. The results do not warrant a winter tyre regulation for heavy vehicles, and a restriction of the use of studded tyres for buses would probably have negative consequences on traffic safety...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that buses are overrepresented at {{accidents}} during winter road conditions compared to other vehicle types. Hence, the traffic safety of buses during the wintertime has been studied in more detail. The study comprised the following parts: - Gripping power studies on ice in VTI's tyre test facility. - Accident study and a survey of the use of tyre. - Focus group to gain knowledge about dangerous situations. - Driving simulator study to test the importance of the tyres during problematic situations. Tests in VTI's tyre test facility on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> non-studded winter <b>tyres,</b> while studded tyres exhibit a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests when driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> non-studded winter <b>tyres.</b> Also in these tests the studded tyres were superior to the non-studded. If studded tyres are used only on one axle, the driving simulator study showed that during side wind the ability to steer is important. The accident study showed that the buses that have summer tyres on the steering <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> winter <b>tyres</b> on the drivé axle has the lowest estimated accident risk, although it is not statistically significant. The buses equipped with studded tyres on both axles could not be statistically analysed since only 2 accidents occurred on bare roadways, and none on icy/snowy roadways, {{while at the same time}} the buses in this category drive a lot on icy/snowy roadways. This probably makes these buses the safest on winter roadways. From the focus groups it was clear that the time table has a great influence on the creating of stress and the demands on the drivers to keep the speed even during slippery roadways. Many bus drivers experience large problems with bad snow clearance, or other winter maintenance. At the same time there is a large consciousness among the drivers that it is always their own way of handling the vehicle that is the determining factor for traffic safety. The drivers were expressing a lack of further education and practical exercises with buses on slippery roads...|$|R
50|$|The B4's AWD layout is {{traditional}} Subaru. The viscous limited-slip centre coupling apportions front-to-rear torque 50:50. Torque distribution at the road, however, {{is dependent on}} load distribution <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip. As a result, the static straight driving ratio is 60:40 front-to-rear. Under dynamic driving conditions, however, the torque distribution varies accordingly. The viscous coupling senses rotational speed difference between the front <b>and</b> rear <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> transmits torque to the end with the most grip (which has lesser axle rpm).|$|R
5000|$|The Bedford HA was {{extremely}} popular with utility {{companies in the}} United Kingdom, particularly the Post Office, British Rail, electricity boards, British Telecom, and British Gas. Many other firms such as British European Airways, DER rental, and Meals on Wheels services had large fleets as well. It was the inspiration for Postman Pat's original van. It was originally available in 6 cwt and heavier duty 8 cwt models (payloads of [...] ), with the chassis codes HAE and HAV respectively. Gross vehicle weights were 2400 and 2615 lb respectively. The 8 cwt had a heavier rear <b>axle,</b> bigger <b>tyres,</b> <b>and</b> a sixth leaf in the rear springs. The 8 cwt was generally better equipped, offering a number of chromed trim parts (bumpers, mirrors, etcetera) and slightly plusher interior fittings. By 1971 the 6 cwt had been downgraded further yet, and now only came with a driver's seat as standard. Conversely, a fold-down rear seat was available as an option.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates passive vehicle {{suspensions}} with inerters {{by considering}} multiple performance requirements including ride comfort, suspension deflection <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip, where suspension deflection performance is novelly considered which is formulated {{as a part}} of objective functions and a constraint separately. Six suspension configurations are analyzed and the analytical solutions for each performance measure are derived. The conditions for each configuration to be strictly better than the simpler ones are obtained by presenting the analytical solutions of each configuration based on those of the simpler ones. Then, two stages of comparisons are given to show the performance limitations of suspension deflection for passive suspensions with inerters. In the first stage, it is shown that although the configurations with inerters can improve the mixed performance of ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip, the suspension deflection performance is significantly decreased simultaneously. In the second stage, it is shown that for passive suspensions with inerters, suspension deflection is the more basic limitation for both ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip performance by doing comparisons among mixed ride comfort and suspension deflection optimization, mixed ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip optimization, <b>and</b> mixed suspension deflection <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip optimization. Finally, the problem of mixed ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip performance optimization with equal suspension deflection is investigated. The limitations of suspension deflection for each configuration are further highlighted. <br/...|$|R
