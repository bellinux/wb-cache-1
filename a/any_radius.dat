40|$|We have {{examined}} the trend between CO and HI linewidths by compiling the linewidths of 219 nearby galaxies. The trend is that the CO linewidths of fast rotating galaxies tend to be larger than the HI linewidths, and that the HI linewidths of slow rotating galaxies tend to be larger than the CO linewidths, whereas the intermediately rotating galaxies have almost equal values. We have explained the trend using the synthetic rotation curve model, which provides the linewidth - absolute magnitude relations at <b>any</b> <b>radii,</b> {{and concluded that the}} trend has been occurred by the different distributions of CO and HI in a galaxy and the gradient of the rotation curves. The exact linewidth should be corrected for the effects of the gradient of the rotation curve and the gas distribution.

40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} the trend between CO and Hi linewidths by {{compiling}} the CO and Hi linewidths of 219 nearby galaxies. The trend is that the CO linewidths of fast rotating galaxies tend to be larger than the Hi linewidths, and that the Hi linewidths of slow rotating galaxies tend to be larger than the CO linewidths, whereas the intermediately rotating galaxies have almost equal values. We have examined the trend using the synthetic rotation curve model given by Persic et al. (1996), which provides the linewidth – absolute magnitude relations at <b>any</b> <b>radii.</b> We conclude that the trend is produced by the differences in CO and HI distributions in a galaxy and the gradient of a rotation curve {{that depends on the}} luminosity of the galaxy. We should note that the distribution of the tracer of linewidths (e. g. CO, Hi) and the gradient of rotation curves influence observed linewidths, therefore the exact linewidths should be corrected for them...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a topology control problem {{in which we}} are given a set of sensors in RdRd and we would like to assign a communication radius to each of them so that they generate a connected network and have low receiver-based interference (defined as the largest in-degree of the network). We show that <b>any</b> <b>radii</b> assignment that generates a connected network can be modified so that interference is (asymptotically) unaffected and no sensor is assigned communication radius larger than RminRmin, where RminRmin is the smallest possible radius needed to obtain strong connectivity. Combining this result with the previous network construction methods (see Halldórsson and Tokuyama (2008) [7] and von Rickenbach et al. (2009) [11]), we obtain a way to construct a connected network of low interference and bounded radii. Since the radius of a sensor is only affected by neighboring sensors, this construction can be done in a distributed fashion. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
