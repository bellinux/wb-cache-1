500|$|This album {{followed}} , {{which was}} released in 1998. Anthrax decided to sign with record label Nuclear Blast {{for the release of}} their upcoming album. Asked if changing the record company will affect the songwriting, guitarist Scott Ian replied: [...] "To be honest, I don't care about that at <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> business is business and the creative side is the creative side. Creatively, there was no big challenge. We just wanted {{to try to make the}} best record we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void {{is what you}} would make if you never got beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{taking the}} throne, William did not forget his nine {{surviving}} illegitimate children, creating {{his eldest son}} Earl of Munster and granting the other children the precedence of a younger son (or daughter) of a marquess. Despite this, his children importuned for greater opportunities, disgusting elements of the press who reported that the [...] "impudence and rapacity of the FitzJordans is unexampled". The relationship between William and his sons [...] "was punctuated {{by a series of}} savage and, for the King at least, painful quarrels" [...] over money and honours. His daughters, on the other hand, proved an ornament to his court, as, [...] "They are <b>all,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> pretty and lively, and make society in a way that real princesses could not." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we <b>all,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Lennon talked further {{about the}} song: [...] "'Yellow Submarine' is Paul's baby. Donovan {{helped with the}} lyrics. I helped with the lyrics too. We {{virtually}} made the track come alive in the studio, but based on Paul's inspiration. Paul's idea. Paul's title... written for Ringo." [...] Donovan added the words, [...] "Sky of blue and sea of green". McCartney also said: [...] "It's a happy place, that's <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> it was just... We were trying to write a children's song. That was the basic idea. And there's nothing more to be read into it than {{there is in the}} lyrics of any children's song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Returning to the stage, Connolly {{embarked}} on his Big Wee Tour of Britain, performing 69 dates in 84 days. While backstage in Brighton, he met Stephenson {{for a second}} time. He confided in {{her that he was}} unhappy and that his current marriage was over. Back at his hotel, where they began an affair, he reportedly drank thirty brandies. [...] "What I saw of him– particularly in that dressing room– was {{that he was about to}} die," [...] Stephenson said. [...] "He was very suicidal. He was throwing everything away, desperately trying to feel no pain at <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> how you get a sense from some people when they are very self-destructive that there is something they are trying to bury? They've got something they are trying to forget, or they are trying to drown their sorrows? He was hurting in a very deep way. I thought, 'If I leave this man, he's going to die.'" ...|$|E
