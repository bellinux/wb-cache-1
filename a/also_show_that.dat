5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{observations}} of the nearby SN PTF 11kx, discovered January 16, 2011 (UT) by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), lead {{to the conclusion that}} this explosion arises from single-degenerate progenitor, with a red giant companion, thus suggesting there is no single progenitor path to SN Ia. Direct {{observations of}} the progenitor of PTF11kx were reported in the August 24 edition of Science and support this conclusion, and <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the progenitor star experienced periodic nova eruptions before the supernova - another surprising discovery.|$|E

Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color}} of neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E
5|$|The records <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> part of {{the parish}} of Navenby was {{enclosed}} in 1772. Such was the significance of Navenby {{at this time that}} a workhouse for the parish poor was erected here, although the building was later given over to other uses. A Sick Society was founded in 1811 and a Parish School was built next to St Peter's Church in 1816, paid for by subscription. Following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act Navenby parish became {{part of the}} Lincoln Poor Law Union.|$|E

25|$|The {{eggs were}} {{incubated}} {{by the heat}} resulting from rotting vegetation placed into the nest by the parents, rather than a parent sitting on the nest. Upon hatching, fossils of baby Maiasaura show that their legs were not fully developed and thus they were incapable of walking.

25|$|The {{experiment}} of Frederick Thomas Trouton (1902). A condenser {{was brought}} parallel to Earth's motion, {{and it was}} assumed that momentum is produced when the condenser is charged. The negative result can be explained by Lorentz's theory, according to which the electromagnetic momentum compensates the momentum due to Earth's motion. Lorentz could <b>also</b> <b>show,</b> <b>that</b> the sensitivity of the apparatus was much too low to observe such an effect.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} that poisoning from hydrogen sulfide, anoxia, and hypercapnia acted {{together as a}} killing mechanism. Hypercapnia best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but anoxia and euxinia probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of anoxia through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).|$|E
25|$|The Negritos {{are likely}} {{descendants}} of the indigenous populations of the Sunda landmass and New Guinea, pre-dating the Mongoloid peoples who later entered Southeast Asia. Multiple studies <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Negritos from Southeast Asia to New Guinea share a closer cranial affinity with Australo-Melanesians. They were the ancestors of such tribes of the Philippines as the Aeta, Agta, Ayta, Ati, Dumagat and other similar groups. Today they comprise just 0.03% of the total Philippine population.|$|E
25|$|The hyphal sheath {{enveloping}} {{the root}} tips also {{acts as a}} physical barrier shielding plant tissues from pathogens and predators. Furthermore, there has been evidence suggesting that secondary metabolites of fungal partners are capable of acting as biochemical defense mechanisms against pathogenic fungi, nematodes and bacteria that may try to infect the mycorrhizal root.

25|$|The {{proof that}} τ is a vector space {{topology}} {{makes use of}} the assumption that each Xi is locally convex. By construction, β is a local base for τ. That any locally convex vector space topology on X must necessarily contain τ means it is the weakest one.

When each Xi is a Fréchet space, (X, τ) is called an LF space.|$|E
25|$|Most smokers begin smoking during {{adolescence}} or early adulthood. Some studies <b>also</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> smoking {{can also be}} linked to various mental health complications. Smoking has elements of risk-taking and rebellion, which often appeal to young people. The presence of peers that smoke and media featuring high-status models smoking may also encourage smoking. Because teenagers are influenced more by their peers than by adults, attempts by parents, schools, and health professionals at preventing people from trying cigarettes are often unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion polls}} have {{consistently}} {{shown that a}} majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

Former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.|$|E
