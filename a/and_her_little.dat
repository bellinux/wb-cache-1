Josemaria Escriva, founder of the then-new Opus Dei movement, had turned to the Daughters for Domestic Service for help in hiring {{household}} employees for a student dormitory he was opening called the Moncloa Residence. The Mother Superior of the Domestic Service Daughters recommended Dora, who happened to have some days off at the time. In spite of the low pay offered <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>little</b> desire to go, at the nun's insistence Dora agreed to help out the residence for a few days.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, Harte {{talked to}} various {{individuals}} {{who lived in}} the local area, finding that the monument was also known as [...] "Lady Williams and her Dog" [...] or [...] "Lady Williams <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>Little</b> Dog Fido", a reference to a family who lived at Bridehead House, Littlebredy. He also related a story that on 23 January 1985, a breakdown van was towing a car past the Nine Stones when, at 9:15pm, its engine cut out and the lights on both vehicles failed. Press coverage speculated that the event was linked to both a ley line passing through the site and to unidentified flying objects that have been reported above the nearby Eggardon Hill.|$|E
500|$|Brett Love of TV Squad, on {{the other}} hand, [...] " [...] short of calling [...] an {{excellent}} finale". While the deal's payoff was [...] "fantastic"—he was surprised by Dean's death, and looked forward to its implications for the fourth season—Love was slightly disappointed with Lilith. McCormick [...] "impressed" [...] him as Lilith, {{but he did not}} find her as [...] "menacing and scary" [...] as Fredric Lehne's Azazel. The villain's storyline of terrorizing a family would have made a [...] "great regular episode", but was not epic enough for a finale. Diana Steenbergen of IGN felt the scenes of Lilith's shore leave briefly [...] " [...] the episode down" [...] because the viewers [...] "understood the situation quickly enough". She otherwise liked the episode, and gave it a score of 8.9 out of 10. Steenbergen enjoyed the [...] "first-rate brotherly scenes", and was happy that the series followed through with its promise of sending Dean to Hell, commenting that the related hellhound attack was [...] "one of the scariest things the show has done yet". Like Charles, she applauded the acting, noting that [...] "we feel [...] fear as the deadline approaches". She went on to write that Padalecki's [...] "best moments are in the barely contained rage at his inability to save his brother, and in his grief at losing Dean", while [...] "Lilith <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>little</b> girl mannerisms in Ruby's body were far more chilling, and interesting, than Ruby's tough chick persona ever has been".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 2, 1910. It states: [...] "Walter North is a New York man, married to a Southern girl. At {{the opening of the}} play their baby daughter is christened, and the young couple is living happily in their home in Baltimore. This is in 1861, the opening of the Civil War. At the first rumors of hostilities, Mrs. North's brother enlisted in the ranks of the Confederacy. When North refuses to follow his example, and casts his lot with the Union army, his wife bids him good-bye forever. She asked him to choose between his flag and her. He salutes Old Glory, and goes to war. Four years later when he returns he finds his old home deserted, and although he tries in every way to discover the whereabouts of his wife and child he is unsuccessful. He moves to a northern home and there becomes commander of [...] GAR post. Mrs. North, who believed that her husband was killed in the war, comes North with her brother <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>little</b> grandchild to attend the reunion of the Confederate veterans and the GAR. While out working with her grandmother, the little girl is lost, and is picked up by North on his way to attend the reunion. Through the police the grandmother and uncle are notified of the whereabouts of the child, and when they come to claim her at the GAR post, there are mutual recognitions, and Mr. and Mrs. North are reunited. There is but one flag now, the blue and the gray clasp hands beneath its folds." ...|$|E
