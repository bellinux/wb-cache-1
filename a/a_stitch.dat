5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having <b>a</b> <b>stitch,</b> a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the realm}} of tie-in {{speculative}} fiction, {{there was also an}} increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed Star Trek literature. In the , the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, <b>A</b> <b>Stitch</b> in Time, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, The Crimson Shadow. In the original series , created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> zigzag <b>stitch</b> is <b>a</b> variant {{geometry}} of the lockstitch. It is <b>a</b> back-and-forth <b>stitch</b> used where <b>a</b> straight <b>stitch</b> will not suffice, such as in preventing raveling of <b>a</b> fabric, in <b>stitching</b> stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} {{different}} ways to insert the needle into the stitch. Knitting through the front of <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> is called Western knitting. Going {{through the back of}} <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> is called Eastern knitting. A third method, called combination knitting, goes through the front of a knit stitch and the back of a purl stitch.|$|E

25|$|A {{person who}} creates a design {{is known as}} an {{embroidery}} digitizer or puncher. A digitizer uses software to create an object-based embroidery design, which can be easily reshaped and edited. These files retain important information such as object outlines, thread colors, and original artwork used to punch the designs. When the file is converted to <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> file, it loses much of this information, rendering editing difficult or impossible.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} not enough {{evidence}} to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics {{to reduce the risk of}} preterm birth. In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. Likewise, putting <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "This Charming Man" [...] {{comprise}} a first person narrative {{in which the}} male protagonist punctures one of his bicycle's wheels on a remote hillside. A passing [...] "charming man" [...] in a luxury car stops to offer the cyclist a lift, and although the protagonist is at first hesitant, after much deliberation he accepts the offer. While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: [...] "I would go out tonight, but I haven't got <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> to wear". The motorist tells the cyclist: [...] "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care".|$|E

50|$|In {{securing}} the previous <b>stitch</b> in <b>a</b> wale, the next stitch can {{pass through the}} previous loop either from below or above. If the former, the stitch is denoted as <b>a</b> knit <b>stitch</b> or <b>a</b> plain stitch; if the latter, as <b>a</b> purl <b>stitch.</b> The two stitches are related in that <b>a</b> knit <b>stitch</b> seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as <b>a</b> purl <b>stitch</b> on the other side.|$|R
500|$|In January 1964, and in {{the absence}} of any other information, Macleod now editor of The Spectator, used the pretext of a review of a book by Randolph Churchill to {{publicise}} his own different and very detailed version of the leadership election. [...] He described the [...] "soundings" [...] of five Tory grandees, four of whom, like Home and Macmillan had been to school at Eton, as <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> up by an Etonian [...] "magic circle". The article received wide publicity convincing Anthony Howard, who later declared himself [...] "deeply affronted ... and never more affronted than when Alec Douglas-Home became leader of the Conservative Party".|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> may be {{deliberately}} left unsecured {{by a new}} stitch and its wale {{allowed to}} disassemble. [...] This is known as drop-stitch knitting, and produces a vertical ladder of see-through holes in the fabric, corresponding to where the wale had been.|$|E

2500|$|The word crochet {{is derived}} from the Old French crochet, a {{diminutive}} of croche, in turn from the Germanic croc, both meaning [...] "hook". It was used in 17th-century French lace making, crochetage designating <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> used to join separate pieces of lace, and crochet subsequently designating both a specific type of fabric and the hooked needle used to produce it. Although the fabric is not known to be crochet in the present sense, a genealogical relationship between the techniques sharing that name appears likely.|$|E
50|$|This is an off-loom {{technique}} perfected by the Native Americans. It is {{a relative}} of another off-loom technique called Peyote stitch or Gourd <b>Stitch.</b> <b>A</b> Brick <b>Stitch</b> pattern can be worked as <b>a</b> Peyote <b>Stitch</b> Pattern if turned through 90 degrees.|$|R
25|$|Knitting can be {{accomplished}} by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand. The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: <b>a</b> single crochet <b>stitch</b> is twice the height of <b>a</b> knit <b>stitch</b> in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and <b>a</b> double crochet <b>stitch</b> is about four times the height of <b>a</b> knit <b>stitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{surviving}} European samplers {{were made}} in the 16th and 17th centuries. As there were few pre-printed patterns available for needleworkers, <b>a</b> <b>stitched</b> model was needed. Whenever a needlewoman saw a new and interesting example of <b>a</b> <b>stitching</b> pattern, she would quickly sew a small sample of it onto a piece of cloth - her 'sampler'. The patterns were sewn randomly onto the fabric as a reference for future use, and the woman would collect extra stitches and patterns throughout her lifetime.|$|R
2500|$|In London on 22 April 2007, Haile {{challenged}} the 2006 London Marathon winner Felix Limo, 2005 London Marathon winner Martin Lel, 2004 Athens gold medalist Stefano Baldini, 2006 New York Marathon winner Marílson Gomes dos Santos, and the then marathon world record holder Paul Tergat in what organizers anticipated {{would be an}} exciting race. However Haile dropped out at the [...] stage complaining of <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> and inability to breathe, {{which turned out to}} be an allergic reaction to the pollen in the air. This left the 2005 winner Martin Lel to come home in first place.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his student}} years, Hopper's nudes were all women. Unlike past artists who painted the female nude to glorify the female form and to {{highlight}} female eroticism, Hopper's nudes are solitary {{women who are}} psychologically exposed. One audacious exception is Girlie Show (1941), where a red-headed strip-tease queen strides confidently across a stage {{to the accompaniment of}} the musicians in the pit. Girlie Show was inspired by Hopper's visit to a burlesque show a few days earlier. Hopper's wife, as usual, posed for him for the painting, and noted in her diary, [...] "Ed beginning a new canvas—a burlesque queen doing a strip tease—and I posing without <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> on in front of the stove—nothing but high heels in a lottery dance pose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not every stitch {{in a row}} need be knitted; {{some may}} be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a {{subsequent}} row. This is known as slip-stitch knitting. [...] The slipped stitches are naturally longer than the knitted ones. For example, <b>a</b> <b>stitch</b> slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts. [...] This can produce interesting visual effects, although the resulting fabric is more rigid because the slipped stitch 'pulls' on its neighbours and is less deformable. Mosaic knitting {{is a form of}} slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as Fair-Isle knitting.|$|E
