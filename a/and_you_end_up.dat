500|$|FLCL has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it [...] "downright hilarious" [...] and [...] "visually superb" [...] with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD {{as the only}} weakness of Synch-Point's original release. Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "FLCL {{may not have a}} straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!" [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life." [...] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, [...] "It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation." ...|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 Vanity Fair interview, Vilanch {{was asked}} {{for whom he}} wrote the Oscars show jokes, replying: [...] "I write across the board. Every year it breaks down differently, {{depending}} on the host, but as we {{get closer to the}} date, all of the writers tend to be writing over each other. Everyone's contributing to everybody else's work. There are four of us writing the actual show, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> writing and rewriting so many things at the same time. So I do a little of everything. There's a lot of mileage involved in writing for the Academy Awards, you go through a lot of hoops." [...] When asked if he could see himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: [...] "Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth. It's like asking somebody, 'Hey, would you like to play in the Super Bowl next year?' Did anybody get into football not to play in the Super Bowl? Does anybody get into show business not to do the biggest show in the world?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Strangers are energy {{beings who}} reside in dead human bodies. When design first started, the filmmakers {{considered}} having the Strangers be bugs underneath but {{decided that the}} bug appearance was overused. Tatopoulos said Proyas {{wanted to make the}} Strangers energy beings, [...] "Alex called me and said he wanted something like an energy that kept re-powering itself, re-creating itself, re-shaping itself, sitting inside a dry piece of human shape." [...] The Strangers reside in a large underground amphitheater for their lair, where a human bust hides a large clock and a spiraling device changes the layout of the city above. The set for the lair was fifty feet (15 m) in height, where an average set is thirty-six feet (11 m). The lair set was built on a fairground in Sydney, Australia. The film's budget was $30–40 million, so the crew used inexpensive techniques to design the set, such as stretching canvas onto welded metal frames. The lair also had a rail conveyance that appeared expensive. Tatopoulos said, [...] "We had, obviously, a car built, but we had just one built. [...] We laid some rail for it to ride on. We made a section of corridor that we kept driving through all the time, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> believing this thing is running along forever." [...] Proyas originally wanted the rail car to roll by various rooms, which was not feasible for the budget, so Tatopoulos and the crew used [...] "replaceable elements and strong design textures" [...] to mimic the impression of various rooms.|$|E
5000|$|When Bowie {{performed}} {{the song in}} 1996 he described it as [...] "full of remorse and agony, I expect, it's when jobs go wrong, and home doesn't really feel warm anymore, and you don't need anybody - you don't even pretend you do - <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> {{in this kind of}} state." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shehzaan Abdulla from Continue-Play {{gave it a}} {{score of}} 8/10 and said, [...] "Balancing in-jokes and fan service with humble, down-to-earth {{storytelling}} isn’t easy. Go too far in one direction <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with a hokey, pandering mess; go too far in the other, {{and you have a}} feature that feels disconnected, and uninspired by the source material.

50|$|He often {{worked with}} {{director}} Richard Franklin who said of him:Everett {{is a very}} inspirational writer... Everett gives one too much of everything and you don’t always know what to use. You start editing down <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with words and single lines of dialogue that were once scenes. That is maybe how this problem, as you see it, comes about.

5000|$|In November 1987 Carne told Karen Middleton of The Canberra Times of his {{disappointment}} in their record company's choice of producers for Terrain and their previous management, [...] "we could've basically produced the album ourselves and probably done an equally good or better job, but unfortunately record companies want names of producers {{on the album}} ... and the guys we're dealing with on our level ... are just really average <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> doing the job anyway".|$|E

500|$|... "The List" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics.

He felt that [...] "The List" [...] embodied a bland stand-alone X-Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script, with [...] "attempts at drama" [...] that had no depth, and [...] "sideplots [...] have so {{little effect on the}} main narrative as to be basically padding".

Manniac's effects were also given mild praise by Independent Flicks, which criticized every other aspect of the film, and gave it an overall score of 1/7. A zero was awarded by Forced Viewing, which summed up its thoughts regarding Manniac with, [...] "The effects are really cheap and cheesy and that is pretty much fine for me, except that you combine that with really poor acting and boring as dirt sex scenes <b>and</b> all <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with is a really sad combination of sex and violence.

Normally when you get oversteer you can control it but the Benetton would go very suddenly <b>and</b> so <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> having a spin. I had big problems with that car." [...] Schumacher's unusual driving style, based on his extraordinary feel for a car's performance made development for the B194 extremely limited; this gave him an advantage over his teammates.

She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her."
