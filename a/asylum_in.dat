5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request <b>asylum</b> <b>in</b> the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought <b>asylum</b> <b>in</b> the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E

They advocated the viewing of mental illness as a disorder that required compassionate treatment that would aid in the rehabilitation of the victim. The arrival in the Western world of institutionalisation {{as a solution to}} the problem of madness was very much an event of the nineteenth century. [...] The first public mental <b>asylums</b> were established <b>in</b> Britain; the passing of the County Asylums Act 1808 empowered magistrates to build rate-supported <b>asylums</b> <b>in</b> every county to house the many 'pauper lunatics'. Nine counties first applied, the first public <b>asylum</b> opening <b>in</b> 1812 in Nottinghamshire. In 1828, the newly appointed Commissioners in Lunacy were empowered to license and supervise private asylums. The Lunacy Act 1845 made the construction of <b>asylums</b> <b>in</b> every country compulsory with regular inspections on behalf of the Home Secretary. The Act required asylums to have written regulations and to have a resident physician.|$|R
