Space credits are used between missions in order to purchase special abilities and bonuses for modules, while gaining reputation unlocks new modules.|$|E
25|$|The South Korea government's Board of Audit and Inspection {{revealed}} that the Korean Register's licensing was based on falsified documents. After the incident, the company reported that the ship was carrying 124 cars, 56 trucks, and 1157 tons of cargo. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> carried was twice the legal limit.|$|E
25|$|The first twelve cargo {{transport}} flights {{contracted to}} NASA were done at one time, so no price change is reflected for the v1.1 launches {{as opposed to}} the v1.0 launches.

The new company, JIT-Trans, was established on 1 May 1988.|$|E
25|$|Ports in the Persian Gulf were {{overwhelmed}} by the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> arriving from allied countries, and so John W. Brown was forced to lie at anchor for a month until she could begin to unload at Abadan, Iran, where she dropped off the two P-40s {{and some of the}} tanks in late January 1943. It took another month and a half until she could enter port at Khorramshahr, Iran, and unload the rest of her cargo in March 1943.|$|E
25|$|After initial {{issues were}} solved, the Finnpusku system was found {{out to be}} {{suitable}} for the transportation needs of Rautaruukki in both port-to-port transport and lightening large bulk carriers outside the port of Raahe.

50|$|While {{the project}} was an {{operational}} secret {{in the guise of}} a warehouse, according to a statement of a local Japanese labourer, rumors were rife in the surrounding villages and towns that the emperor was coming to town.

25|$|For {{all of the}} {{advantages}} of a small ship, there were drawbacks that could sway captains to look to larger vessels. A sloop or a ship of similar size could not carry a large enough crew to take on bigger prizes by boarding and couldn't carry enough firepower to force submission or fight it out with larger foes; it was also limited in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> it could carry. In terms of firepower, anything the size of a sloop would not carry more than fourteen guns, with the French sloop's carrying six guns or less. Conversely some of the largest pirate ships like Bartholomew Roberts flagship the Royal Fortune sported forty-two guns.|$|E
25|$|British Dakota and Hastings {{aircraft}} carrying essential {{goods and}} raw materials began using Tegel {{on a regular basis}} from 17 November 1948. Regular cargo flights with American C-54s followed from 14 December 1948. Generally, the former carried food and fuel while the latter were loaded with coal. December 1948 also saw three Armée de l'Air Junkers Ju 52/3m transport planes participating in the airlift for the first time. However, the Armée de l'Air contributed to the overall airlift effort in a very small and symbolic way only. As a result of committing the small French transport fleet to the growing war effort in Indochina, as well as the joint Anglo-American decision to employ only four-engined planes {{for the remainder of the}} airlift to increase the number of flights and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> carried on each flight by taking advantage of those aircraft's higher speeds and greater capacities, the French participation ceased.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} in {{the timing of the}} transportation needs of Rautaruukki and Finnlines the time-chartering of the second pusher did not fulfill the requirements of the steel company's raw material supply schedule. It was decided to transfer the ownership of the pusher Finn and barges Baltic, Board and Bulk to new joint shipping companies owned by Rautaruukki Oy (95%) and Oy JIT-Trans Ltd (5%). Once all vessels were under the control of a single company, these issues disappeared and the Finnpusku system was found out to be suitable for the transportation needs of Rautaruukki in both port-to-port transport and lightening large bulk carriers outside the port of Raahe. By the end of 1987 the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> transported by the Finnpusku system, 7.5 million tons per year, had grown beyond the capability of the transportation department that was under the central administration of the steel company, so on 1 May 1988 a subsidiary company, JIT-Trans, was established to deal with both the parent company's own cargoes and external shipping business.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1840s, {{the economy}} was {{improving}} vastly and the manufacturing industries were once again growing.

25|$|This {{led to the}} {{question}} as to where these pods should be located. An obvious solution would be to load them into the aircraft's huge fuselage. However, this would require the nose or tail to open, adding some complexity. It was noticed early on that it could be loaded much faster if the cargo was placed under the wings instead; the cargo containers could be driven up to either side of the aircraft at the same time. As soon as this was considered another major advantage became clear; by locating the pods closer to the landing gear, the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> that could be carried was dramatically increased. This allowed the gear to be placed on the wings as on traditional designs, instead of the complex fuselage-mounted systems normally found on heavy lifters. This led to a further modification by placing two sets of gear on either side of each cargo pod, for a total of eight sets of main landing gear, further spreading out the loads.|$|E

[...] However, a station reported winds of 23mph (37km/h) six hours after Lester passed over Socorro Island. Several ships {{came in contact with}} Lester, with one in the eye reporting hurricane-force winds for 11hours on August 22. The ship in the eye reported rough seas, causing it to roll 33° to each side and thus was responsible for a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> to go overboard.|$|E

The port was finished and first opened in 1909 and had adequate facilities for that time, with 6 storage basins, a number of oil reservoirs, and grain silos. With these facilities, the port operated 1.4 million tons of cargo in 1911.

500|$|The {{majority}} of resupply by sea {{was conducted by}} cargo ships of the US Army and US Navy. The massive demand for ships forced the UN Command to charter private ships and bring ships out of the reserve fleet to augment the military vessels in service. The UN had a major advantage in its sealift operations in that the most developed port in Korea was Pusan which was at the southeastern tip of the peninsula. Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> Its four piers and intervening quays could berth 24 or more deepwater ships, and its beaches provided space for the unloading of 14 Landing Ship Tank (LST) vessels, giving the port a potential capacity of [...] daily.

Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> An emergency airlift of critically needed items began almost immediately from the United States to Japan. Although it did not fly into Korea, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after the outbreak of the war. The consumption of aviation gasoline thanks to both combat and transport aircraft was so great in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it became one of the serious logistical problems. From Pusan a good railroad system built by the Japanese extended northward. The railroads were the backbone of the UN transportation system in Korea. The [...] of Korean vehicular roads were all of a secondary nature, as measured by American or European standards.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was converted}} from a Hamilcar Mark I. Two Bristol Mercury radial piston engines, {{capable of producing}} 965hp, {{were added to the}} wings of the glider, and the wings and fuselage were strengthened so they could take the weight of the engines. Extra controls were added to the cockpit and duplicated in the two pilot positions, although space restrictions meant that the glider could only be started from the rear seat, and fuel tanks were added to the wings, with the possibility of a third being carried in the fuselage. These additions increased the glider's weight to , but its other dimensions remained unchanged, including the carrying capacity in the fuselage. The first flight of the Mark X, under its own power, took place in February 1945 and the initial flight and further trials showed that the glider operated as had been expected. With engines installed, a Mark X could be towed by a fully loaded Halifax and achieve an operational radius of approximately [...] However, if the glider itself was fully loaded and took off on its own power, it was discovered that it could not maintain height even at full power; this resulted in a decision to decrease the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> it could carry under its own power, which in turn decreased its weight to [...] Two Hamilcar Mark Is were converted for initial trials, and when these proved satisfactory a further eight Mark Is were converted and ten Mark Xs built from scratch; any further orders were cancelled when the conflict ended in August 1945, although further tests were conducted in the United States. One other Hamilcar variant was proposed, although it never went into production or appeared to go further than the design stage. This was a proposal to mate a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter {{to the top of a}} Hamilcar, as the fighter would provide enough power to keep both aircraft in flight and relieve the glider pilots of the task of controlling the glider until it cast off to land.|$|E
