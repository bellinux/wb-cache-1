5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E

50|$|The Domesday Book {{records that}} by 1086 Cogges had a water mill, presumably on the River Windrush. For {{much of its}} history Cogges had two water mills: one at the {{southern}} tip of the parish and the other north of the Priory. The southern mill was originally called Gold Mill, and its name evolved by 1279 to Gill Mill. By 1670 Gill Mill was being used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fulling</b> mill and in 1702 and 1712 there were two fulling mills on the site. The last known record of Gill Mill being in operation is from about 1803. The northern mill existed by 1272 and was being used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fulling</b> mill by 1387. It was still in operation in 1702 but had fallen out of use by 1704.|$|R
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved on to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E
5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> member.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Frederick II, Kronborg Castle was {{designed}} by two Flemish architects, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen who started the work in 1574 and Anthonis van Obbergen who finished it in 1585.

5|$|Each {{member of}} a {{respective}} nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each {{member of a}} particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The combination of the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E

Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself had lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E
