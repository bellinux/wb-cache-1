25|$|One of {{the male}} protagonists of NOW. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>person</b> at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a {{traumatic}} incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu's secrets upon his swordmaster's last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother's sword that left the scar on his cheek. Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book {{with the purpose of}} changing the world so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha's style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran's ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, willing to do anything to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran.|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while she may be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person,</b> she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person,</b> nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person.</b> The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's so many ways to go with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time.

Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person,</b> it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E

The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: [...] "I can't see a good life while there are people living like animals.

[...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person</b> [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrasting}} Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different {{conflicts and}} anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite {{at the home}} of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not. According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA, leading him to question whether he is essentially <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>person</b> or not, and what his future holds for him. These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron, and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them, saying, [...] "You are just like me" [...] to Miles before dying.|$|E
