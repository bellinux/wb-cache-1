5|$|Isabeau was popularly {{seen as a}} spendthrift <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> philanderess. In {{the late}} 20th and early 21st centuries historians re-examined the {{extensive}} chronicles of her lifetime, concluding that many elements of her reputation were unearned and stemmed from factionalism and propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|The local {{branch of}} the TGWU refused {{to meet with a}} {{delegation}} from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter war of words was fought out in the local media. Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union, persuaded a local black TGWU member, Bill Smith, to sign a statement which called for quiet negotiation to solve the dispute. It condemned Stephenson for causing potential harm to the city's black and Asian population. Nethercott launched an attack on Stephenson in the Daily Herald newspaper, calling him dishonest <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible.</b> This led to a libel case in the High Court, which awarded Stephenson damages and costs in December 1963.|$|E

5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible.</b> At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|The popular view of Richard {{has more}} than {{anything}} been influenced by Shakespeare's play about the king, Richard II. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until Henry VII's accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was {{to blame for the}} later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.|$|E
5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible.</b> Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as he always did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before dawn, Indian {{security}} forces began {{an attack on}} Nariman House that lasted until after sundown. The operation began when 22 NSG Commandos rappelled out from an Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopter {{on the roof of}} the building. NSG Commandos were in position in the adjacent buildings to provide cover fire to the assault team if needed. Commandos entered the building from the top and two loud blasts were heard followed by heavy gunfire. Most of the operation was broadcast live on television as news footage showed troops abseiling from a helicopter into the building and soldiers on the ground closing in. Initially it was reported that five hostages were killed, but it was later upgraded to six deaths, eight by Saturday morning after two missing Israelis made contact with the Israeli Foreign Ministry. When the raid ended at sundown everyone inside the building was dead, including the rabbi and his wife. An Indian commando, Havaldar Gajendra Singh Bisht, was killed during the operation. According to ZAKA members, at least one hostage, Holtzberg, might have been killed in the crossfire when the commandos moved in; this was rejected by government authorities as stories <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> comments.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Adrian Stokes of yellow fever in September 1927, it became {{increasingly}} evident that yellow fever {{was caused by a}} virus, not by the bacillus Leptospira icteroides, as Noguchi believed. Feeling his reputation was at stake, Noguchi hastened to Lagos to carry out additional research. However, he found the working conditions in Lagos did not suit him. At the invitation of Dr. William Alexander Young, the brilliant young director of the British Medical Research Institute, Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), he moved to Accra and made this his base in 1927. However, Noguchi proved a very difficult guest and by May 1928 Young regretted his invitation. Noguchi was secretive and volatile, working almost entirely at night to avoid contact with fellow researchers. The diaries of Oskar Klotz, another researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation, describe Noguchi’s temper and behavior as erratic and bordering on the paranoid. His methods were haphazard. According to Klotz, he inoculated huge numbers of monkeys with yellow fever, but failed to keep proper records. He may have believed himself immune to yellow fever, having been inoculated with a vaccine of his own development. Possibly his erratic <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> behavior was caused by the untreated syphilis with which he was diagnosed in 1913, and which may have progressed to neurosyphilis. In any case, he was careless not only of his own safety, but also of the safety of those around him. Despite repeated promises to Young, Noguchi failed to keep infected mosquitoes in their specially designed secure housing. In May 1928, having failed to find evidence for his theories, Noguchi was set to return to New York, but was taken ill in Lagos. He boarded his ship to sail home, but on 12 May was put ashore at Accra and taken to a hospital with yellow fever. After lingering for some days, he died on 21 May.|$|E
500|$|Caragiale {{showed little}} {{surprise}} at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable <b>and</b> <b>irresponsible</b> kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E
