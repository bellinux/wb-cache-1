40|$|High Gradient Furnace with Quench (HGFQ) {{is being}} {{developed}} to facilitate metals processing experiments aboard the International Space Station. The sample is centered in an <b>annular</b> <b>furnace</b> and is held fixed during processing. The furnace itself is made to translate over the sample. Once in process, heat will flow through the sample from the Heater Zone to the Chill Zone. If operating conditions are correct, the solidification interface will stand in the gradient zone. Objectives of the HGFQ process are to provide a high gradient for the solidification with the solidification interface properly positioned in the gradient zone. At the recent RDR for HGFQ, one of the panelists raised {{the question about the}} suitability of HGFQ for potential future PIs. Specifically, it was stated by the design team at RDR that the present HGFQ design would provide a radius of curvature of the solidification interface of at least one sample diameter. The RDR panel argued that this was too small, and that most investigators would need a radius of curvature larger than this. The requirements established by the current PIs are shown. These requirements do not contain any specification about the interface shape. However, these requirements do define the envelope of operational parameters for HGFQ. The objectives of the present investigation are to 1) determine a suitable means of quantifying the interface shape, and 2) investigate the interface shape and how it is affected by processing parameters. The processing parameters to be considered are 1) sample material, 2) sample diameter, and 3) gradient zone length...|$|E
40|$|<b>Annular</b> <b>furnaces</b> have multivariate, nonlinear, large time lag, {{and cross}} {{coupling}} characteristics. The prediction {{and control of}} the exit temperature of a tube billet are important but difficult. We establish a prediction model for the final temperature of a tube billet through OS-ELM-DRPLS method. We address the complex production characteristics, integrate the advantages of PLS and ELM algorithms in establishing linear and nonlinear models, and consider model update and data lag. Based on the proposed model, we design a prediction control algorithm for tube billet temperature. The algorithm is validated using the practical production data of Baosteel Co., Ltd. Results show that the model achieves the precision required in industrial applications. The temperature of the tube billet can be controlled within the required temperature range through compensation control method...|$|R
