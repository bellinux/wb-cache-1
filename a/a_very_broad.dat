5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|The French tanks had heavier armour and {{armament}} {{than the}} Panzers. The Panzer IV had 30mm of armour, while the Hotchkiss had 45mm, and the Char B1 had 60mm of protection. Moreover, its main armament, one 47mm and one 75mm gun, outmatched all the German tanks. In {{an open field}} engagement, Guderian's armour stood little chance. Two-thirds of his units were equipped with Panzer I and IIs. Just 30 of the Panzer IVs were on his order of battle. However, one crucial disadvantage of the French tanks, considered as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> whole, was their low endurance. They needed refuelling after just two hours. They were also slow in speed, complicating high tempo operations.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

40|$|New {{observations}} of the broad-line quasar PG 1416 - 129 reveal a large decline in its continuum luminosity {{over the past ten}} years. In response to the continuum change the ``classical'' broad component of Hbeta has almost completely disappeared (a x 10 decrease in flux). In its place there remains <b>a</b> redshifted/redward asymmetric <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> emission line component. The significance of this change is multifold: (1) It confirms the existence of <b>a</b> distinct redshifted <b>Very</b> <b>Broad</b> Line Region (VBLR) component that persists after the demise of the broad component and that is frequently observed, along with the broad component, in radio-loud sources. (2) The smaller (x 2) intensity change in the Hbeta <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> component supports the previously advanced idea that the VBLR is physically distinct and likely to arise in an optically thin region close to the central source. (3) The presence of <b>a</b> strong <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> component in the radio-quiet quasar PG 1416 - 129 reinforces the notion that such ``population B'' quasars share similar spectroscopic (and hence geometrical and kinematical) properties to radio-loud sources. (4) AGN can show <b>broad,</b> <b>very</b> <b>broad,</b> or both line components simultaneously, making statistical comparisons of source profile widths difficult. (5) The interpretation, in reverberation studies, of the presence or lack of correlated response in broad line wings will be affected by this composite BLR/VBLR structure.
