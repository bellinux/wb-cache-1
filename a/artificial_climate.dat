40|$|Mechanization and {{industrialization}} {{of society}} {{has resulted in}} most people spending {{the greater part of}} their lives in enclosed environments. Optimal design of indoor <b>artificial</b> <b>climates</b> is therefore of increasing importance. Wherever <b>artificial</b> <b>climates</b> are created for human occupation, the aim is that the environment be designed so that individuals are in thermal comfort. Current design methodologies for radiant panel heating systems do not adequately account for the complexities of human thermal comfort, because they monitor air temperature alone and do not account for thermal neutrality in complex enclosures. Thermal comfort for a person is defined as that condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. Thermal comfort is dependent on Mean Radiant Temperature and Operative Temperature among other factors. In designing <b>artificial</b> <b>climates</b> for human occupancy the interaction of the human with the heated surfaces as well the surface-to-surface heat exchange must be accounted for. Early work in the area provided an elaborate and difficult method for calculating radiant heat exchange for simplistic and orthogonal enclosures. A new improved method developed by the authors for designing radiant panel heating systems based on human thermal comfort and mean radiant temperature is presented. Through automation and elaboration this method overcomes the limitations of the early work. The design procedure accounts for human thermal comfort in nonorthogonal as well as orthogonal spaces based on mean radiant temperature prediction. The limitation of simplistic orthogonal geometries has been overcome with the introduction of the MRT-Correction method and inclined surface-to-person shape factor methodology. The new design method increases the accuracy of calculation and prediction of human thermal comfort and will allow designers to simulate complex enclosures utilizing the latest design knowledge of radiant heat exchange to increase human thermal comfor...|$|R

These techniques were selected from the supply of available vapor deposition methods. The results obtained from aviation relevant materials (Al alloys, Ti alloys, staining and stainless steels) using the deposition methods IBAD, magnetron sputtering and arc deposition permit the following conclusions: In general, vapor deposited aluminum coatings with additions of Mg, Li, etc., substituting Cadmium/Chromium, are suitable for corrosion control of steels; using CrN or AlN as additional topcoat also ensures a good friction characteristic or simultaneous wearing protection; hardcoatings, in particular those containing carbon, on stainless steels and titanium alloys are resistant to <b>artificial</b> <b>climates</b> and offer very high wearing protection. In contact with aluminum, however, they lead to increased corrosion depending on their carbon content.

40|$|Interior {{architecture}} today {{seems to}} be undergoing a process of radical transformation; its horizons have broadened beyond measure, its influence spreading well beyond its own borders to penetrate the processes of urban growth. The customary hierarchical ordering of indoors and out, public and private, building and city has been overturned in a role reversal which we see giving rise to a polyvalent, unspecialized territory in which functions are not fixed once for all time. Thus interior architecture has lost its disciplinary specificity and takes on a new, more general condition of “indoor-hood”. That, then, is the stance of the essays in this paper; they try to place themselves outside the tradition of architecture as metaphor for history, seeking only to give some partial responses to an urban condition no longer defined by its morphological arrangement alone (distribution and positioning of services), but reconfigured as heterogeneous, transversal, multidisciplinary, diffuse, inward-turning and sometimes even intangible, with its corresponding specialist uses, perceptual stage-scaffolding, information networks, <b>artificial</b> <b>climates,</b> sales pitches, communication systems, &c. – all aspects contained within architecture, but not easily described using architecture’s own formal codes.

Generally, the refrigerator is used to decrease temperature to simulate outdoor environment, while a heater is used to increase the temperature to simulate the indoor environment. It would result in large waste if the temperature control method of <b>artificial</b> <b>climate</b> room is unreasonable. It causes energy waste because it takes too much time for control process stability, which is caused by the characteristics of controlled objects such as lagging, inertia and uncertainty. Thus it is necessary to design more reasonable control methods for energy conservation. The cooling capacity for simulating outdoor temperature varies widely, so multiform controlling means is adopted, such as frequency control for the refrigerator, on/off control and auxiliary heater. While the thermal chamber which is used for simulating indoor temperature is on a long-time delay, large inertia (forced disturb is not allowed), and a new type of immune controller is designed by learning from the functions of self-adjustment, antigen memory and immunity response in biology immunity systems. By the control method, it gets a smaller overshoot and a quicker response speed in the practical process of temperature control of an <b>artificial</b> <b>climate</b> room; thus it is considered to be an optimum energy conservation method.

40|$|Background and Aims: Comparative {{studies of}} closely related taxa can {{increase}} understanding of adaptations {{and changes in}} seed dormancy and germination preferences in an evolutionary perspective. For such studies, a method to describe and compare the performance of taxa {{in a general way}} is needed. The germination ecology of four Papaver taxa was studied with the aim of describing and comparing their responses to different seasonal temperature regimes. Methods: Germination of Papaver argemone, P. rhoeas, P. dubium ssp. dubium and P. dubium ssp. lecoqii was investigated in three different <b>artificial</b> <b>climates</b> over 2. 5 years. Seeds were collected in southern Sweden, and samples from different populations were used as replicates of taxa. Key Results: Despite substantial intra-taxa variation, there were clear taxon-specific responses. Most germination occurred in the warmest climate. In general, the warmer the climate the more germination occurred in autumn instead of spring. Papaver argemone, phylogenetically most distant from the others, was, in contrast to the other taxa, restricted to germinating only at lower temperatures. Conclusions: Seed dormancy and germination may be described by dormancy pattern, germination preferences and dormancy strength. The general dormancy pattern was a common feature for these taxa and therefore probably an evolutionary conservative character. Germination preferences varied between taxa, resulting in different temperature optima and intervals for germination, and dormancy strength was to some extent taxon-specific, but highly variable. The dormancy pattern explained how the taxa can perform as winter annuals in warmer climates, but mainly as summer annuals in colder climates. Hence, {{there is no need to}} interpret the within-taxon temporal differences in seedling emergence as local adaptations. In the field, an entire seed cohort will not germinate during a single season. Instead, emergence will be distributed over several seasons, regardless of local climate, weather and soil cultivation methods. The original article is: Laila M.

Twenty of these [mean age 47. 6  years, mean body mass index (BMI) 33. 1, 16  m, 4  f) were willing to follow up on an 8 -week, three times per week, 90 -min low intense physical exercise in their individual fat burning mode, which has been determined by an exercise testing with spiro-ergometry upfront. The subjects were evenly randomized into a hypoxia and sham hypoxia group.
