5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an <b>adjective</b> are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the <b>adjective,</b> e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an <b>adjective</b> {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E

50|$|There {{are a few}} minor word {{classes that}} are related to {{adjectival}} nouns, namely the taru <b>adjectives</b> and naru <b>adjectives.</b> Of these, naru <b>adjectives</b> are fossils of earlier forms of na <b>adjectives</b> (the nari <b>adjectives</b> of Old Japanese), and are typically classed separately, while taru <b>adjectives</b> are a parallel class (formerly tari <b>adjectives</b> in Late Old Japanese), but are typically classed with na <b>adjectives.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Adjectives</b> are French-origin (Cree has no <b>adjectives),</b> and as in French {{they are}} either pre- or postnominal. Prenominal <b>adjectives</b> agree in gender (like French), however, postnominal <b>adjectives</b> do not agree in gender (unlike French).|$|R
5|$|A lesbian is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or sexual attraction to other females. The term lesbian {{is also used}} to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation, or as an <b>adjective</b> to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same-sex attraction.|$|E
5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} word order {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has word order rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. The <b>adjective</b> can be placed before or after the noun that it modifies.|$|E

50|$|This {{paradigm}} {{is used for}} <b>adjectives</b> ending in -ov / -in, for example otcov ("father's"), matkin ("mother's"). All of them are possessive <b>adjectives</b> (<b>adjectives</b> in -ov for masculine persons, <b>adjectives</b> in -in for feminine persons).|$|R
50|$|<b>Adjectives</b> are invariant, and adverbs are not {{distinguished}} from <b>adjectives.</b> <b>Adjectives</b> follow nouns and adverbs follow verbs but precede <b>adjectives.</b> The comparative is formed with plu or min, the superlative with la plu or la min.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an account of a {{particular}} use of French <b>adjectives,</b> which we will call taxonomic use. In such use, <b>adjectives</b> denote subkinds of the noun they modify, and exhibit syntactic, morphological and semantic peculiarities distinguishing them from <b>adjectives</b> in qualifying use. Some <b>adjectives</b> exhibiting such properties have a denominal origin, and are known as relational <b>adjectives</b> (Bally 1944, Bosque & Picallo 1996, McNally & Boleda 2004). However, we show that morphologically simple <b>adjectives,</b> usually used as qualifying <b>adjectives,</b> may also exhibit the same behavior. We suggest that these <b>adjectives</b> constitute a particular class of subsective <b>adjectives.</b> More precisely, it is shown that, when occurring postnominally, they refer to what we call 'distinguishing properties', whereas they exhibit a 'partitioning value' (i. e. they refer directly to a subkind of the modified noun) when prenominal. Yet, in both cases, they restrict the semantic span of the noun to one of its subkinds. The syntactic account of taxonomic modification suggested in the paper is based on the idea that <b>adjectives</b> in taxonomic use attach lower in the DP structure than <b>adjectives</b> in qualifying use. More specifically, we claim that the AgrPs of taxonomically interpreted <b>adjectives</b> merge lower than NumP, while that of qualifying <b>adjectives</b> attach above NumP...|$|R
5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the <b>adjective</b> slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius (518–520) in his De situ terrae sanctae {{mentions}} that 'close to Jacob's Well are {{the remains of}} Joseph the Holy'. The Madaba Mosaic Map (6th century) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – 'Joseph's' (τὸ τοῦ Ὶωσήφ) – where the usual <b>adjective</b> 'holy' (hagios) accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines is lacking.|$|E
5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an <b>adjective</b> such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E

40|$|Asked 96 Ss to {{evaluate}} hypothetical persons described by pairs of favorable and unfavorable personality <b>adjectives</b> that were either consistent or inconsistent in meaning. Recency effects occurred under all conditions. When the 2 <b>adjectives</b> in each pair were simply listed, evaluations were not substantially affected by inconsistency. Connecting <b>adjectives</b> by "and" and {{placing them in}} a sentence increased recency effects when the <b>adjectives</b> were consistent but reduced these effects when <b>adjectives</b> were inconsistent. In contrast, connecting <b>adjectives</b> by "but" in a sentence reduced recency effects when <b>adjectives</b> were consistent and increased them when <b>adjectives</b> were inconsistent.

50|$|In Lithuanian {{language}} <b>adjectives</b> {{have three}} declensions {{determined by the}} singular and plural nominative case inflections. <b>Adjectives</b> are matched with nouns in terms of number, gender, and case. Unlike nouns, which have two genders - masculine and feminine - <b>adjectives</b> have three (except -is, -ė <b>adjectives),</b> but the neuter <b>adjectives</b> (the third example in the table) have only one uninflected form.|$|R
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with <b>adjective</b> or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E
5|$|The place-name 'Blyth' {{is first}} attested in 1130 as 'Blida', and takes {{its name from}} the river Blyth. The river-name comes from the Old English <b>adjective</b> 'blithe' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. Interestingly, the town of Blyth is {{referred}} to as 'Blithmuth' in 1236 and 'Blithemuth' in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as 'Blythmouth', on the analogy of Tynemouth to the south.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The <b>adjective</b> geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

40|$|<b>Adjectives</b> are {{comparatively}} {{less well}} studied than the lexical categories of nouns and verbs. The present volume brings together {{studies in the}} syntax and semantics of <b>adjectives.</b> Four of the contributions investigate the syntax of <b>adjectives</b> {{in a variety of}} languages (English, French, Mandarin Chinese, Modern Hebrew, Russian, Spanish, and Serbocroatian). The theoretical issues explored include: the syntax of attributive and predicative <b>adjectives,</b> the syntax of nominalized <b>adjectives</b> and the identification of <b>adjectives</b> as a distinct lexical category in Mandarin Chinese. A further four contributions examine different aspects in the semantics of <b>adjectives</b> in English, French, and Spanish, dealing with superlatives, comparatives, and aspect in <b>adjectives.</b> This volume will be of interest to researchers and students in syntax, formal semantics, and language typology...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been made on the {{internal}} structures of verbs and nouns, but less {{is known about the}} internal structure of <b>adjectives.</b> A close examination of <b>adjectives</b> suggests that some <b>adjectives</b> have complex internal structures like items in other lexical categories. In this paper, I propose the internal structures of <b>adjectives</b> in Japanese in the framework of Distributed Morphology proposed by Marantz (1997 and subsequent work). I demonstrate that Japanese <b>adjectives</b> come in four types in terms of their syntactic and semantic properties, and claim that each type of <b>adjectives</b> has a different internal structure. This claim reveals that there is a close relationship between the internal structures of <b>adjectives</b> and their interpretations; the internal structure of <b>adjectives</b> determines their semantic type. This paper also demonstrates that there is a correlation to some extent between the morphology and the semantics of <b>adjectives</b> in Japanese...|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the <b>adjective</b> quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{recognised}} in 1783 by the German, August Batsch, as Agaricus flammans, and later sanctioned by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum. The specific epithet flammans is a Latin <b>adjective</b> meaning flaming. In 1871, with {{the recognition of}} Pholiota as an independent genus with type species Pholiota squarrosa, another German, Paul Kummer renamed the fungus Pholiota flammans. Lucien Quélet, a French mycologist, proposed another synonym, Dryophila flammans in 1886. American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill called the species Hypodendrum flammans in his 1912 study of Pacific Coast mushrooms, {{although he did not}} explain his rationale for transferring the species to Hypodendrum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adjective</b> Angevin is {{especially}} used in English history {{to refer to}} the kings who were also counts of Anjoubeginning with Henry II descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other Counts and Dukes of Anjou; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of Jerusalem and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the Capetian House of Anjou and the Valois House of Anjou.|$|E
40|$|The {{exclusively}} prenominal <b>adjectives</b> in Portuguese, or even {{in other}} romance languages, are treated superficially in the literature about <b>adjectives.</b> We don’t know much about these <b>adjectives,</b> their properties and why they exist. This paper seeks {{to take a few}} steps forward in this discussion. The properties mentioned currently in literature are, actually, a confusion between properties of fixed position <b>adjectives</b> and prenominal <b>adjectives</b> in general. After discussing data, we show two salient properties: exclusively prenominal <b>adjectives</b> do not occur in NP in Portuguese, but just in DPs (and it evidences that they are generated in a higher position of the structure); the meaning of these <b>adjectives</b> are independent from the noun (which means that these <b>adjectives</b> are not selected by the noun, but they syntactically select the noun instead). These distinctions indirectly show arguments in favor of the adjunction of other <b>adjectives</b> on the right side...|$|R
