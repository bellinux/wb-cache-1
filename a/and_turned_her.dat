5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E
25|$|After Rome became {{stabilized}} {{following the}} sacking, {{she left the}} city and returned to Mantua. She made it a centre of culture, started a school for girls, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> ducal apartments into a museum containing the finest art treasures. This {{was not enough to}} satisfy Isabella, already in her mid-60s, so she returned to political life and ruled Solarolo, in Romagna until her death on 13 February 1539.|$|E
25|$|Crane {{continued}} to produce valuable scientific {{work with the}} department <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention {{to the study of}} copepods. In 1935, she was able to identify around 60 species of copepods, of which almost half had never before been recorded in Bermuda. New data was recorded on color during life, swimming methods, breeding habits, growth stages, relative numbers of different species and sexes, diurnal migrations, effects of storms and currents and general viability.|$|E

25|$|Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs as {{a spirit}} of {{fertility}} and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid, he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by an ass, whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses {{and a willingness to}} see them destroyed in his honour. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into a lotus plant.|$|E
25|$|The sorceress Circe is {{a figure}} from Greek mythology {{whose father was}} the sun (Helios) and whose mother was an ocean nymph. She appears in three {{separate}} stories. The best known is when Odysseus visits her island of Aeaea {{on the way back}} from the Trojan War and she changes most of his crew into swine. He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her for a year and has a child called Telegonus by her. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of Picus, an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her {{fall in love with the}} sea-god Glaucus, who prefers the nymph Scylla to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into a monster.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1809, Baker and Tartar chased a Danish {{privateer}} sloop near Felixberg on {{the coast}} of Courland. The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sand hills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her. The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a half an inch to burn. The privateer's magazine contained about a hundredweight of powder; had it exploded it would have killed the boarding party. The prize crew then brought the sloop off. The privateer was probably Felix.|$|E

25|$|It {{was late}} winter and snow still {{fell in the}} region. Without even enough {{blankets}} to keep their sick and wounded warm, the bedraggled Confederates who returned to Santa Fe must have made a pitiable sight. Louisa went to visit their wounded and was so moved by their suffering that she revealed hidden stores of blankets <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> home into a field hospital; she personally led a hastily organized company of nurses {{to care for the}} sick and dying men and made trips to outlying encampments to bring her patients into Santa Fe or, failing that, to treat in situ those soldiers who could not be brought into the city. It was not until April 1 or 2 that General Sibley, who had been at Albuquerque most of this time, arrived at Santa Fe and personally met with Louisa. It is not known what transpired between them, but it can be presumed that he thanked her for caring for his men and reminisced about their earlier encounters when he and her husband had been on the same side.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s in Paraguay were {{characterized}} by repressive violence, armed attacks by soldiers and reprisals by guerrillas, which led to hundreds of deaths and imprisonment of political dissidents. Alternating waves of violence and conciliation served to strengthen fear and consolidate presidential power. In fact, women's suffrage was not achieved in Paraguay until 1961, and was not granted by means of women's agitation, as all forms of dissent were punished and democratization was extinguished. Rather, enfranchisement was granted because President Stroessner wanted to bolster his support with women who might influence voters. As early as 1962, together with María Campos Cervera, María Elena de Pérez, Mary del Pino, and Beatriz Méndez de Prieto, Casco established another organization they called Amparo a la Mujer (Refuge for Women) to continue the work they had begun in 1953. In 1963, a women's journal, Cuñatai, was launched, facilitating participation {{of women in the}} political arena, with Casco serving as the director. The journal survived {{for a year and a}} half. During all this time, Casco had continued teaching in various schools in Asunción, but in 1965 she stopped teaching <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> focus to politics.|$|E
25|$|Rome was now {{the undisputed}} {{mistress}} of the Western Mediterranean, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> gaze from defeated Carthage to the Hellenistic world. Small Roman forces had already been engaged in the First Macedonian War, when, in 214 BC, a fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus had successfully thwarted Philip V from invading Illyria with his newly built fleet. The rest {{of the war was}} carried out mostly by Rome's allies, the Aetolian League and later the Kingdom of Pergamon, but a combined Roman-Pergamene fleet of ca. 60 ships patrolled the Aegean until the war's end in 205 BC. In this conflict, Rome, still embroiled in the Punic War, was not interested in expanding her possessions, but rather in thwarting the growth of Philip's power in Greece. The war ended in an effective stalemate, and was renewed in 201 BC, when Philip V invaded Asia Minor. A naval battle off Chios ended in a costly victory for the Pergamene-Rhodian alliance, but the Macedonian fleet lost many warships, including its flagship, a deceres. Soon after, Pergamon and Rhodes appealed to Rome for help, and the Republic was drawn into the Second Macedonian War. In view of the massive Roman naval superiority, the war was fought on land, with the Macedonian fleet, already weakened at Chios, not daring to venture out of its anchorage at Demetrias. After the crushing Roman victory at Cynoscephalae, the terms imposed on Macedon were harsh, and included the complete disbandment of her navy.|$|E

500|$|Imperator Aleksander III ( [...] , [...] "Emperor Alexander III") was {{launched}} on 2 April 1914, renamed Freedom (—Volia) in 1917 and then General Alekseyev (...) in 1920. The ship {{did not take}} part in operations during World War I due to long delays {{in the delivery of}} its machinery from Britain, but was able to go to sea by 1917 and conduct a series of trials. On 1 May 1918 she sailed from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk to avoid capture by advancing German troops. While at Novorossiysk she received an order to scuttle on 19 June 1918, but the majority of the crew refused to do so and decided to return to Sevastopol. Upon arrival she was disarmed and only guards were left on board, but the Germans took control on 1 October. She made a brief cruise with a German crew on 15 October, but her guns were still inoperable. After Germany's surrender she was turned over to the British, who moved her to İzmit in Turkey. In 1919 the British brought her back to the Black Sea <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> over to the White Russian forces, where she fought in the Russian Civil War against the Red Army, mainly carrying out shore bombardments. With the collapse of the White Russian armies in Southern Russia in 1920, the battleship assisted in their evacuation to French-owned Tunisia, where she was interned in Bizerte. She was eventually scrapped there to pay her docking fees.|$|E

She participated in the immigration of Jewish refugees to Palestine. On 24 January 1947 Haganah renamed her Chaim Arlosoroff after the assassinated leader of the Jewish Agency and she started a voyage that embarked 1,378 refugees in Sweden and Italy bound for Palestine. She was intercepted by the Royal Navy destroyer [...] and ran aground at Bat Galim, Haifa on 27 February 1947 injuring several passengers. The crew and passengers were arrested and interned in Cyprus.|$|E
2500|$|After 18 {{months at}} Oxford, she dropped out, finding {{work in a}} factory and a burger bar and hoping to write in her spare time.

But I very quickly {{discovered}} why people who work in factories don't usually have the energy to write when they get home." [...] She went into journalism, working on the diary at The Observer, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> eight months of experience in manual work (along with [...] "undercover" [...] stints as a nurse and an Army recruit) into the book A Working Life (1970).|$|E

2500|$|Dorothea Waddingham {{was born}} on a farm near Nottingham. She has been {{referred}} to as [...] "Nurse" [...] Waddingham, because the two murders she was accused and convicted of were committed in a nursing home she ran near Nottingham in England. However, she was not a qualified nurse and the only medical training she received was as a ward-maid at an infirmary near Burton-on-Trent. In 1925 she married Thomas Willoughby Leech. He was twice her age and dying of cancer. During their marriage she served two prison terms, for fraud and for theft. [...] Leech died in 1930, at which time Waddingham was seeing another man named Ronald Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan had fought in World War I and had been awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and also served in Ireland after the war. [...] They would marry and have four children. [...] While married to Sullivan she began to take in elderly and infirm patients, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> home at 32 Devon Drive, Nottingham into a nursing home.|$|E
2500|$|Fox Studio loaned Welch to Hammer Studios in Britain {{where she}} starred in One Million Years B.C. (1966), {{a remake of}} the Hal Roach film, One Million B.C. (1940). Her only costume was a two-piece deer skin bikini. She was {{described}} as [...] "wearing mankind's first bikini" [...] and the fur bikini {{was described as a}} [...] "definitive look of the 1960s". [...] The New York Times hailed her in its review of the film (which was released in the U.K. in 1966 and in the U.S. in 1967), [...] "A marvelous breathing monument to womankind." [...] One author said, [...] "although she had only three lines in the film, her luscious figure in a fur bikini made her a star and the dream girl of millions of young moviegoers". A publicity still of her in the bikini became a best-selling poster <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into an instant pin-up girl.
