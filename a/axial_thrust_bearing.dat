The research presented here investigates a high temperature permanent magnet biased magnetic bearing system which is jointly being researched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Electron Energy Corporation (EEC). The purpose of this research was to develop a permanent magnet biased magnetic bearing system using high temperature (HT) permanent magnets (PM) developed by EEC.

Of note are the low aspect ratio journal bearing and large journal bearing clearances, primarily limited by microfabrication, from which stable bearing operation must first be demonstrated as viable. Theoretical modeling of the gas-lubricated hydrostatic journal bearing presents design charts, a comparative study of existing predictions and investigation into rotational effects to consider the bearing stiffness during operation. Continued experimental refinements and exploration with our microfabricated rotor achieved rotational speeds up to 1. 4 million rpm and peripheral speeds in excess of 300 m/s. Extensive experimental data is presented with analysis, focusing on whirl motion and its harmonic resonances as candidates for instability. Causes of ultimate failure is suggested with recommendations for further improvements. Moreover, {{in an effort to}} accomplish self-sustained microbearings, the <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is redesigned for a self-acting spiral groove bearing. The chosen constraint is to incorporate the hydrodynamic thrust bearing with minimal changes to the current device, whilst providing the required load and stiffness. Stability analysis and rarefaction considerations on the optimized design suggests an operating range for the bearing, leading to a hybrid design for ample stiffness during initial operation. The design is then developed into a microfabrication process flow and implemented successfully into the MicroBearing test devices. Experiments on a hybrid bearing were performed to gage the spiral grooves characteristics. A purely hydrodynamic aft thrust bearing device is then tested for operation through low speeds, although the effects of the spiral grooves could not be accurately determined. Finally, transition to a hydrodynamic operating mode for a hybrid bearing is demonstrated. by Chee Wei Wong. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|LectureLecture 11 : The {{axial thrust}} is {{basically}} {{generated by a}} pressure imbalance across the impeller. The impeller is subjected to a great force trying to move it against the incoming flow. The cumulative thrust of all impellers on the shaft, especially when the impeller arrangement is in-line, has to be compensated by a balance piston. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the calculation procedure for the accurate evaluation of the thrust in centrifugal compressors for medium and high pressure applications. In this respect the paramount factors which influence the thrust are considered such as the operating conditions (surge or choke), the different combinations of operating modes inside the compressor (in the case of multi-section configuration), as well as variable labyrinth seal clearances and different roughness of rotor and stator. Different arrangements of the compressor like in-line and back-to-back configurations are analysed and compared with regard to their influence on thrust and thrust variation. An example with a medium pressure compressor is given. The paper also focuses on the main inaccuracies for the calculation of the thrust like the core rotation factor and the degree of reaction of the stages. To validate the calculations, extensive measurements of the thrust forces acting on the <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> were performed during the full-load, full-pressure factory testing of different high-pressure centrifugal compressors. The results of the tests demonstrate the accuracy of the prediction and the high sensitivity of the thrust to the boundary conditions. The evaluation of the thrust analyses is the base for the further determination of the stability behavior of the compressor which is compared to the damping measurement carried out during factory testing. These measurements emphasize the importance of performing such thrust measurements during a full-load, full-pressure or ASME PTC 10 Type 1 test. The requirements of some specifications are discussed and their consequences on the design of the compressor are evaluated with respect to their feasibility.

However, the opening or closing of valves, or the starting or tripping of pumps, in the system can generate high unsteady pressures that can damage piping and components in the system along with the pumping machinery itself. These unsteady pressures can result in large forces that are reacted at the pump nozzles. These loads can lead to casing failures or extrusion of the flange gasket.

The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with feed orifices located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications.

40|$|LecturePg. 27 - 32 <b>Thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> {{failures}} {{on older}} equipment, especially large steam turbines, {{can be costly}} problems to remedy. A unique solution to a steam turbine <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> problem that confronted Southern California Edison (SCE) is examined. The prohibitive cost of correcting the problem had forced SCE to consider mothballing the turbine. An evaluation of the situation by experts {{in the area of}} <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> design produced a cost effective solution-a hydrostatic assisted <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> design. The solution was implemented, and the results have proven satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Case StudyA {{centrifugal}} compressor in olefins plant charge gas service experienced excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperatures after startup following a field overhaul and rerate. While {{the machine was}} online, an analytical study was carried out to determine the possible causes for the excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperature. The study involved confirmation of the aero load through calculation, verifying the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing?s</b> capacity {{with the use of}} computer modeling, and correlation with operating field data to determine the likely cause of <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> distress. A mechanical test of an identical spare bearing was conducted on an existing <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig to confirm the results of the analytical study and field observations. A compressor outage was ultimately required to remedy the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> issue. A methodical approach to the shutdown work was employed to assure detection and correction of the cause for the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> distress while minimizing the duration of the plant outage. The approach included full scale oil flow rate testing in the field as well as a comprehensive bearing disassembly and inspection plan. The culprit for the excessive <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> temperature was discovered and corrected allowing for successful compressor operation after restart. This case study examines non-intrusive analysis and test methods to understand the issue without the chance of repeated outages...|$|R
