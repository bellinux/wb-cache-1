Dandelion wine is one of the drinks produced by use of different amounts of various ingredients and available equipment in the fermentation laboratory. The following characteristics are determined upon the main fermentation in the matured and clarified wine:- sensory indicators (color, appearance and clearness; aroma and bouquets, taste and texture, and aftertaste),- analytical indicators (<b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> <b>by</b> volume, determination of sugars, total acidity, volatile acidity).

40|$|An {{analytical}} challenge {{has been}} published in Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry Journal which provides a solution to Mendeleyev vodka challenge. The strength of alcohol can be changed easily, by mixing various volumes of water and ethanol.

Aerometers are {{the status quo in}} spirit analysis, which owes to the large difference between the density of pure water and alcohol.

2500|$|As {{with red}} wine-making, {{harvesting}} is manual or mechanized, and may include sorting. The grapes are then transferred into a press to be pressed. [...] Once {{the grape must}} is in the tank, the sludge is removed, normally after certain enzymes have been added. At this stage pre-fermentation cold stabulation (at temperatures between 10 and 12°C for several days) may be carried out {{in order to promote}} the extraction of aromas. [...] Normally, however, after 12 to 48 hours, the clear juice is drawn off and left to ferment. Alcoholic fermentation continues under supervision, particular attention being paid to the temperature, which must remain more or less stable (between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius). If necessary, chaptalization is also carried out in order to boost the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> <b>by</b> volume. Malolactic fermentation and maturing then take place in barrels or in vats. Once this process is completed, the wine is filtered in order to clarify it. The final stage of the whole operation is the bottling of the wine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ever since Gay-Lussac's time, the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> <b>by</b> volume (% vol) {{has been}} {{determined}} by using densimetric measurements. The typical reference procedure involves distillation followed by pycnometry, which is comparably labour-intensive and therefore expensive. At present, infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with multivariate regression is widely applied as a screening procedure, which allows one to determine <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> in less than 2 min without any sample preparation. The disadvantage is the relatively large investment for Fourier transform (FT) IR or near-IR instruments, {{and the need for}} matrix-dependent calibration. In this study, we apply a much simpler device consisting of a patented multiple-beam infrared sensor in combination with a flow-through cell for automated alcohol analysis, which is available in a portable version that allows for on-site measurements. Results During method validation, the precision of the infrared sensor was found to be equal to or better than densimetric or FTIR methods. For example, the average repeatability, as determined in 6 different wine samples, was 0. 05 % vol and the relative standard deviation was below 0. 2 %. Accuracy was ensured by analyzing 260 different alcoholic beverages in comparison to densimetric or FTIR results.

40|$|For {{a number}} of years, soft {{ionization}} mass spectrometry {{has been used for}} studying noncovalently bound complexes. An intriguing question in this context is whether MS experiments can be used to measure the interaction strength. A number of recent studies have addressed this question. The results of these studies, as well as the methods employed are reviewed here. We distinguish between liquid-phase methods such as mass spectrometrically detected melting curves, titration experiments, or competition experiments, and gas-phase methods such as cone voltage-driven dissociation, collision-induced dissociation, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation, or thermal dissociation of gas-phase complex ions. With a few exceptions, no agreement exists between solution-phase and gas-phase binding energies. The main reason is that electrostatic and dipolar noncovalent interactions are strengthened in the absence of solvent shielding, while other noncovalent interactions, in par-ticular hydrophobic interactions, become less important in the absence of solvent. The possibility to quantitatively measure solution-phase as well as gas-phase noncovalent interaction <b>strengths</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometry opens fascinating perspectives for very high sensitivity screening assays as well as for improved fundamental {{understanding of the nature of}} noncovalen...|$|R

The liquor (Tharra) contain many impurities and is often injurious to health. This study examines the impact of consumption of unsafe liquor on socio-economic and health context in Pakistan by using primary data obtained through filling of suitably designed questionnaires and finding out quality of homemade liquor samples collected from local Bathas. The data was collected by taking representative samples consisting of males from age groups 14 to onwards. The participants were enrolled using CAGE (screening tool. Our data revealed that majority of middle age group (57 %) was involved in liquor “Tharra” drinking (36 - 45 years and 26 – 35 years).
