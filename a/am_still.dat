5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and <b>am</b> <b>still</b> at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

500|$|In February 1912, Mackintosh married Gladys Campbell, {{and settled}} into an office job as {{assistant}} secretary to the Imperial Merchant Service Guild in Liverpool.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} was mixed. Some critics {{praised the}} [...] "rich language" [...] {{used in the}} novel. [...] However, others disapproved of the open sexuality of the novel, and its explicit use of the words [...] "penis", [...] "vagina", [...] "orgasm" [...] and [...] "condoms" [...] was considered [...] "too much"; other controversial terms include [...] "rape me", [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>still</b> a virgin", and [...] "masturbation". [...] Utami's own mother refused to read the novel aloud to her nearly blind husband, stating that it is [...] "not meant for those of their generation".

[...] But he later {{changed his mind and}} joined the majority in Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied it to state as well as federal criminal investigations. In his concurrence, he indicated that his support was based on the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of the right against self-incrimination, not on the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. He wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>still</b> not persuaded that the Fourth Amendment, standing alone, would be enough to bar the introduction into evidence ... seized ... in violation of its commands." ...|$|E
