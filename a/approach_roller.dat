As {{he looked}} back at the <b>approaching</b> <b>roller</b> he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed, for it appeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position, that it seemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft. There was, indeed, some danger of this. Glancing along its length, Jarwin saw that here and there the edge was lipping over, while in one place, not far off, the thunder of its fall had already begun. Another moment, and it appeared to hang over his head; the raft was violently lifted at the stern, caught up, and whirled onward at railway speed, like a cork {{in the midst of a}} boiling cauldron of foam. The roar was deafening. The tumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times. Jarwin held on firmly to the mast with his right arm, and grasped the terrier with his left hand, for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious motion. It all passed with bewildering speed. It seemed as if, in one instant, the raft was hurled through the narrows, and launched into the calm harbour within. An eddy, at the inner side of the opening, swept it round, and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was composed on the beach.|$|R

40|$|A fault {{diagnosis}} <b>approach</b> for <b>roller</b> bearing based on improved intrinsic timescale decomposition de-noising and kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate Yu Yang 1, 2, Haiyang Pan 1, 2, Li Ma 1, 2 and Junsheng Cheng 1, 2 The measured vibration signal of roller bearings has noise signals, which will largely influence {{the accuracy of}} roller bearing {{fault diagnosis}}. This paper puts forward a vibration signal de-noising method based upon improved intrinsic timescale decomposition (ITD); fuzzy entropy is then extracted as the fault feature of the roller bearing. Essentially the fault diagnosis of roller bearings {{is a process of}} pattern recognition. Targeting the limitation of existing pattern recog-nition methods, a new pattern recognition method – variable predictive model-based class discriminate (VPMCD) – is introduced into roller bearing fault identification. In the original VPMCD classifier, however, only the regression model could be used to predict, which will reduce the prediction’s accuracy when the relation between features is complicated. Aimed at this defect, a kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate (KVPMCD) pattern recognition method is presented in this paper. The kriging model is composed of a regression model and a correlation model, of which the correlation model is a local deviation that is created {{on the basis of a}} global model, to make up for the shortcomings of the simple regression model in the original VPMCD. Therefore, a fault diagnosis <b>approach</b> for <b>roller</b> bearing based on improved ITD de-nosing and KVPMCD is proposed in this paper. The analysis results from experimental signals with normal and defective roller bearings indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis approach can accurately and effectively distinguish the status of roller bearings with or without fault and fault patterns.

30|$|Technologies for bio-degumming of Erwinia carotovora (Liu and Peng 2004), Bacillus pumilus (Basu et al. 2009), Aspergillus niger (Zheng et al. 2010), and Bacillus subtilis (Guo et al. 2011) on ramie, kenaf, {{and other}} fiber crops have been {{reported}} in China and in foreign countries. However, few studies have investigated the bio-degumming of jute. A Micrococcus sp. strain that can accomplish jute degumming within 6  days was screened (Haque et al. 2003). The proposed degumming technology was combined with mechanical rolling preprocessing, which can accomplish bio-degumming of jute within 15  h. This approach includes two important aspects: (1) A highly efficient degumming strain Pectobacterium sp. DCE- 01 was reported, which secretes mannase, pectinase, and xylanase simultaneously. (2) This <b>approach</b> adopted <b>roller</b> compaction engine prior to biological fermentation. The mechanical rolling (preprocessing) disrupted the adhesion between non-cellulosic materials and cellulose, resulting in direct fall-off of abundant non-cellulosic materials, intensifying the infiltration capacity of microorganism and its enzymes. As a result, the degumming effect of jute improved significantly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations. The presented approach models the chain links as spatial decoupled dynamic bodies. The chain links are modeled using two different dynamic representations for the pin-link and the bushing-link. The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the rollers. The adjacent pin and bushing links are connected by compliant bushing force elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the sprocket teeth while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive <b>approach.</b> Complex <b>roller</b> chains drives, bicycle chain and conveyance systems can be easily modeled and analyzed using the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the complex}} motion control in {{flexible}} roll forming when processing the sheet metal with variable cross-section, it is required for high real-time and high precision control during the processing. Controlling servo motor by adopting the configuration programming is a common <b>approach</b> to achieve <b>roller</b> motion, {{but it will not}} be able or difficult to realize by the configuration programming for complex contour sheet metal without the rules such as hyperbolic, or the molding product in non-symmetric cross-section shape, etc. Based on the process characteristic of flexible roll forming and its motion control technology, this paper adopts the variable time-domain discrete interpolation control method to process the variable cross-section sheet metal. Experiments indicate that this control method provides a good operating method for the sheet metal forming with complex variable cross-section shape in flexible roll forming...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} forming {{temperature}} and feed rate on the flaring of AZ 31 magnesium cups {{was investigated in}} the warm flow-forming process. Flaring is a common phenomenon in flow-forming process whereby {{the diameter of the}} work-piece is observed to increase gradually along the flow-formed path. In this study, forward flow-forming process was performed on a cup-shaped work-piece by using two diametrically opposite <b>rollers</b> (<b>approach</b> angle of 20 °) at a constant thickness reduction. To study the effects on flaring, experiments were performed at feed rates of 0. 2 mm/rev, 0. 4 mm/rev, and 0. 8 mm/rev and at forming temperatures between 50 ~ 300 °C. Experimental results indicated that feed rate was the most significant parameter influencing flaring while temperature mainly improve the formability of the material. It is believed that a higher feed rate resulted in an increase in metal flow in the circumferential direction because of higher mean circumferential strain and hence increases flaring. Flaring was also observed to be most severe at forming temperature of 300 °C and feed rate of 0. 8 mm/rev due to the excessive metal flow in the cirucmferential direction of the test-piece. This study clarifies the relationship between feed rate and the extend of flaring and that forming temperature has little influence on flaring from temperature range of 50 °C to 250 °C...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{developed}} refractories {{with reduced}} carbon content for application in steel industry were investigated regarding to their thermo-mechanical behaviour. Another {{major part of}} this work {{was focused on the}} development and trial of new/optimization of established test methods (thermal shock by heating via electron beam and wedge splitting test). Al 2 O 3 with the addition of 2. 5 wt. % ZrO 2 and TiO 2 respectively (AZT) leads to an improved thermal shock behaviour compared to pure Al 2 O 3 materials. Temperature dependent investigations revealed a thermal hysteresis of elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion, accompanied by a phase transformation of ZrO 2 (monoclinic -> tetragonal). High temperature (800 - 1000 °C) wedge splitting tests were performed with optical notch opening determination for Al 2 O 3 and AZT. The phase transformation of ZrO 2 leads to a more brittle behaviour of AZT at 800 °C compared to room temperature. Different loading configurations for the wedge splitting test were tested using Alumina and Al 2 O 3 -C materials in order to apply the test method on small specimen geometries (40 x 40 x 20 mm 3). Promising results were obtained from a simple <b>approach</b> using two <b>rollers</b> into a grooved sample. With this method, it was possible to determine a constant (sample material independent) friction coefficent (µ = 0, 13). The results showed a good agreement with experimental data obtained from compact tension tests. Thermal shock tests by heating using the electron beam facility JUDITH 1 allowed the application of a well distributed loading pattern on MgO-C Materials. Temperatures up to 1400 °C at the surface were achieved. The main damage was observed within the MgO grains...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the numerical and physical behaviour of a hybrid finite-volume finite-difference Boussinesq-type model, using a rotational surface <b>roller</b> <b>approach</b> in the surf-zone is presented. The relevant theory for the required development of a numerical model implementing this technique is outlined. The proposed method looks to achieve a more physically realistic description of the hydrodynamics by considering the rotational nature of the highly turbulent flow found during wave breaking. This involves a semi-analytical solution to the vorticity transport equation and provides a mechanism by which energy is dissipated. Resolving vorticity within the flow also allows vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity to be constructed, offering valuable detail that is otherwise unavailable when using equivalent irrotational Boussinesq-type models. By obtaining additional information about {{the structure of the}} flow, other quantities can be determined, such as the undertow, which has a key role in morphodynamic processes occurring in this region. These benefits are combined with a finite-volume finite-difference scheme, which yields improvements in stability and possesses inherent shock-capturing capabilities. The ability of the model to replicate laboratory observations is verified, and identified shortcomings are explained {{in the context of the}} numerical procedure and the assumptions made during the derivation of the governing equations. Although the weak nonlinearity of the Boussinesq-type equations means the shoaling characteristics of the model do not accurately reflect those found experimentally, the adopted formulation of the finite-volume scheme is shown to prevent the inclusion of the necessary higher-order derivatives which exist in a fully-nonlinear formulation. In order to establish a realistic dissipation mechanism, it is vital that the extent of any misleading numerical artefacts are recognised and their effects alleviated. This study explores a range of physical attributes predicted by the present model and discusses the numerical features of the scheme, evaluating how these influence the results...|$|R
40|$|The {{vortical}} {{structure of}} a plane impinging jet is considered. The jet was locked both in phase and laterally in space, and time series digital particle image velocimetry measurements were made both of the jet exiting the nozzle and as it impinged on a perpendicular wall. Iso-vorticity and iso-lambda (2) surfaces coupled with critical point theory were used to identify and clarify structure. The flow near the nozzle was much as observed in mixing layers, where the shear layer evolves into spanwise rollers, only here the rollers occurred symmetrically about the jet midplane. Accordingly the rollers were seen to depict spanwise perturbations with the wavelength of flutes at the nozzle edge and were connected, {{on the same side}} of the jet, with streamwise 2 ̆ 7 successive ribs 2 ̆ 7 of the same wavelength. This wavelength was 0. 71 of the distance between rollers and, contrary to some experiments in mixing layers, did not double when the rollers paired. Structures not reported previously but evident here with iso-vorticity, lambda (2) and critical point theory are 2 ̆ 7 cross ribs 2 ̆ 7, which extend from the downstream side of each roller to its counterpart across the symmetry plane; their spanwise periodic spacing exceeds that of successive ribs by a factor of three. Cross ribs stretch because of the diverging flow as the <b>rollers</b> <b>approach</b> the wall and move apart, causing the vorticity within them to intensify. This process continues until the cross ribs reach the wall and merge with 2 ̆ 7 wall ribs 2 ̆ 7. Wall ribs remain near the wall throughout the cycle and are composed of vorticity of the same sign as the cross ribs, but the intensity level of the vorticity within them is cyclic. Details of the expansion of fluid elements, evaluated from the rate of strain tenser, revealed that both cross and successive ribs align with the principal axis and that the vorticity comprising them is continuously amplified by stretching. It is further shown, by appeal to the production terms of the phase-averaged vorticity equation, that wall ribs are sustained by merging and stretching rather than reorientation of vorticity. Moreover production of vorticity is a maximum when cross and wall ribs merge and is greatest near the symmetry plane of the jet. The demise of successive ribs on the other hand occurs away from the symmetry plane and would appear to be less important dynamically than cross ribs merging with wall ribs...|$|R
