50|$|On March 24, 1988, Telemundo {{announced}} that it would end its agreement with Hispanic-American Broadcasting and enter into a news sharing partnership with CNN to produce early and late evening national newscasts, an hour-long weekend news review program, Resumen Semanal Telemundo-CNN, and news briefs that aired five times per day for Telemundo. CNN assumed production responsibilities for the network's newscasts, now titled Noticiero Telemundo CNN ("Telemundo CNN News"), on May 31 of that year, with production of the newscasts becoming based at the cable news channel's headquarters <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> in Atlanta.|$|E

50|$|On March 14, 2008, a EF-2 tornado {{passed through}} {{downtown}} Atlanta, damaging <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> and leaving water and {{dust in the}} upper floors. The ceiling of the atrium was also damaged, causing water to pour in and partially flood <b>the</b> food court. <b>CNN's</b> library was damaged, although it is unknown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment how much of its archives were damaged. Numerous injuries and widespread damage were reported overall. The Omni Hotel, attached to <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center,</b> was evacuated as a precaution, and more than 400 rooms had to be emptied of occupancy for two weeks.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} widely speculated that in 1993 media mogul Ted Turner, founder of the 24-hour news network CNN, was {{inspired}} to create a talk show after walking through the atrium of the company's headquarters in Atlanta, <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> As <b>the</b> story goes, Turner walked through {{the ground floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> and saw <b>the</b> sunlight shining down into the atrium. He had a revelation that the side of atrium in front of The Turner Store would be a great place for a talk show. So one year later and after millions of dollars in renovations, a portion of <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> food court was transformed into a state of the art broadcast studio that seated over two hundred people and Talkback Live was created. One of CNN's top producers was tapped to head up this new concept, Teya Ryan, an award winning producer in charge of CNN's environmental features.|$|R

The freestanding escalator <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> is longer at 205 feet. The Ellis Street entrance was closed {{for more than two}} years for renovation. It re-opened on August 24, 2012. The Harris Street (northwest) entrance has a map of the MARTA system with proposed lines on it. The station was featured in the 1985 movie The Heavenly Kid.|$|E
50|$|Clash of the Champions XIV {{took place}} on January 30, 1991 at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville, Georgia. There were 2200 fans in {{attendance}} and the show drew a 3.9 rating on TBS. Dusty Rhodes returned to WCW following a brief stint in the WWF(E) as the new booker and as Color Commentator. It was originally set to be held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> in Atlanta, Georgia, but due to security reasons arising from the escalation of the Persian Gulf War, it {{was moved to the}} Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville. Doom was disqualified due to Sting being tossed over the top rope by Butch Reed. Tom Zenk lost the WCW World Television Championship on January 7, but the match had not yet aired, so Zenk was recognized as champion.|$|E
50|$|The WWF {{version of}} the show {{received}} much lower Nielsen ratings than its NWA-associated forerunner. As a result, on March 30, 1985, McMahon sold the Saturday night time slot (but not the Georgia Championship Wrestling promotion) to Jim Crockett, Jr., a Charlotte, North Carolina-based promoter who ran NWA-branded shows in the Mid-Atlantic states. Jim Crockett Promotions took over production of the TV show using the same set.. In time, the show was renamed WCW Saturday Night, reflecting an overhauled look and a new home studio-arena <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> In 2001, the WWF gained the rights to Crockett's library of GCW/WCW/NWA matches and shows, augmenting the WWE Tape Library through its purchase of assets and trademarks belonging to the now-defunct WCW (now a legal entity called WCW, Inc.).|$|E

Also, 9News will be trained by CNN staff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> in Atlanta, Georgia to enhance their reporting that will also help them to contribute reports for CNN International along with its news bureaus scattered worldwide; as consultants from the latter will help Nine Media/RPN for further development and expansion of CNN Philippines. The official news website, 9news.ph will be redesigned and changed into CNNPhilippines.com.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{also carried}} a week-daily news block, In Session (the {{successor}} to Court TV News), which provided {{live coverage of}} trials, legal news and details of highly publicized crimes Monday through Fridays from 9 to 11 a.m. ET (except during national holidays, with reruns of the channel's reality programming airing {{in place of the}} block on such days). Its coverage included analysis from anchors and guests to help viewers understand legal proceedings. In Session also ran a blog, Sidebar, where the In Session team posted updated legal news and analysis. In Session moved to a new studio in Atlanta <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> on November 16, 2009. Production of the block was eventually taken over by TruTV's sister network, HLN. In Session anchors also appeared on CNN to provide legal analysis about current crime stories and trials. In Session concluded its run on September 26, 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, on March 24, 1988, Telemundo {{entered into}} a partnership with cable news channel CNN to produce two daily newscasts, titled Noticiero Telemundo CNN ("Telemundo CNN News"); CNN took over production of the network's newscasts on May 31 of that year.
