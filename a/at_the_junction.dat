40|$|Abstract- In Urban area {{congestion}} mostly occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b> <b>Junctions</b> are <b>the</b> {{intersection of}} roads, where {{the flow of}} the vehicles is controlled by traffic police or traffic lights. When the flow of vehicles increases <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions,</b> it causes traffic jams and stream of vehicles incur longer waiting time. When there is a crossing at a junction, a stream of vehicle has to wait for others. Sometimes, the longer stream of waiting vehicles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> causes stalemate situation. Design of an uninterrupted traffic flow system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traffic <b>junctions</b> without have to wait for others will lead to minimize severe traffic congestion. We have proposed a traffic flow system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> to make <b>the</b> flow of traffic streams an uninterrupted flow system. This will also lead to design of a traffic light and traffic police free system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> of urban traffic roads...|$|R

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> of Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> of Church and Main Streets.

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity.
