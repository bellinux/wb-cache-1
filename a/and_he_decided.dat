5|$|As the Ju 87s {{began their}} attack, Spitfires from No. 234 Squadron engaged the 25-strong Bf 109 escort {{commanded}} by Hauptmann Karl-Wolfgang Redlich. I./JG 27s commander, Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Eduard Neumann heard the battle developing, but communications were poor <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to let Redlich, {{one of his}} most experienced Staffelkapitän (Squadron Leaders) fight alone. In the resulting combat, three Bf 109s were shot down.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to lift it and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|General William Howe {{had taken}} his army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north {{so that he would}} not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E

5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{arrived in}} Paris on 20 March and governed {{for a period}} now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June the armed forces {{available}} to him had reached 200,000, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> {{to go on the}} offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.|$|E

5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> {{not to run}} {{for reelection}} in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, and in that year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total}} of 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.|$|E
5|$|By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured {{most of the}} castles in Scotland {{once held}} by Edward, pushing raiding parties into {{northern}} England as far as Carlisle. In response, Edward planned a major military campaign {{with the support of}} Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong. Meanwhile, Robert had besieged Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender. News of this reached the King in late May, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to speed up his march north from Berwick to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly spearmen, prepared to prevent Edward's forces from reaching Stirling.|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to seek another line of work.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Katzenberg had {{frequently}} {{suggested an}} animated {{adaptation of the}} 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to put the idea into production after founding DreamWorks in 1995. To make this inaugural project, DreamWorks employed artists {{who had worked for}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and the recently disbanded Amblimation, totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different nations. The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery, created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics.|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|Loose Fur is an American {{rock band}} {{comprising}} Wilco members Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Kotche, and Wilco collaborator Jim O'Rourke. The trio first convened in May 2000 {{in preparation for}} a Tweedy performance at a festival in Chicago. Tweedy was offered the opportunity to collaborate with an artist of his choosing, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to work with O'Rourke. O'Rourke brought Kotche to a rehearsal session, and the trio recorded an album's worth of songs. The trio have since released two albums, 2003's Loose Fur and 2006's Born Again in the USA, for Drag City. The band has only toured once.|$|E

5|$|Oryol {{took the}} lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships to {{disengage}} in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of {{the remains of the}} fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to surrender his ships at 10:30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E

5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very {{different}} to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E

5|$|While Philip was {{involved}} in this campaign, his allies the Acarnanians became involved in a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes. The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to send a force under the command of Nicanor the Elephant to assist them in their attack on Attica. The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by {{the former prime minister}} Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland {{advanced}} to the NFL championship {{for the third time}} in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.|$|E
