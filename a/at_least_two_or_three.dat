5|$|The Baroque {{style in}} Sicily was largely {{confined}} to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest {{examples of this}} style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By {{the middle of the}} 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably {{different from that of the}} mainland, it typically included <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words.|$|E
5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three.</b> Jerome's references to a Gospel of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to the Gospel of Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the Gospel of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the Gospel of the Hebrews. The relationship between the Gospel of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{registers}} are clocked in a stop/go fashion using {{a majority}} rule. Each register has an associated clocking bit. At each cycle, the clocking bit {{of all three}} registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is clocked if the clocking bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each step <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> registers are clocked, and each register steps with probability 3/4.|$|E

That ground will also host one game in the 2005–06 Carib Beer Cup, along with Kensington Park in Kingston and Chedwin Park in Spanish Town.|$|E
25|$|The β-sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is {{a common}} motif of regular {{secondary}} structure in proteins. Beta sheets consist of beta strands (also β-strand) connected laterally by <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of β-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the amyloidoses such as Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

25|$|Like town planning, housing also {{followed}} the common pattern of other Harappan cities. Due to grid-pattern of town planning like a chess board, all houses opened out to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> roads or lanes. Each house had a courtyard and 6-7 rooms on three sides, with a well in some houses. One house had stairs {{for going to}} the roof. Houses were built of 30 × 15 × 7.5cm mud bricks (same as those used in second structural phase of fort wall). Burnt bricks were used in drains, wells, bathing platforms and door-sills, besides fire-altar. Floors of rooms were built of thrashed fine mud, sometimes laid with mud bricks or terracotta cakes. One house had floors built of burnt tiles decorated with geometrical designs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} two years the Class Teacher takes the major {{responsibility}} for subject teaching and then, as the boys move up the School, greater specialisation is introduced. In Year 3 and 4, it is normal for the Class Teacher to teach the three core subjects to their class along with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> other subjects. The majority of the teaching takes place in the Nash's building and in Tisdall's. Boys will use the specialist facilities for French, Art, ICT, Music and Design Technology. These subjects are normally delivered by subject specialists. In addition, all boys will have Physical Education and Swimming lessons alongside two double Games lessons. Boys are also encouraged to take a full part in the wide-ranging extracurricular programme.|$|E

Carabott stated that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> episodes would have been needed to properly tell the narrative of their introduction. Instead, he felt like the character introductions were rushed, even though they had all appeared on the series prior to season six.

500|$|Following the {{construction}} of the new camp site west of Lang Vei, Willoughby and his CIDG soldiers concentrated their efforts on strengthening the camp’s defenses, and they made relatively few contacts with the North Vietnamese. However, unbeknown to Willoughby, the North Vietnamese 304th Division had assembled on the battlefield, reinforced by the 198th Tank Battalion, with the following orders: the 66th Regiment was given the task of capturing Khe Sanh village, part of Huong Hoa District, to begin their Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign; the 24th Regiment was ordered to destroy the enemy strongholds of Ban Houei Sane and Lang Vei; while the 9th Regiment was ordered to destroy any reinforcements that may try to relieve those bases areas. From December 1967, CIDG soldiers operating from Lang Vei began to report more frequent contacts with the North Vietnamese. By mid-January, U.S. military intelligence also reported movements of North Vietnamese formations across the Xe Pone River from Laos into South Vietnam. At the same time, the North Vietnamese began to harass the Lang Vei Special Forces Camp with mortar and artillery fire <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times a week, and North Vietnamese patrols even probed the camp’s perimeters. [...] 3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated the combat strength of NVA and VC forces in the DMZ area during this period was 40,943 troops.|$|E
