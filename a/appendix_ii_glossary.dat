40|$|Background: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (NHANES) biospecimen {{program was}} formed to manage the {{collection}} of biospecimens (including serum, plasma, urine, and DNA) from NHANES cycles, the storage of biospecimens in NHANES biorepositories, accessing of biospecimens by researchers, and the providing of resulting data to future researchers. Data from biospecimen research can be combined with existing NHANES data. Objective: This report provides background {{on the development of}} NHANES biorepositories and describes the collection, processing, and storing of biospecimens; ethical considerations and informed consent; and the proposal process for accessing biospecimens and resulting data. The number and types of biospecimens collected in each survey cycle from NHANES III (198822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1994) through NHANES 199922 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2014 are discussed so that researchers can understand what biospecimens are available if they are considering using NHANES biospecimens in their research.

40|$|Background: As {{the nation}} 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s {{principal}} health statistics agency, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides statistical {{information that can}} be used to guide actions and policy to improve the health of the American people. As part of its ongoing efforts to fulfill this mission, NCHS conducts several population-based and establishment surveys that provide rich cross-sectional information on risk factors such as smoking, height and weight, health status, and socioeconomic circumstances. Although the survey data collected provide information on a wide range of health-related topics, they often lack information on longitudinal outcomes. Methods: This report describes the second linkage conducted between several NCHS surveys and administrative records from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, and the United States Renal Data Systems. A brief overview of the data sources, the methods used for linkage, descriptions of the resulting linked data files, and analytic guidance is provided. Conclusions: Through its record linkage program, NCHS has been able to enhance the survey data it collects by augmenting survey information with information from administrative data sources. These linkages of survey information with administrative data provide the unique opportunity to study changes in health status, health care utilization, and expenditures in specialized populations, such as low-income families with children, the elderly, and the disabled.
