Upon his return to London in 1752, Foote's new comedy, Taste, was produced at Drury Lane. Foote took aim at the burgeoning art and antiquities market and particularly aristocratic collectors. In his preface to the play, Foote specifies his targets as the [...] "barbarians who have prostituted the study of antiquity to trifling superficiality, who have blasted the progress of the elegant arts by unpardonable frauds and <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudices,</b> and who have vitiated the minds and morals of youth by persuading them that what serves only to illustrate literature is true knowledge and that active idelness is real business." ...|$|E
60|$|The English form a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} population of our French watering-place, and are deservedly addressed and respected in many ways. Some of the surface-addresses to them are odd enough, as when a laundress puts a placard outside her house announcing her possession of that curious British instrument, a 'Mingle;' or when a tavern-keeper provides accommodation for the celebrated English game of 'Nokemdon.' But, to us, it is not the least pleasant feature of our French watering-place that a long and constant fusion of the two great nations there, has taught each to like the other, and to learn from the other, and to rise superior to the <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudices</b> that have lingered among the weak and ignorant in both countries equally.|$|E
60|$|He {{had come}} into Cambridge with the {{intention}} of calling at Puritan Grange after he had left the attorney, and when he found himself in the street he walked on in the direction of Chesterton. He had wished to thank his wife's mother for her concession and had been told by Hester that if he would call, Mrs. Bolton would certainly see him now. Had there been no letter from the woman in Australia, he would probably not have obeyed his wife's behest in this matter. His heart and spirit would then have been without a flaw, and, proud in his own strength and his own rectitude, he would have declared to himself that the <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudices</b> of a fanatic woman were beneath his notice. But that letter had been a blow, and the blow, though it had not quelled him, had weakened his forces. He could conceal the injury done him even from his wife, but there was an injury. He was not quite the man that he had been before. From day to day, and from hour to hour, he was always remonstrating with himself because it was so. He was conscious that in some degree he had been cowed, and was ever fighting against the feeling. His tenderness to his wife was perhaps increased, because he knew that she still suffered from the letter; but he was almost ashamed of his own tenderness, as being a sign of weakness. He made himself very busy in these days,--busy among his brother magistrates, busy among his farming operations, busy with his tenants, busy among his books, so as to show to those around him that he was one who could perform all the duties of life, and enjoy all the pleasures, with an open brow and a clear conscience. He had been ever bold and self-asserting; but now he was perhaps a little over-bold. But through it all the Australian letter and the Australian woman were present to him day and night.|$|E
60|$|Proud and wilful as she seemed, Elsie {{had always}} prided herself on being just, {{and to be}} placed in the {{position}} of doing an honorable man a wrong was intolerable. The longer she dwelt upon her action the more uneasy she became. Her vision clarified. All that had been hidden by her <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> and reasonless dislike--the soldier's frank and manly firmness, Lawson's reproaches, her aunt's open reproof--all these grew in power and significance as she mused.|$|R

'To {{tell you}} the truth,' said he, 'I should be only too happy, {{on behalf of the}} owners, to let anyone have the house rent free for a term of years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited. It has been so long empty that some kind of <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> has grown up about it, and this can be best put down by its occupation--if only,' he added with a sly glance at Malcolmson, 'by a scholar like yourself, who wants its quiet for a time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I cannot {{execute a}} High Priest, {{because there is}} an <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> against it, and I cannot imprison him because all his {{subordinates}} would raise a crying that would bring the stars down on Zu-Vendis and crush it; but I can leave him to contemplate the altar of the Sun without anything to eat, because that is his natural vocation, and if thou wilt not marry me, O Agon! thou shalt be placed before the altar yonder with nought but a little water till such time as thou hast reconsidered the matter.' ...|$|R

6000|$|At the halting-place a [...] "cerastes" [...] (Echis carinata, Merr.), {{so called}} from the warty hollows over the eyes (?), was brought {{to me in a}} water-bag; the bearer {{transferred}} it to the spirit-bottle by neatly thrusting a packing-needle through the head. The pretty specimen of an amiable, and much oppressed, race did not show an atom of vice. I cannot conceive what has caused the <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> against snakes, even the most harmless. Perhaps we must trace it to the curious resemblance of the profile, with the flattened forehead, the steely bright eye, the formidable biting apparatus, and the vanishing chin, to the genus woman, species Lorette. It is hard to imagine that this little beast, which some one called a [...] "Cleopatra's hasp," [...] could be fatal: its small bag can hardly contain a couple of drops. Yet the vox populi is distinctly against me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} will, or I won't {{tell you}} one single thing. You must understand this: I'm {{not asking you to}} change yourself. Just want you to know what they think. You must do that, no matter how <b>absurd</b> their <b>prejudices</b> are, if you're going to handle them. Is it your ambition to make this a better town, or isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Germans have {{introduced}} stoves at Venice, {{but they are}} not in much favor with the Italians, who think their heat unwholesome, and endure a degree of cold, in their wish to dispense with fire, which we of the winter-lands know nothing of in our houses. They pay for their <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> with terrible chilblains; and their hands, which suffer equally with their feet, are, in the case of those most exposed to the cold, objects pitiable and revolting to behold when the itching and the effort to allay it has turned them into bloated masses of sores. It is not a pleasant thing to speak of; and the constant sight of the affliction among people who bring you bread, cut you cheese, and weigh you out sugar, by no means reconciles the Northern stomach to its prevalence. I have observed that priests, and those who have much to do in the frigid churches, are the worst sufferers in this way; and I think no one can help noting in the harsh, raw winter-complexion (for in summer the tone is quite different) of the women of all classes, the protest of systems cruelly starved of the warmth which health demands.|$|R
5000|$|Blom was forthright in his opinions. He {{could be}} almost gushing about his favourites, {{particularly}} Mozart, and most especially his operas. He wrote that Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes was [...] "so impressive and original {{that only the}} most <b>absurd</b> <b>prejudice</b> will {{keep it out of}} the great foreign opera houses". Equally, he did not shrink from criticising composers he thought less of, and introduced some of his own prejudices. He was capable of uniquely insightful comments on well-known works in which he held a minority opinion; e.g., that the solo part of the Sibelius Violin Concerto [...] "is closely interwoven with the symphonic tissue, and is therefore neglected by the average virtuoso" [...] (even though it is in fact {{one of the most popular}} and frequently played and recorded of all violin concertos). Even more notoriously and with far less insight, he wrote that Rachmaninoff [...] "did not have the individuality of Taneyev or Medtner. Technically he was highly gifted, but also severely limited. His music is ... monotonous in texture ... The enormous popular success some few of Rakhmaninov's works had in his lifetime is not likely to last, and musicians never regarded it with much favour". To this, Harold C. Schonberg, New York critic not immune to snobbery of his own, in his Lives of the Great Composers, responded with equally outspoken unfairness, [...] "It is one of the most outrageously snobbish and even stupid statements ever to be found in a work that is supposed to be an objective reference".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, the {{execution}} was not difficult; {{it was the}} planning of it all, the daring that was so fine. Schwarz, of course, was a foreigner; he had only been in England {{a little over a}} fortnight. Vassall's broken English misled him; probably he did not know the junior partner very intimately. I have no doubt that but for his uncle's <b>absurd</b> British <b>prejudice</b> and suspicions against the Russian Prince, Schwarz would not have been so ready to believe in the latter's roguery. As I said, {{it would be a great}} boon if English tradesmen studied Gotha more; but it was clever, wasn't it? I couldn't have done it much better myself." ...|$|R

Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either was concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.' ...|$|R
