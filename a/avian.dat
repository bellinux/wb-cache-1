5|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>avian</b> ecology field methods, {{including}} counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching <b>avian</b> ecology.|$|E
5|$|It is {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} parasites including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, tapeworms, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other <b>avian</b> diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from <b>avian</b> botulism and <b>avian</b> cholera, and can also contract <b>avian</b> influenza, the H5N1 strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{can act as}} vectors for {{spreading}} {{diseases such}} as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (<b>avian</b> tuberculosis), <b>avian</b> influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avians</b> are {{a race of}} bird-creatures, {{shown to}} be {{intelligent}}, fast and agile. <b>Avians</b> alone amongst the Savage Races have the ear of Big Boss Harky, due to their intelligent leader.|$|R
50|$|<b>Avians</b> {{include the}} American kestrel, Reddish egret and spoonbills.|$|R
50|$|Aczanny - small <b>avians.</b> Capable of {{atmospheric}} flight. The Aczanny pyramids are ruled by one called Soaring-over-Pyramids.|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} may contract <b>avian</b> tuberculosis, <b>avian</b> malaria and retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Captive starlings often accumulate excess iron in the liver, {{a condition}} that can be prevented by adding black tea-leaves to the food.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the expiry of the lease on the land, Penshurst Airfield closed on 28 July 1936. Air Travel Ltd moved to Gatwick. In 1938, the land was {{converted}} for use as a Polo ground by the Eridge Polo Club. Civil aircraft that were based at Penshurst include the Avro <b>Avian</b> III, Avro <b>Avian</b> IVM, Avro 504K and Avro 504N, de Havilland DH.60 Moth (various models), and Spartan Three-Seater.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many <b>avian</b> lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all <b>avian</b> lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E

5|$|No {{specific}} parasites of Fiji parrotfinch {{have been}} recorded, but microsporidiosis and <b>avian</b> malaria, both spread by parasites, {{have been found}} in captive populations of other parrotfinch species.|$|E
5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by <b>avian</b> diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from <b>avian</b> botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species. Several <b>avian</b> characteristics are compared {{in the table}} below.|$|E
50|$|Traveling {{between the}} two lands, the couple must learn to adapt to {{different}} ways of thinking and acting. The <b>avians</b> view the casual touching of the serpiente as scandalous, while the serpents view the emotionless reserve of the <b>avians</b> as cold and soulless. After pushing through the troubles of bringing the two groups together and surviving assassination attempts by their own trusted guards, Danica and Zane grow closer, until the one who they each used to despise was now the one they could never live without.|$|R

5000|$|Dakila, as {{protector}} of the skies, establishes a kingdom of <b>Avians</b> in Avila, the highest point in Mt. Apo. They have called themselves Mulawin. Though humans have caused {{the destruction of the}} forests, forcing <b>Avians</b> out of their own habitat, Dakila and most of the Mulawins have maintained their benevolence towards humans. This does not sit well with a faction of Mulawin headed by Ravenum. They decide to breakaway and form their own tribe called Ravena and establish a kingdom called Halconia in the fiery volcanic mines of Mt. Apo.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of asexually-reproducing <b>avian</b> malaria parasites in {{cells of the}} internal organs was first demonstrated by Henrique de Beaurepaire Aragão in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The <b>avian</b> heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the <b>avian</b> heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. <b>Avian</b> hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and <b>avian</b> cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, <b>avian</b> cholera and <b>avian</b> botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{standard}} extraembryonic membranes in birds, reptiles, and mammals: the yolk sac which surrounds the yolk, the amnion which surrounds and cushions the embryo, the allantois which among <b>avians</b> stores embryonic waste and assists with {{the exchange of}} carbon dioxide with oxygen {{as well as the}} resorption of calcium from the shell, and the chorion which surrounds all of these and in <b>avians</b> successively merges with the allantois in the later stages of egg development to form a combined respiratory and excretory organ called the chorioallantois.|$|R
25|$|Ixodes holocyclus {{emerged from}} this survey as the {{dominant}} acarine ectoparasite of mammals and <b>avians</b> in the study area, its population dwarfing those of other tick species, and various species of mites.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBrain {{membrane}} preparations {{of different}} vertebrates were photoaffinity labeled with [3 H]flunitrazepam and subsequently deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F and peptide N-glycopeptidase. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography revealed that each benzodiazepine-binding protein is deglycosylated in two steps, indicating that each protein has two glycosylation sites. Species {{variation of the}} apparent molecular masses of the benzodiazepine-binding proteins and regional heterogeneity in <b>avians</b> persist after deglycosylation. These {{results indicate that the}} α-subunit(s) of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor has undergone electrophoretically detectable changes in its amino acid composition during vertebrate evolution. The existence of at least two different α-subunits in <b>avians</b> is further substantiated...|$|R
5|$|Until the 1950s, {{screening}} of anti-malarial drugs {{was carried out}} on <b>avian</b> malaria. <b>Avian</b> malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of Plasmodium berghei in wild rodents in the Congo and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain. Plasmodium cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{were used in the}} 1960s to test drugs active against P. vivax.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by <b>avian</b> kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with <b>avian</b> malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E

50|$|Zoopht - large <b>avians</b> (about {{the size}} and shape of an ostrich). Their wings have evolved into arms. Capable {{mechanics}} and engineers. Ruled by the Three, each of which has domain over different areas of government and military.|$|R
50|$|The Kiesha'ra Series {{is a set}} of five fantasy novels {{written by}} the young adult author, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, which focus on several races of shapeshifters, {{including}} the <b>avians</b> (bird people), the serpiente (snake people), and the shm'Ahnmik (falcon people).|$|R
5|$|Banksia inflorescences are {{energy-rich}} {{sources of}} food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item {{of the endangered}} mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis), {{as well as many}} other mammals and birds. <b>Avian</b> species observed visiting the flower spikes include the bridled honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} are curated repositories of scientific specimens consisting {{of birds and}} their parts. They are a research resource for ornithology, the science of birds, and for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds is useful. These {{collections are}} archives of <b>avian</b> diversity and serve the diverse needs of scientific researchers, artists, and educators.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era <b>avian</b> life {{includes}} the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
50|$|The <b>avians</b> and serpiente have warred for {{thousands}} of years. At {{the start of the}} series in Hawksong, the royal families of both sides have been nearly decimated while their respective societies and cultures slip further and further into decay.|$|R
50|$|The {{three men}} are a blatant {{example of the}} {{differences}} between serpiente and <b>avians.</b> A vision of the future. Oliza can feel Nicias step in with his magic to keep the spell under control before she is lost in visions.|$|R
50|$|Vaults {{have been}} {{identified}} in mammals, amphibians, <b>avians</b> and Dictyostelium discoideum. The Vault model used by the Pfam database identifies homologues in Paramecium tetraurelia, Kinetoplastida, many vertebrates, a cnidarian (starlet sea anemone), molluscs, Trichoplax adhaerens, flatworms, Echinococcus granulosus and Choanoflagellate.|$|R
