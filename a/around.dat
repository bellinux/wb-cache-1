5|$|Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria {{estimates}} <b>around</b> 1915; Birnberg's biographical {{survey of}} Indigenous artists from central Australia gives a birth date of <b>around</b> 1920; The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art suggests <b>around</b> 1922; Elizabeth Fortescue's biographical essay in Art of Utopia offers a range between 1910 and 1920. The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth {{by comparison with}} other events, especially for those born before contact with European Australians. Minnie was one of six children, and had three sisters: Molly, born <b>around</b> 1920, Emily, born <b>around</b> 1922, and Galya, born in the 1930s. She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre Aboriginal language groups.|$|E
5|$|Five star {{systems have}} been found to have planets, four of which have been {{discovered}} by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in Chile. HD 4308 is a star with <b>around</b> 83% of the Sun's mass located 72 light-years away with a super-Earth planet with an orbital period of <b>around</b> 15 days. HD 215497 is an orange star of spectral type K3V <b>around</b> 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet <b>around</b> the size of Saturn with a period of <b>around</b> 567 days. HD 221287 has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a super-Jovian planet. HD 7199 has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a planet with <b>around</b> 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. HD 219077 has a planet <b>around</b> 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a highly eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values <b>around</b> 700nm (<b>around</b> 0.009), while they differ significantly <b>around</b> 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} <b>around</b> 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be <b>around</b> 0.002).|$|E

5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power <b>around</b> regional centers: Western Europe <b>around</b> Brussels, the Western Hemisphere <b>around</b> Washington, D.C., East Asia <b>around</b> Beijing, and Eastern Europe <b>around</b> Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures <b>around</b> 29°C (84°F) and nights <b>around</b> 12°C (54°F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures <b>around</b> 41°C (106°F) and nights no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} the monsoon temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are <b>around</b> 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are <b>around</b> 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|A Paleolithic culture <b>around</b> 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from <b>around</b> 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. <b>Around</b> 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting <b>around</b> 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend the area <b>around</b> a grazing animal against {{others of the}} same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage <b>around</b> species that move at <b>around</b> 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E

5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated <b>around</b> the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador <b>around</b> San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions <b>around</b> San Pedro, and outlying areas <b>around</b> Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} <b>around</b> 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart Iron Works in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed <b>around</b> the church's cemetery. Electrical conduits {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified <b>around</b> 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. <b>Around</b> 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by White’s Ornamental Ironworks.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia <b>around</b> 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan <b>around</b> 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps <b>around</b> 3,000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed <b>around</b> Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits <b>around</b> Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet <b>around</b> Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Around</b> 120,000 prisoners {{from the}} French colonies were {{captured}} during the Battle of France. Most of these troops, <b>around</b> two-thirds, {{came from the}} French North African possessions of Tunisia, Morocco and, particularly, Algeria. <b>Around</b> 20 percent were from French West Africa. The rest were from Madagascar and Indochina. Influenced by Nazi racial ideology, German troops summarily killed between 1,000 and 1,500 black prisoners during the Battle of France. Among those captured who narrowly escaped execution was Léopold Sédar Senghor, an academic who would become the first President of independent Senegal in 1960.|$|E

5|$|<b>Around</b> 1733 Bach {{transposed}} his Latin Magnificat to Dmajor (BWV243). Besides transposing, he also {{applied a}} few modifications: {{for instance in}} the movement that has Luke1:54 as text he replaced the trumpet as performer of the cantus firmus by two oboes. <b>Around</b> a decade later Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably <b>around</b> the same time Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E
