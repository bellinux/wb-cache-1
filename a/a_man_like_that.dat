25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> from the firing -line.|$|E
500|$|... "Si Una Vez" [...] {{is written}} in the key of D minor and is played in a {{moderate}} groove of 84 beats per minute. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano and guitar. Lyrically, Selena reminiscences her failed relationship and wonders why she ever {{fell in love with}} an abusive partner who betrayed and left her, vowing to never allow <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> back into her life. The lyrics suggest unrequited love and female empowerment.|$|E

60|$|RENCH. We'd {{have agreed}} to put it off. When <b>a</b> young <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is near dying for his country why--anything can wait. But what we're asking is only right.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops {{a little more of}} the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. There must be something very wrong in the state of things that makes <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Best Line or Quote – [...] "You know, Sunshine, {{you need}} to find <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to marry. Someone so well-hung that even after three or four kids, he'd still be wall to wall." [...] (Night Embrace by Sherrilyn Kenyon) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} known that would set Uncle Cal going. Of course, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> him, <b>that</b> knew {{everything}} about everything, would look at that as a reflection on his attainments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody knows {{anything}} about him. I don't see what Soames wants with <b>a</b> young <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I shouldn't be surprised if Irene had put her oar in. I shall speak to...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John, it {{is decided}} now; I am sure of it. I {{feel that it}} is all gone. <b>A</b> careful <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> would never have spoken as he did, unless he was sure. It will be all yours, John." ...|$|R
2500|$|The noted American author John Dos Passos {{joined the}} {{committee}} and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen. Dos Passos concluded it [...] "barely possible" [...] that Sacco might have committed murder {{as part of a}} class war, but that the soft-hearted Vanzetti was clearly innocent. [...] "Nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> along," [...] Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti. After the executions, the Committee continued its work, helping to gather material that eventually appeared as The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti.|$|E
2500|$|Both wrote {{dozens of}} letters asserting their innocence, insisting {{they had been}} framed because they were anarchists. Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> along." [...] Vanzetti developed his command of English {{to such a degree that}} journalist Murray Kempton later described him as [...] "the greatest writer of English in our century to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The fact is, Tifto, {{you don't}} make enough out of it. When <b>a</b> small <b>man</b> <b>like</b> you {{has to deal}} with <b>a</b> big <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> he may take it out of him in one of two ways. But he must be deuced clever if he can get it both ways." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, {{from your}} {{experience}} in such matters, Mr. Slippen, {{where do you}} think that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> would be likely to go?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, have it {{your own}} way. Personally, I wouldn't trust <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> And, as for letting my {{daughter}} marry his son...!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{as to the}} place,' {{continued}} Mervyn, 'you {{could not}} put it into better hands to get your {{people out of their}} Old World ways. <b>A</b> young <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> used to farming, and with steam and mechanics at his fingers' ends, will make us all look about us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{do you mean}} by {{drinking}} two tumblers of such staggering stuff at one o'clock in the day in the house of <b>a</b> dangerous <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> I am very sorry I went into the fellow's place.

6000|$|... "But Ayala {{does not}} want him. Ayala despises him. It is too hard that she is to lose {{everything}} because <b>a</b> young <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> will go on making himself disagreeable.

60|$|BARTHWICK. Tcha! Of {{course he}} took it too! <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Jones will {{make the most of}} it. It'll get into the papers.|$|E

6000|$|... "How can {{you believe}} that? You're a college girl, mother tells me. Don't the belief in these things wipe out {{everything}} you have been taught at school?

60|$|Now, when <b>a</b> <b>man</b> feels <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it is {{impossible}} to restrain him long. For a week Mortimer Sturgis's soul sizzled within him: then he could contain himself no longer. One night, at one of the informal dances at the hotel, he drew the girl out on to the moonlit terrace.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{meanwhile}} {{had thought}} it out. [...] "Then he has something to be careful of; it would take something really handsome to inspire in <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> him <b>that</b> sort of interest.

6000|$|... "False {{and cold}} and heartless," [...] thought Beatrice. [...] "I wonder how <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> could marry her; {{and how much he}} loves her." ...|$|E

6000|$|Milton {{walked over}} to the boarding-houses with Clowes and Trevor. He was full of the match, {{particularly}} of the iniquity of Rand-Brown.
