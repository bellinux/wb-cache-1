40|$|Abstract—Mobile <b>application</b> <b>markets</b> thrive, {{yet they}} are held back from their full {{potential}} by the information asymmetry between application developers and application consumers. A consumer has no way to gauge the security or reliability of an application, and a developer has no way to differentiate his application {{from that of the}} competition based on these factors. We argue that the centralized nature of mobile <b>application</b> <b>markets,</b> such as Android Market and the iOS App Store, afford them a unique opportunity to gather and present information. We discuss a number of ideas to leverage this opportunity to eliminate information asymmetry, including third-party certifications, qualitative descriptions of attack surface, and aggregated usage data.
