The validity and reliability of the Denison Organizational Culture Survey was examined in a South African context for the first time. High correlations between the cultural traits suggested that the items were measuring a single trait rather than four distinguishable traits. Correlations above the 0. 50 level between some subscales (team orientation, agreement, customer focus, core values and vision) and certain financial ratios were obtained. However, the results were regarded as tentative, because statistical significance was not reached for most of the correlations. The cultural trait consistency was significantly correlated with two of the four profitability ratios...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of managers’ emotional intelligence (EI) has been advocated as fundamental {{to their success}} as leaders. Despite the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) {{being one of the}} most widely applied psychological measures of personality type in leadership development, there is inconclusive evidence on the relationship between personality type and EI. This study examined the relationship between personality preference types and emotional intelligence (EI) in a sample of 1 121 employees in a South <b>African</b> <b>investment</b> <b>bank.</b> Instruments for data collection included the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Bar-On Emotional Intelligence Quotient (Bar-On EQ-i). Data were analyzed utilizing one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the effects of personality preference types on EI. Findings suggest a significant, positive relationship between overall EI and the personality preferences of extroversion, thinking and judging. The feeling preference affected interpersonal EI positively. Intuitive-thinking personality types showed significantly higher intrapersonal and mood EI subcomponent scores and sensing-feeling personality types demonstrated significantly lower EI subcomponent scores for intrapersonal and stress tolerance. Findings suggest that areas for EI development can be inferred from MBTI personality type preferences. Aligning coaching and development with personality preferences present valuable EI development alternatives. Industrial and Organisational Psycholog...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{growth in}} the {{unsecured}} lending market and the bankruptcy of <b>African</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Investments</b> Limited have brought to light concerns regarding credit extension {{and the level of}} household indebtedness in South Africa. This study seeks to investigate the relevant aspects of credit extension in both the secured and unsecured lending markets by firstly analysing contemporary literature and then conducting a more formal empirical analysis. A VAR model is estimated to examine the effects household disposable income and interest rates have on the level of household debt in South Africa for the period 1995 Q 1 - 2015 Q 3. The empirical results indicate that there is no significant deterministic relationship between household disposable income and household debt. However, the results show that such a relationship does exist between interest rate and household debt. Finally, impulse response functions obtained from the VAR estimation are examined which indicate that both shocks too household disposable income and interest rates effect the level of household debt, but that this effect returns to equilibrium within six periods...|$|R
