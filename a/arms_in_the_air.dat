5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and spanner wrench tied together with a rope.

25|$|Games 4 and 5 {{were the}} most {{controversial}} of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of game 4, saw their 11-point fourth quarter lead dwindle away, to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left, Robert Horry bodychecked Steve Nash in which he threw his <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> into the scorers table. Nash's teammates jumped to his defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench heading toward the altercation. Their action violated NBA rules, resulting in the decision by league commissioner David Stern to suspend both players for game 5 (Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Nash). In game 5, played in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early and enjoyed a 16-point lead on the Spurs, but in a reversal of game 4, this time the Spurs came back {{in the final seconds}} and won the game 88–85, giving San Antonio a 3–2 series lead.|$|E

500|$|Musically, The Altar and the Door {{has more}} {{influence}} from rock {{as compared to}} the group's earlier efforts, which had influences from AC and pop.

The album mixes up-tempo, guitar driven songs with [...] "anthemic, <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> tracks".

2500|$|In {{the second}} jump, Ammann again landed the longest jump, {{reaching}} {{a distance of}} 108 meters. After Ammann landed the jump, he immediately began pumping his <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> confident that he had secured the gold medal. Uhrmann, second after the first round, {{was one of the}} few competitors who had a shorter jump in the final round, placing tenth in the final round and fifth overall. Among the jumpers who surpassed him was Adam Małysz, who again took third place in the final round and finished in second overall, winning the silver medal. The bronze was won by Gregor Schlierenzauer, whose significantly better performance in the final round netted him second place for the round and third overall. Schlierenzauer's second jump was a full five meters longer than his first, the single largest improvement between the two rounds by any competitor. [...] Uhrmann's fifth-place finish was the top result by an athlete not pre-qualified for the competition round.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. The video opens with a scene of Stefani spending time with her Harajuku Girls, when a crowd of students appears. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd. Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and {{when they go to}} a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and other food products down an aisle. Throughout the video, there are intercut sequences of choreographed dancing filmed in a sound stage, intended to represent Stefani's imagination. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are outfitted in cheerleading uniforms, accompanied by several Californian spirit groups: the Orange Crush All Stars, a cheerleading squad from Orange County; a marching band from Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley; a pep flag team named the Carson High School Flaggies from Carson; and a drill team from Stephen M. White Middle School in Carson. To visualize the song's bridge, the Harajuku Girls spell the word [...] "bananas" [...] with cue cards.

2500|$|Sagan {{demonstrated}} {{good form}} {{once again in}} the World Tour classified Tour de Suisse by winning four stages and the points classification jersey. He kicked things off with a somewhat surprising win in the opening prologue, besting local favorite and time trial specialist Fabian Cancellara (...) by 4 seconds over the [...] course. The second stage was not suited for him since it was a mountainous affair, but he did prevail on stage 3, in a thrilling finish where the bunch caught the final two escapees inside the final kilometer. The asphalt was wet with rain and Sagan's foot came out of his pedal in one of the last bend, but he managed to stay upright and pass 's Baden Cooke before the line, <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and wearing the white jersey awarded to the best sprinter. The very next day, he took his third victory in four days, once again in rainy conditions. With about 350 metres to go, Marcus Burghardt of [...] launched a sprint for the finish line. Sagan jumped out of his teammate's wheel to get into Burghardt's slipstream and sailed past him to take the win. He thanked his team for their efforts afterward, especially Moreno Moser, who [...] "shut down every attack {{at the end of the}} race, letting me do the sprint I wanted; big thanks to Moreno and I hope I can return the favour soon." [...] The next win came on stage 6, the last stage of the Tour which was suited to the sprinters. The final kilometres in Bischofszell were filled with urban obstacles such as roundabouts and sharp bends, and Sagan stayed with the head of the bunch. With 200 metres to go, Sagan took a left bend with a small patch of cobbles in it at full speed. He scraped the barriers as he came out of the corner with 's Michael Albasini on his left, and sprinted his way to victory. When asked about the seemingly close call he had in the aforementioned turn, the Slovak answered: [...] "The finishes in the Tour de Suisse are never straight so you need to invent something to find some space [...] ".|$|E
