Plant essential oils have gained importance as alternative remedies {{for treatment of}} many infectious diseases and food preservatives. In the present study, we have determined the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) from two Indian spices Cuminum cyminum (cumin) and Trachyspermum ammi (<b>ajowan)</b> of family Apiaceae by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Moreover, the antimicrobial potential of these oils was evaluated against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. A Total of 20 major chemical components were analyzed by GC-MS studies and {{were found to be}} cuminaldehyde (36. 67 %) and caren- 10 -al (21. 34 %) in case of cumin essential oil while p-cymene (15. 54 %) and thymol (15. 48 %) were found to be present in <b>ajowan</b> essential oil. Both the EOs exhibited potent antibacterial effect against most of the tested pathogens. Furthermore, cumin and <b>ajowan</b> EOs demonstrated remarkable antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi with an inhibition zone diameter of 54 and 60 mm respectively with identical MIC value of 12. 5 µl/ml. <b>Ajowan</b> EO was found to exhibit wide spectrum activity against both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms when compared with cumin.

40|$|Introduction Conventional {{operations}} in fields, {{soil and water}} management are not efficient and loss of and damage to the environment are considerable (Lal, 2000). Crop diversity and understanding the complex interactions between environmental and socioeconomic factors are approaches to make better use of limited resources (Tengberg et al., 1998). The most diverse ecosystems have a higher production under environment stress conditions compared with ecosystems with low diversity due to the better efficiency {{in the use of}} water, radiation and nutrients (Hulugalle & al, 1986; Walker & Ogindo, 2003). Materials and Methods In order to investigate the effects of crop diversity and nutrient source on resource use efficiency, a split plot experiment was conducted based on complete randomized blocks with 3 replications at the Agricultural Research Station, the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during 2006 and 2007. The treatments included manure and chemical fertilizers as the main plots and intercropping of 3 soybean varieties (Williams, Sahar and Gorgan 3), intercropping of 3 Millet species (common millet, foxtail millet and pearl millet), intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame (Sesamum indicum) and intercropping of millet, sesame, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and <b>ajowan</b> (Trachyspermum ammi) as sub plots. Results and Discussion The results indicated that in the first year, intercropping of 3 Millet species and intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame showed the highest water use efficiency (WUE) based on biological yield. In the second year, intercropping of 3 millet species showed the highest WUE based on biological yield. The highest concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in crop tissues were observed in intercropping of 3 soybean varieties and intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame. In the first year, intercropping of 3 soybean varieties showed the highest nutrient use efficiency (NUE). In the second year, intercropping of 3 soybean varieties, intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame and intercropping of millet, sesame, fenugreek and <b>ajowan</b> showed the highest NUE. In the two years, intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame and intercropping of millet, sesame, fenugreek and <b>ajowan</b> showed the highest nitrogen and phosphorus absorption efficiency (NAE). Intercropping of millet, soybean and sesame showed the highest potassium uptake efficiency. In this study, nutrient resource did not {{have a significant effect on}} water and nutrient use efficiency. The research results have indicated that often nitrogen amount and use efficiency in legume and non legume intercropping were higher than monocultures. This indicates the synergist effect in the intercroppings (Vandermeer, 1989; Szumigalski & Van Acker, 2006). In general, the different benefits of diversity and better use of available inputs are obtained by increasing the diversity of crops and proper selection of plants cultivated in intercropping systems and crop rotations in monoculture systems Acknowledgments This research (044 p) was funded by the Vice Chancellor for Research of the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, which is hereby acknowledged...|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple apparatus is described for extracting essential oils from aromatic plant material by atmospheric solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) without {{the addition of}} any solvent or water. Isolation and concentration of volatile compounds were performed by a single stage. The product solutions of volatile compounds were directly analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The essential oils from aromatic herbs (basil, crispate mint, thyme) and spices (<b>ajowan,</b> cumin, star anise) extracted by SFME for 30 minutes and 1 hour, {{were similar to those}} obtained by conventional hydro-distillation (HD) for (respectively) 4 and 8 hours. Substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes hydrocarbons are present in the essential oils of the aromatic plants extracted by SFME in comparison with HD. Solvent-free microwave extraction is clearly advantageous to conventional distillation in terms of rapidity, efficiency, cleanliness, substantial saving of energy, and is environmentally friendly...|$|E
40|$|Normally the {{productivity}} of cropping systems in arid and semi- arid regions is very low. The sustainable agricultural systems {{try to find out}} environmental friendly technologies based on physical and biological treatments to increase crop production. In this study two irrigation treatments (control and water stress) and six methods of fertilizer treatment (control, NPK-F, using magnetic band- M, using silver nano particles- N, M+N and M+N+ 50 % F) on performance of <b>ajowan</b> were compared. Results showed that treatments with magnetic field or base fertilizer had more yield compared to the control and silver nanoparticles (N) treatments. Application of silver nanoparticles had no positive effect on yield. The highest seed and biomass WUE achieved in base fertilizer or magnetic field treatments. Under water stress treatment, seed WUE significantly increased. In conclusion magnetic field exposure, probably by encourage nutrient uptake efficiency could be applied to reduce fertilizer requirement. On the other hand the cultivation of plants under low MF could be an alternative way of WUE improving...|$|E
40|$|Recently much {{attention}} has been paid to the application of microemulsion as drug delivery system. Part of this interest appears as a consequence of their transparency, ease of preparation and long-term stability. These properties as well as their ability for incorporating drugs of different lipophilicity are some of the reasons why microemulsions have been thoroughly considered for pharmaceutical purpose. The aim of the present study is to improve the solubility of Terbinafine Hydrochloride, a slightly water-soluble antifungal drug by formulating a microemulsion made up of oil, surfactant and solubilizing agent/cosolvent. Tween 80, <b>ajowan</b> oil and peppermint oil were selected for preparing a microemulsion. Propylene glycol (PG) was used as a solubilizing agent.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop an}} in vitro {{regeneration}} system {{to increase the}} recovery of Carum copticum L. plantlets {{as a part of}} developing a metabolic engineering program. Methods: The efficacy of different concentrations and combinations of 6 -benzyladenine, indole- 3 -acetic acid and indole butyric acid on direct shoot regeneration and rooting of <b>ajowan</b> from apical bud explants were assessed. All explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different combinations of 6 -benzyl amino purine (BAP) (0, 2. 2, 4. 4, 8. 8 μmol/L) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) (0, 0. 5, 1. 1, 2. 2 μmol/L). Results: The maximum shoot regeneration frequency (97. 5 %) and the highest number of shoots produced from apical buds (34 shoots per explant) were obtained on MS medium fortified with BAP (4. 4 μmol/L) and IAA (0. 5 μmol/L). Low shoot regeneration frequency was observed in BAP free treatments. The effects of different strengths of MS medium and various concentrations of IAA and indole- 3 -butyric acid on rooting rate, length and average number of roots were also investigated. Application of indole- 3 -butyric acid (6 μmol/L) in full-strength MS medium, was more effective than IAA and resulted in highest shoot regeneration frequency with the rooting rate of 100 % and highest mean number of roots per shoot (41. 8). The rooted plantlets were acclimatized successfully in greenhouse conditions with a survival rate of 90 %. Conclusion: In this study, a simple and reliable regeneration and acclimatization protocol for Carum copticum has been presented. This protocol can be found very advantageous for a variety of purposes, including mass multiplication of Carum species, medicinal plant breeding studies and transgenic plant production...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases is increasing at a worrisome rate globally. Diabetes mellitus {{is known to}} occur due to high blood glucose levels, caused by defects in insulin levels. Adult on-set type II diabetes, which is closely associated with obesity, {{is reported to be}} 90 - 95 % of all diabetic cases and linked to diet and lifestyle factors. A large population of the developed and developing countries is now being effected by this epidemic. Natural sources of phenolic antioxidants and inhibitors of digestive enzymes from food sources have potential for low cost dietary management of type II diabetes. Therefore, the main focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate, develop and design effective dietary strategies based on a combination of Chilean potatoes and herb synergies for the management of hyperglycemia and hypertension linked to type II diabetes. Antioxidant, antihypertensive and anti-hyperglycemic potentials of Chilean potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum L.), herbs from the Apiaceae (Dill, <b>Ajowan,</b> Fennel, Caraway, Coriander and Anise) and Lamiaceae (Sage and Marjoram) families were evaluated, with a goal to target a new dietary management strategy for early stages of type II diabetes through lowering of hyperglycemia and related complications of hypertension The results indicated a high correlation between total phenolic content and total antioxidant activity in several Chilean potato varieties evaluated, which indicates that certain phenolic compounds may be responsible for high antioxidant activity. Also, certain varieties of Chilean potato had antihypertensive potentials, with ACE inhibition upto 88 %. The -glucosidase inhibition relevant for hyperglycemia management for Apiaceae family ranged upto 50 % (Dill) for aqueous extracts. A high correlation (r = 0. 86) was observed between -glucosidase inhibition and total phenolic content for aqueous extracts of all species investigated in the Apiaceae family. A high rosmarinic acid activity was observed in aqueous extracts of Lamiaceae family, which ranged upto 39. 7 mg/g of sample dry weight (DW). This suggests that high phenolic content and associated antioxidant activity found in sage and marjoram is dominated by rosmarinic acid. High enzyme inhibitory activities, reflecting in vitro anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive potentials indicates that consumption of these food sources in our diet would prove to be beneficial towards our health. Further in vivo studies for type II diabetes-linked functionalities of these natural sources of antioxidants and inhibitors would confirm the human health benefits achieved through dietary intake...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Unbalanced {{application}} of fertilizer and chemical pesticides reduce soil fertility and agricultural products quality. Application of bio-fertilizers is quite important for sustainable agriculture [...] According {{to the principles}} of ecological agriculture, soil fertility and plant nutrition {{play an important role in}} improving the yield and quality of medicinal plants. The use of biological fertilizers is one of the main strategies in ecological agriculture for plant nutrition. Organic materials are not the only source of bio-fertilizer but bacterial and fungal particles and materials from their activities in relation to nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients are examples of biological fertilizers too. Today particular attention has been paid to the canvas of biological nitrogen fixation byfree-living bacteria such as Azospirillum and Azotobacter companion agricultural systems. Nitrogen is mainly the first nutrient which its deficiency in the arid and semi-aridoccurs. It is due to this fact thatthe amount of organic matter that is the major source of nitrogen stored in these areas is negligible. Nitroxin contains the most effective nitrogen fixation bacteria (Azotobacter and Azospirillum). Nitroxin bacteria besides nitrogen fixation of atmosphere and counterbalance of macronutrients and micro nutrientsare required for plant uptake, with the synthesis and secretion of various hormones and growth regulators such as auxin (IAA), the secretion of various amino acids, antibiotics, andhydrogen cyanide hydrogen will cause siderophore growth and development of roots and aerial parts of the plant. Due to environmental concerns, the use of organic acids to improve the quality and quantity of crops and gardens is not possible. Small amounts of organic acids have significant impacts on physical characteristics, chemical and biological soil because of the useful hormonal effects of compounds in increasing production and improving the quality of agricultural products. Humic acid, as one of the appropriate fertilizer, is used in the agricultural organic system. Humic acid causes shoot growth increase due to the absorption of calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, iron, zinc and copper. Bio-fertilizer application information on medicinal plants is very important. In the present study, nitroxin and humic acid effects on Carumcopticum extract were investigated. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the effect of different levels of humic acid, organic fertilizer and Nitroxin bio-fertilizer on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of <b>Ajowan,</b> a factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design with three replications was conducted in Zabol University. The seeds used in this study were obtained from a local variety that was planted superficially. Active ingredientof the seed was extracted by distillation with water for threehours. Essence percentage was determined by sodium sulfate. The Kejeldal method was used to determine the percentage of nitrogen. The crude method was used to determine the concentration of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium in dry ash. A factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design with three replications was conducted at the Research Farm. Treatments include the seed inoculation with Nitroxin bio-fertilizer in fourlevels including N 1 = zero (control), N 2 = 0. 5, N 3 = 1 and N 4 = 1. 5 L/ha and organic fertilizer humic acid as irrigation water solublefour-leaf stage on fourlevels H 1 = zero (control), H 2 = 1, H 3 = 2 and H 4 = 3 kg per hectare.
