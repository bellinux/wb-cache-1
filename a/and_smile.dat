According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E

Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> from the Streets You Hold (1997).

His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was released in 2001. A fourth album with the Chili Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium.

25|$|In late 1985, Roth {{assembled}} a virtuoso solo band, consisting of guitarist Steve Vai (previously of Frank Zappa's band), bassist Billy Sheehan (previously of Talas), and drummer Gregg Bissonette (previously of Maynard Ferguson's big band). With veteran Van Halen producer Ted Templeman producing, Roth released his debut solo LP, Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> in July 1986. The album saw Roth return to hard rock music, but also incorporated {{some of his}} more eclectic musical tastes, ranging from jazz to speed metal. Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> met with widespread commercial and critical success, charting at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200, and selling over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Roth and his band toured arenas extensively in support of Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> (see Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> Tour), {{before returning to the}} studio in 1987 to record a follow-up.|$|E

500|$|She next starred {{opposite}} Ajay Devgn in Anees Bazmee's {{romantic comedy}} Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, {{a remake of}} the Hollywood hit French Kiss. In the film, she played the comic role of Sanjana, a clumsy woman who travels from Paris to India in search of her philandering fiancé, however, falls for another man, played by Devgn. A review from Planet Bollywood noted, [...] "Kajol, like usual, is brilliant {{in her role as}} Sanjana. She makes you cry, laugh, get angry, <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> all within the two and a half hour movie. Her acting is on par with Meg Ryan in the English flick". The film emerged as a [...] "super-hit" [...] commercially and fetched Kajol a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare that year.|$|E
500|$|Love {{does not}} deny expressing {{reservations}} with the lyrics of Pet Sounds <b>and</b> <b>Smile,</b> but believes that the [...] "formula" [...] quote crystallizes a reductive [...] "morality tale" [...] that positions Wilson as [...] "the tormented genius who was undone by his own family", a theme which appears throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers". During the 1960s, [...] "The Beach Boys" [...] and [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] were synonymous entities, and Wilson was expected to fulfill the band's commercial interests. When he explored creative avenues that contrasted the Beach Boys' signature conventions, it was negatively received by fans and critics who wished that Wilson {{would return to the}} group's early style. This prevailing attitude changed after the 1970s, as rock music journalists started valuing the band's experimental work over their early records.|$|E

Later, Jack tells Liz that she is the female version of former Boston Celtics basketball player Kevin McHale. Jack's Boston office is a duplication of his New York one. When Liz enters, Jack asks her if she can tell which seven items are different, prompting the two to look into the camera <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> and thus breaking the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience.

500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business. [...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it seems very much like Mike.

[...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Before Leno's {{recording}} debut, {{music hall}} comedian Harry Bluff had recorded {{a number of}} Leno's songs, which were marketed by the Edison Bell Company in London in 1898. [...] Leno was initially reluctant to adopt the new medium of sound recording, but he was eventually enticed into the studio with a lucrative commission of one shilling (£4.15 in 2012) per dozen discs sold. [...] His records sold for five shillings each (£20.75 in 2012) and ran for three minutes. Some of the recorded songs differed from Leno's music hall versions by being condensed to incorporate part of the sketch from which the song was taken. [...] It is unknown how many discs were sold, because no record was ever kept of their sales. [...] Despite {{the success of the}} recordings and the praise he received from the record distributors, Leno felt uncomfortable in the recording studio. [...] In an interview for Pearson's Magazine in 1903, he stated: [...] "How the dickens can I patter and warble to that thing.

500|$|Having {{attended}} the concerts six months before, Ed Kelleher of Circus magazine {{was relieved to}} discover that the live album didn't just do justice to the [...] "magic... the sheer joy" [...] of the event, but rather its music [...] "practically jumps right out into your life". After singling out as defining moments Dylan's [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] ("it's enough to make you cry <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> at once"), Russell's medley and Harrison's [...] "Here Comes the Sun", along with the talents of Shankar– [...] "the most masterful and accomplished of them all"– Kelleher admitted to the futility of trying to identify [...] "individual highlights" [...] on an album that was [...] "one consistent high". In fact, almost every selection on the three-record set was named as a highlight by one reviewer or another: Preston's [...] "That's the Way God Planned It" [...] coming as a [...] "sheer delight" [...] to Landau, Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] especially [...] "delicate and moving" [...] to Playboys album reviewer, Dylan's [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] resonating most with Nicholas Schaffner, while to Richard Williams, [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] was [...] "the masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} an overall positive response from critics and was particularly noted for the theme and for Mamatha Bhukya's performance. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film {{a score of}} 85% based on 26 critic reviews with an average rating of 7/10. Roger Ebert described Bhukya as [...] "a natural star, her eyes <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> illuminating a face of freshness and delight." [...] Writing about Vanaja, he added that [...] "there are the glorious colors of saris and room decorations, the dazzle of dance costumes and the dusty landscape that somehow becomes a watercolor by Edward Lear, with its hills and vistas, its oxen and elephants, its houses that seem part of the land. In this setting, Domalpalli tells his story with tender precision, and never an awkward moment." [...] Ebert listed it {{among the top five}} foreign films of 2007. According to Laura Kern from The New York Times, the film [...] "is a coming-of-age tale that is engrossing, if slightly overlong, and absolutely timeless, unfolding against an antiquated class system that sadly stands firm in rural areas of India to this day." ...|$|E

She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa.

Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, [...] "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> and they used to say, ‘give us a blank look.’ It was really difficult, not to smile". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles. Her first role was of an extra in the comedy drama Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006).|$|E

Bush's [...] "imaginative" [...] video sampler accompanies her greatest hits album {{of the same name}} and includes music videos for songs throughout her career to that point. The music video for [...] "Land of Confusion", a song included on the band's 1986 album Invisible Touch, contained Spitting Image puppets of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and other notable individuals. David Lee Roth's self-titled video consisted of promotional clips created for his debut solo EP Crazy from the Heat and album Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile.</b> Jackson's video collection, which was certified gold in the United States, contained six promotional videos recorded for singles from her album Control.

500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite a bit of time is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still ask me how to fill that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> onto Hugh Jackman's body — with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
