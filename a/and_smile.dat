According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation.

Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E

Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

500|$|She next starred {{opposite}} Ajay Devgn in Anees Bazmee's {{romantic comedy}} Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, {{a remake of}} the Hollywood hit French Kiss. In the film, she played the comic role of Sanjana, a clumsy woman who travels from Paris to India in search of her philandering fianc√©, however, falls for another man, played by Devgn. A review from Planet Bollywood noted, [...] "Kajol, like usual, is brilliant {{in her role as}} Sanjana. She makes you cry, laugh, get angry, <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> all within the two and a half hour movie. Her acting is on par with Meg Ryan in the English flick".

500|$|Love {{does not}} deny expressing {{reservations}} with the lyrics of Pet Sounds <b>and</b> <b>Smile,</b> but believes that the [...] "formula" [...] quote crystallizes a reductive [...] "morality tale" [...] that positions Wilson as [...] "the tormented genius who was undone by his own family", a theme which appears throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers". During the 1960s, [...] "The Beach Boys" [...] and [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] were synonymous entities, and Wilson was expected to fulfill the band's commercial interests. When he explored creative avenues that contrasted the Beach Boys' signature conventions, it was negatively received by fans and critics who wished that Wilson {{would return to the}} group's early style. This prevailing attitude changed after the 1970s, as rock music journalists started valuing the band's experimental work over their early records.|$|E

500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business.

[...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just‚Äîsee, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Before Leno's {{recording}} debut, {{music hall}} comedian Harry Bluff had recorded {{a number of}} Leno's songs, which were marketed by the Edison Bell Company in London in 1898. [...] Leno was initially reluctant to adopt the new medium of sound recording, but he was eventually enticed into the studio with a lucrative commission of one shilling (¬£4.15 in 2012) per dozen discs sold. [...] His records sold for five shillings each (¬£20.75 in 2012) and ran for three minutes. Some of the recorded songs differed from Leno's music hall versions by being condensed to incorporate part of the sketch from which the song was taken. [...] It is unknown how many discs were sold, because no record was ever kept of their sales. [...] Despite {{the success of the}} recordings and the praise he received from the record distributors, Leno felt uncomfortable in the recording studio.

500|$|Having {{attended}} the concerts six months before, Ed Kelleher of Circus magazine {{was relieved to}} discover that the live album didn't just do justice to the [...] "magic... the sheer joy" [...] of the event, but rather its music [...] "practically jumps right out into your life". After singling out as defining moments Dylan's [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] ("it's enough to make you cry <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> at once"), Russell's medley and Harrison's [...] "Here Comes the Sun", along with the talents of Shankar‚Äì [...] "the most masterful and accomplished of them all"‚Äì Kelleher admitted to the futility of trying to identify [...] "individual highlights" [...] on an album that was [...] "one consistent high".

500|$|The film {{received}} an overall positive response from critics and was particularly noted for the theme and for Mamatha Bhukya's performance. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film {{a score of}} 85% based on 26 critic reviews with an average rating of 7/10. Roger Ebert described Bhukya as [...] "a natural star, her eyes <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> illuminating a face of freshness and delight." [...] Writing about Vanaja, he added that [...] "there are the glorious colors of saris and room decorations, the dazzle of dance costumes and the dusty landscape that somehow becomes a watercolor by Edward Lear, with its hills and vistas, its oxen and elephants, its houses that seem part of the land. In this setting, Domalpalli tells his story with tender precision, and never an awkward moment." [...] Ebert listed it {{among the top five}} foreign films of 2007. According to Laura Kern from The New York Times, the film [...] "is a coming-of-age tale that is engrossing, if slightly overlong, and absolutely timeless, unfolding against an antiquated class system that sadly stands firm in rural areas of India to this day." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite a bit of time is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still ask me how to fill that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> onto Hugh Jackman's body ‚Äî with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
