500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI worked very well for the first game. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, {{a lot of work}} done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players {{in the form of a}} persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{said that}} [...] "Born Free" [...] was [...] "an intense episode {{that brought the}} Ice Truck Killer story to a {{satisfying}} conclusion." [...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season will be just as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Daffam of the Grenfell Action Group said, “They didn’t give a {{stuff about}} us. We were the carcass {{and they were}} the vultures. North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn’t have to dig for the gold. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to marginalise the people who were living here, and that’s what they were doing.” ...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} imagine and invent {{relevant}} and effective strategies, which African and Asian nation-states and their institutions can use as instruments {{through which they}} can challenge the trends of megapoly of global capitalism, first of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> transform solidarity to an effective ideological foundation of their actions. The appropriate question is solidarity for what? The short answer is for building a peaceful and developmental region where poverty eradication is the main objective. Thus, this becomes an ideological construct. Second of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do the inventory of what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> as natural and social assets, and as skills. Third of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know one another through educational systems and other training programs. Fourth of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> set up their policy priorities based on their people’s living standards. Fifth of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> establish strong regional institutions through which decisions can be made collectively. And sixth of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deepen their own democracies. Furthermore, their concept of security <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be re-defined. It should go beyond militarism. It should include human security, which means the protection of social, political and economic rights, {{the protection of the}} eco-systems, and formulation and implementation of policies intended for the elimination of poverty.|$|R

2500|$|However, the railless {{architecture}} of the lei tai allowed a fighter to escape serious injury if they faced a more powerful opponent. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was leap down from the stage. This constituted a loss, but the boxer lived to fight another day. Despite this option, the Nationalist government banned the old traditions of private duels on the lei tai [...] in 1928 because too many people were dying.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, given Truman's sinking {{popularity}} and the Democratic Party's three-way split (between Truman, Henry A. Wallace, and Strom Thurmond), Dewey had seemed unstoppable. Republicans figured that <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to win was {{to avoid making}} any major mistakes, and as such Dewey did not take any risks. He spoke in platitudes, trying to transcend politics. Speech after speech was filled with empty statements of the obvious, such as the famous quote: [...] "You know that your future is still ahead of you." [...] An editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal summed it up: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ted Curson remembers, [...] "That really broke me up. When Eric {{got sick}} {{on that date}} , and him being black and a jazz musician, {{they thought he was}} a junkie. Eric didn't use any drugs. He was a {{diabetic}} – <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was take a blood test and they would have found that out. So he died for nothing. They gave him some detox stuff and he died, and nobody ever went into that club in Berlin again. That was the end of that club." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ziegfeld {{decided to}} base {{a scene in}} his next Follies on one of Duff Gordon's fashion shows and to use Duff Gordon's girls to model the clothes. Duff Gordon warned, [...] "But {{they do not know}} how to sing or dance, let alone talk." [...] Ziegfeld assured her that <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was walk and wear the clothes. Thus was invented the Show Girl, whose job, unlike the Chorus Girl, was simply to be {{beautiful}} and to model clothes. The Duff Gordon models were already trained in the Lucile Slither to which Ziegfeld added the Ziegfeld Walk, which enabled a girl to descend a staircase in full costume in such a way as to accentuate her natural attributes without appearing ungainly.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the demise}} of the Sr. Huskies, Durham decided to pursue a Junior hockey team. From the early days the team was dubbed the Huskies as well, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was find a league to play in. The Huskies had no chance to play in Junior Development as it was a league that {{depended}} on close locale and the closest team to Durham was Seaforth, over 80 kilometers away. They tried Jr. [...] "C" [...] and were turned down for political reasons involving the player drawing availability of potential rival teams: the Hanover Barons and Mount Forest Patriots. Midwestern Junior B and Provincial Jr. [...] "A" [...] did not work out either. As a last resort, the Huskies attempted to join the on-again off-again renegade Metro Junior A Hockey League.|$|E
2500|$|Woodhull {{learned how}} to {{infiltrate}} the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee. Woodhull argued that women already {{had the right to}} vote— <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was use it— since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens. The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members. [...] Learning of Woodhull's planned address, suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 National Woman Suffrage Association's third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Isabella Beecher Hooker, saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause. [...] They applauded her statement: [...] "omen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their rights." ...|$|E

60|$|By and by {{they reached}} a pretty villa, where they all left the {{carriage}} and followed the sugar king into the sugar house.

60|$|Out of the Smiling Pool {{and into}} the Laughing Brook, where the brown water flows smoothly, the three little {{swimmers}} towed the big green lily-pad. It floated along of itself now, and <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to steer it clear of rocks and old logs. Once it almost got away from them, {{on the edge of}} a tiny waterfall, but all three pulling together towed it out of danger. At last, in a dear little pool with a mossy green bank, they anchored the big green lily-pad.|$|E
60|$|And yet, when Bud Strothers {{came to see}} how she {{was getting}} along, she {{convinced}} him that all was well. One evening after work, Tom came, and forced two dollars upon her. He was terribly worried. He would like to help more, but Sarah was expecting another baby. There had been slack times in his trade because of the strikes in the other trades. He did not know what the country was coming to. And it was all so simple. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was see things in his way and vote the way he voted.

Me and Buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about Wall Street, but even we could see how the Golconda Gold Bond Investment Company was making money.

60|$|But {{here there}} were only good quiet beasts, lying about like the black hulls of sloops, and blowing {{every now and then}} jets of white steam, or {{sculling}} round with their huge mouths open, for the sea- moths to swim down their throats. There were no threshers there to thresh their poor old backs, or sword-fish to stab their stomachs, or saw-fish to rip them up, or ice-sharks to bite lumps out of their sides, or whalers to harpoon and lance them. They were quite safe and happy there; and <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to wait quietly in Peacepool, till Mother Carey sent for them to make them out of old beasts into new.|$|E

As soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep, broad river would spring up, which would hinder the witch's progress.
