2500|$|After {{the hearing}} opened, {{government}} counsel David Pannick stated {{in response to}} a question from Justice Johnson Lam that the government had no intention of seeking an interpretation before Lam had issued his decision, but reserved the possibility of doing so afterwards. In late September, the DAB renewed calls for the Hong Kong government to consider seeking an interpretation. There were further calls for an interpretation after the government's loss in the CFI. The New People's Party, headed by former Security for Secretary Regina Ip, also joined the calls for the government to seek interpretation. By 4 October, Ip and her two deputy party heads Michael Tien and Louis Shih had organised the gathering of 3,227 signatures in support of interpretation, which they presented to Ambrose Lee at a meeting with him; however, Lee stated that the government had no intention of seeking an interpretation in the short term. Basic Law Committee member Lau Nai-keung also wrote an editorial in the China Daily stating that the government should have made an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>interpretation</b> prior to the ruling, and should definitely make one before the case goes to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). However, after Lam declined to issue a stay of execution of his earlier judgment in late October, Alan Leong spoke out again against calls for a NPCSC interpretation, stating that Lam's ruling showed that the courts had recognised the Immigration Department's rights as [...] "gatekeepers" [...] and that there was no need for an interpretation.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental and analytical {{study of the}} hygric behaviour of mortar joints, with specific attention to the influences of the curing conditions. Capillary water uptake in masonry is visualized with the X-ray projection method and approximated with the sharp-front-theory. The results imply that the curing of the mortar between bricks modifies its hygric properties and introduces an interface resistance, with the effects proportional to the water extraction from the mortar during the curing. The presented study uses the analytical sharp-front theory to analyse the X-ray-visualised moisture content profiles. Validation of the sharp-front findings with independently determined hygric properties and interface resistances confirms {{the reliability of the}} approach.

40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput custom {{designed}} genotyping arrays are {{a valuable}} resource for biologically focused research studies and increasingly for validation of variation predicted by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. We investigate the Illumina GoldenGate chemistry using custom designed VeraCode and sentrix array matrix (SAM) assays {{for each of these}} applications, respectively. We highlight <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Illumina generated genotype cluster plots to maximise data inclusion and reduce genotyping errors. Findings We illustrate the dramatic effect of outliers in genotype calling and data interpretation, as well as suggest simple means to avoid genotyping errors. Furthermore we present this platform as a successful method for two-cluster rare or non-autosomal variant calling. The success of high-throughput technologies to accurately call rare variants will become an essential feature for future association studies. Finally, we highlight additional advantages of the Illumina GoldenGate chemistry in generating unusually segregated cluster plots that identify potential NGS generated sequencing error resulting from minimal coverage. Conclusions We demonstrate the importance of visually inspecting genotype cluster plots generated by the Illumina software and issue warnings regarding commonly accepted quality control parameters. In addition to suggesting applications to minimise data exclusion, we propose that the Illumina cluster plots may be helpful in identifying potential in-put sequence errors, particularly important for studies to validate NGS generated variation. </p...|$|R

Such a system needs to recognize and understand visual markings and their arrangement as presented in a diagram image. In that light, this thesis examines the practical possibility of a real world system for the automatic recognition and interpretation of machine-printed Finite State Automata diagrams. The suggested system uses known image processing and pattern recognition methods to extract the visual markings from the diagram image pixels. A second stage, to interpret the meaning of the diagram, is based on modeling the language of Finite State Automata diagrams using Constraint Multiset Grammars. Our results show that a practical <b>application</b> <b>for</b> automatic <b>interpretation</b> of Finite State Automata diagrams is possible.

The segmentation of the microcalcifications is performed using a fixed-tolerance region growing method to extract boundaries of calcifications with manually selected seed pixels. Taking into account that shapes and sizes of clustered microcalcifications have been associated with a high risk of carcinoma based on digerent subjective measures, such as whether or not the calcifications are irregular, linear, vermiform, branched, rounded or ring like, our efforts were addressed to obtain a feature set related to the shape.

40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{focuses on}} Jan Mukařovský´s concept of semantic gesture. The first chapter attempts to grasp {{it in the}} context of Prague School Structuralism, which constitutes the aesthetics and semantics basis of the concept. Further chapters consider semantic gesture in the dialogue with the studies of Paul Ricoeur regarding the relation between structuralism and hermeneutics (or analysis and interpretation), and in the context of Umberto Eco´s interpretation theory. The problems of interpretation represent the scope of our consideration { [...] } semantic gesture is understood not only as a theoretical term, but primarily as the concept that could lead us to deeper inquiring about the sense of particular literary works of art. Thus the work is devoted also to theoretical issues of interpretation of literary texts and the possibilities of application of the concept of semantic gesture in the interpretations of particular texts. Specific attempts to elaborate and apply the semantic gesture are reflected, especially the work of Milan Jankovič.

40|$|The paper reviews {{some recent}} {{numerical}} <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> the <b>interpretation</b> and exploitation of acoustic emission (AE) monitoring results obtained from historical masonry structures and materials. Among possible numerical techniques, the {{finite element method}} and the distinct method are considered. The analyzed numerical models cover the entire scale range, from microstructure and meso-structure, up to full-size real structures. The micro-modeling includes heterogeneous concrete-like materials, but mainly focuses on the masonry texture meso-structure, where each brick and mortar joint is modeled singularly. The full-size models consider the different typology of historical structures such as masonry towers, cathedrals and chapels. The main difficulties and advantages of the different numerical approaches, depending on the problem typology and scale, are critically analyzed. The main insight we can achieve from micro and meso numerical modeling concerns the scaling of AE as a function of volume and time, since it is also able to simulate the b-value temporal evolution as the damage spread into the structure. The finite element modeling of the whole structure provides useful hints for the optimal placement of the AE sensors, while the combination of AE monitoring results is crucial for a reliable assessment of structural safety...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{calculate}} the hydrodynamic ejection force {{acting on a}} microscopic emulsion drop, which is continuously growing at a capillary tip. This force could cause drop detachment in the processes of membrane and microchannel emulsification, and affect {{the size of the}} released drops. The micrometer-sized drops are not deformed by gravity and their formation happens at small Reynolds numbers {{despite the fact that the}} typical period of drop generation is of the order of 0. 1 s. Under such conditions, the flow of the disperse phase through the capillary, as it inflates the droplet, engenders a hydrodynamic force, which has a predominantly viscous (rather than inertial) origin. The hydrodynamic boundary problem is solved numerically, by using appropriate curvilinear coordinates. The spatial distributions of the stream function and the velocity components are computed. The hydrodynamic force acting on the drop is expressed in terms of three universal functions of the ratio of the pore and drop radii. These functions are computed numerically. Interpolation formulas are obtained for their easier calculation. It turns out that the increase in the viscosity of each of the two liquid phases increases the total ejection force. The results could find <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> the <b>interpretation</b> and prediction of the effect of hydrodynamic factors on the drop size in membrane emulsification. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{philosophical}} stance, terminology, methodology, and research findings of two representative and influential investigators in the field of nonverbal behavior, Ray L. Birdwhistell and Paul Ekman, drawing theoretical implications and practical <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> oral <b>interpretation.</b> The study found that while Birdwhistell has maintained that all nonverbal behavior is culturally learned and must be examined within the communication gestalt, Ekman has emphasized the innate, universal, and expressive elements of bodily movement, especially that of the face. Ekman has recognized the role of cultural learning, however. It was found that neither Birdwhistell's nor Ekman's research has rendered support for any of the theoretical approaches to nonverbal behavior which oral interpreters have entertained in the past. However, it was found that Birdwhistell's and Ekman's approaches to nonverbal behavior do justify a more deliberate training strategy in oral interpretation. It was found that Ekman's external variable research methodology which encompasses both indicative and communicative methods offers more chance of generating meaningful and useful research in oral interpretation than does Birdwhistell's structural approach. It was also found that Ekman's constructs of emblem, illustrator, regulator, adaptor, and affect display offer the most workable vocabulary with which to discuss and elucidate nonverbal behavior, and that Ekman's research which is continually updating and expanding these categories illuminates concepts with which oral interpretation scholars have been grappling for years...|$|R

In particular in systems biology, complex molecular systems are analyzed {{that require the}} generation and interpretation of heterogeneous data for their explanation, for example ranging from gene expression studies and mass spectrometry measurements to experimental techniques for detecting molecular interactions and functional assays. XML {{has become the most}} prominent format for representing and exchanging these data. However, besides the development of standards there is still a fundamental lack of data integration systems that are able to utilize these exchange formats, organize the data in an integrative way and link it with <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> data <b>interpretation</b> and analysis. Results We have developed DIPSBC, an interactive data integration platform supporting collaborative research projects, based on Foswiki, Solr/Lucene, and specific helper applications.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Featuring high waterfalls and forested cliffs, and {{displaying}} a remarkable transition between the Pacific and Interior west, the Columbia River Gorge reveals {{the grandeur of}} western landscapes. Yet the landscape that one sees today is an amalgamation of the Gorge's natural setting and its unique human history. Historical research on the Gorge is deficient, as few studies have addressed landscape change that occurred prior to the twentieth century. This research explores a significant yet underrepresented chapter in the Gorge's history, focusing on {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century. Specifically, this research examines changes in the land that resulted from building transportation infrastructure during this era, namely the development of portage, wagon, and military roads and in-stream navigational aids. Utilizing methods drawn from historical geography, this research employs a wide range of primary source materials, including journals, photographs, surveys, and construction records, to assess landscape change. Results from this study indicate a high spatial extent of landscape impacts resulting from transportation infrastructure put in place between 1850 and 1900. The clearing of floodplain forests, coupled with changes in the hydrography of the river channel brought about by the construction of the Cascade canal and lock, led to significant changes in ecological functions, including nutrient cycling and sediment retention. These results provide suggestions for restoration efforts in the Gorge and also hold important <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> historical <b>interpretation</b> in the contemporary National Scenic Area. There are also broad implications for researchers seeking a broader understanding of changes in western riparian landscapes during this period...|$|R
