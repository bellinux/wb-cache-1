500|$|In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} first {{wildlife}} refuge in the United States, Pelican Island. [...] Its first warden, Paul Kroegel, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida. [...] By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states. [...] Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: [...] "The natives <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who {{are not to be}} trifled with. [...] The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{gentrification}} of once rundown inner-city areas, {{coupled with}} the staging of pride parades in these areas, {{has resulted in the}} increased visibility of gay communities. Parades such as Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Manchester's Pride events attract significant investment and create tourist revenue, and cities <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize,</b> firstly, that the acceptance of lesbian and gay culture is fast becoming a sign of urban [...] "sophistication", and secondly, that gay-oriented events, such as pride parades, the World Outgames and the Gay Games, are potentially lucrative events, attracting thousands of gay tourists and their dollars. The growing recognition of the economic value of the gay community is not only associated with their wealth but also with the role that lesbians and gay men have played (and continue to play) in urban revitalization.|$|E

60|$|Faith {{felt she}} would rather submit then ask Jem Blythe about such a matter. She <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that her offence was a quite shameful one.|$|R
6000|$|... "With you?" [...] echoed Betty {{in a low}} tone. She <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that she}} had not known this man. She looked up at him. His eyes were misty with an unutterable sadness.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{rather a}} crude {{way of putting}} it," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Pomfret, with her glasses raised judicially. [...] "Women in what you call I society are, I am glad to say, taking an increasing interest in politics. They <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that it is a}} duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a seat {{which we}} Radicals {{had a right}} to," [...] Brooks declared. [...] "Now that the storm of Imperialism is quieting down and people <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that matters nearer home need a little attention, I cannot see how the {{manufacturing}} centres can do anything save return Radicals. We are the only party with a definite home policy." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Altrurian murmured: [...] "Awful! Shocking!" [...] But I thought {{somehow he}} had not really {{followed}} me very attentively in my celebration of our national violation {{of the laws of}} life and its consequences. [...] "I am glad," [...] he went on, [...] "that your business men and professional men <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the folly and wickedness of overwork. Shall I find some of your other weary workers here, too?" ...|$|E

60|$|Davenant, whose hair Mademoiselle Rosine {{had been}} ruffling, whose tie {{was no longer}} immaculate, and who <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that he had drunk {{a good deal of}} wine, leaned forward and {{regarded}} Macheson with admiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange. I {{know your}} home town quite well. But I {{have not yet}} made my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall. I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that I <b>am</b> one of the failures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hear {{so little}} of America over here. It's quite a large country {{and all sorts of}} {{interesting}} things happen there nowadays. And we are waking up to history. Quite fast. We shan't always be the most ignorant people in the world. We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that quite a lot of things happened between Adam and the Mayflower {{that we ought to be}} told about. I allow it's a recent revival. The United States has been like one of those men you read about in the papers who go away from home and turn up in some distant place with their memories gone. They've forgotten what their names were or where they lived or what they did for a living; they've forgotten everything that matters. Often they have to begin again and settle down for a long time before their memories come back. That's how it has been with us. Our memory is just coming back to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{remains to}} be said in this {{connection}} that workmen are already [...] discerning the practical and real causes at work affecting their [...] wages—affecting them more directly than any tariff system possibly [...] could—by showing no small alarm at the immigration of foreigners, [...] such as the Hungarian miners and Italian laborers, who willingly [...] underbid them. In other words, they <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize,</b> in a [...] practical way, the truth that increasing numbers are far more [...] potent {{than anything else in}} reducing wages. So long as [...] immigration is free to any race or nationality, there is no such [...] thing as “protection to home laborers”; the only protection to [...] them—not that I am urging the desirability of such measures—can [...] come solely from forces which limit the number of workmen who [...] enter into competition with them. Any other protection to [...] laboring-men than the prohibition of immigration—which no one [...] thinks of (except for the Chinese)—is an economic delusion. [...] Instead of “protecting” them to the extent of affording higher [...] wages, the tariff increases the cost of woolen clothing and other [...] articles of their consumption, in addition to forcing capital into [...] employments which yield a less return, and so insure lower wages.|$|E
6000|$|... "But surely," [...] she said, [...] "we {{ought not}} to be punished for our mistakes! I cannot believe that Christ himself {{intended}} that his religion should be so inelastic, so hard and fast, so cruel as you imply. Surely there is enough unhappiness without making more. You speak of incompatibility--but is it in all cases such an insignificant matter? We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> in these days something of the effects of character on character,--deteriorating effects, in many instances. With certain persons we are lifted up, inspired to face the battle of life and overcome its difficulties. I have known fine men and women whose lives have been stultified or ruined because they were badly mated. And I cannot see that the character of my own daughter has deteriorated because she has got a divorce from a man with whom she was profoundly out of sympathy--of harmony. On the contrary, she seems more of a person than she was; she has clearer, saner views of life; she has made her mistake and profited by it. Her views changed--Victor Warren's did not. She began to realize that some other woman might have an influence over his life--she had none, simply because he did not love her. And love is not a thing we can compel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> how {{you must}} feel," [...] she confessed. [...] "We won't {{talk about it}} any more now. Drive me to the theater, will you? I {{want to be there}} early to-night, just to get {{everything}} ready for changing afterward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless {{in spite}} of the Church, marvellously through the Church the germ of our Lord's message has come down to us, and the age in which we live <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> its purport, <b>to</b> condemn the Church for her subservient rationalism.|$|R
6000|$|Morton, hearing this, {{inwardly}} commented; [...] "These obscure {{forms of}} hysteria often possess the cunning, the dissimulation of madness. Poor girl! She <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> her predicament, and is preparing us for disappointment," [...] {{and a return}} of his doubt kept him silent.|$|R
60|$|The {{scheme and}} scale upon which this History is planned {{do not permit}} us {{to enter into the}} {{complicated}} and acrimonious disputes that centre about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which concluded the Great War. We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that that conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing, began nothing and settled nothing. It killed millions of people; it wasted and impoverished the world. It smashed Russia altogether. It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and confusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe. The crudely organized egotisms and passions of national and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it sufficiently unimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered from its war exhaustion and fatigue. Wars and revolutions make nothing; their utmost service to mankind is that, in a very rough and painful way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things. The great war lifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered the imperialism of Russia. It cleared away a number of monarchies. But a multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still exasperate, great armies accumulate fresh stores of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... "Through {{discussions on}} gender equality, the ILO noted that {{problems}} had deepened {{for the most}} vulnerable, including women in domestic work. Yet while the global economic downturn has contributed to aggravating their vulnerabilities, domestic workers <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> gains through changes in public attitude." ...|$|E
5000|$|With the {{significant}} {{shift in the}} way firms are motivating their employees in recent years, many companies <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that having a “strong corporate culture” is an important ingredient in organizational success. Employee commitment is “replacing traditional controls such as direct supervision and bureaucratic arrangements.” [...] No longer do these high commitment workplaces rely on their CEOs to force the workers to produce, but instead, these workers are self-motivated to bring their best to the company.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were very}} frank with me once, Wingrave," [...] she said. [...] "You are {{a man whose}} life fate has wrecked, fate and I! You have no heart left, no feeling. You can create {{suffering}} and find it amusing. I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Michael said he {{had hidden}} the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. In 2009 Michael said: [...] "My {{depression}} {{at the end of}} Wham! was because I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> I <b>was</b> gay, not bisexual." ...|$|R

5000|$|DiLaurentis was {{the former}} [...] "Queen Bee" [...] of her clique {{and the most}} popular girl in school before her disappearance. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their strongest secrets against them to keep them together. Charming and manipulative, DiLaurentis was skilled at finding ways {{to get back at}} everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> they {{actually}} knew nothing deep about her.|$|E
50|$|Crowd {{computing}} {{offers a}} harmonious amalgamation of both cloud computing and crowdsourcing. It combines human intelligence (the crowd) with artificial intelligence (the cloud) {{in order to}} produce quality results at unprecedented speed. Scientists and historians are already utilizing this process to complete time-consuming research, and many businesses <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> its potential for cutting costs and increasing productivity. Crowd computing very well may be on its way to changing the way humans live and operate in our society by using artificial intelligence in combination with the human mind.|$|E
5000|$|The {{photographer}} Margaret Watkins visited Annie and Farquhar McGillivray Knowles in New York in 1923. She wrote they, [...] "are both awfully orthodox {{in their}} work and made a great to-do about the modern movement in art ... My prints are a darned sight more up and coming than his silly little paintings of boats and pink apple trees. They <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that their attitude is a bit behind the times and instead of catching up with the procession they wax sarcastic and grouch on the side." ...|$|E
60|$|Taught by gatlings and injunctions, {{which have}} smashed many an {{otherwise}} successful strike, the labor group <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that it all}} depends upon who is behind and who is before the gatlings and the injunctions. And he who knows the labor movement knows that there is slowly growing up and being formulated a clear and definite policy for the capture {{of the political and}} judicial machinery.|$|R
50|$|At that time, Canada <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{problems}} associated with its large land mass and attempting to discern the availability of natural resources. The federal government decided to launch a national program to assist in management and inventory of its resources.

5000|$|The company's success so far {{in terms}} of funding and {{industry}} recognition reflects a number of developing trends - the growth of e-commerce, the drive to use machine learning to solve problems for which big data is available, and online retailers' growing concern about the impact fraud prevention has on their customers. As Gartner {{pointed out in the}} April 2016 report, How Card Acceptors Can Protect Against the New Wave of Card Fraud, [...] "Web commerce has shifted the role of fraud detection from the arcane back office loss prevention department to being front and center in the customer experience."
