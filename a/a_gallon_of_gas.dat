Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at {{the time of}} the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.|$|E

50|$|Finally, in 2013, the General Assembly {{passed a}} new massive {{transportation}} funding package, sponsored by Speaker of the House of Delegates William J. Howell that accomplished {{the same as}} the HRTA authorizing legislation, with the exception of granting the new authority taxation power. Instead, the General Assembly itself levied the tax increases—a statewide sales and use tax increase to 4.8%, a statewide increase in motor vehicle registration fees by $15, as well as, {{for the first time since}} 1986, a change in the statewide gas tax to be 3.5% of the price of <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> instead of a flat 17.5 cents per gallon.

5000|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is seen two ways. The first {{view is that}} more work is done from {{the same amount of}} energy used. The other perception is that the same amount of work is accomplished with less energy used in the system. Some ways to get more work out of less energy is to [...] "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" [...] the materials used in daily life. The advancement of technology has led to other uses of waste. Technology such as waste-to-energy facilities which convert solid wastes through the process of gasification or pyrolysis to liquid fuels to be burned. The Environmental Protection Agency stated that the United States produced 250 million tons of municipal waste in 2010. Of that 250 million tons roughly 54% gets thrown in land fills, 33% is recycled, and 13% goes to energy recovery plants. In European countries who pay more for fuel, such as Denmark where the price for <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> neared $10 in 2010, have more fully developed waste-to energy facilities. In 2010 Denmark sent 7% of waste to landfills, 69% was recycled, and 24% was sent to waste-to-energy facilities. There are several other developed Western European countries that also have taken energy engineering into consideration. Germany's [...] "Energiewende", a policy which set the goal by 2050 to meet 80% of electrical needs from renewable energy sources.|$|E
5000|$|The Super Duty was {{introduced}} in 1958, {{the same year as}} the FE and MEL series V8 engines, as a replacement for the Lincoln Y-block in truck applications. The Super Duty was available in displacements of 401, 477 and 534 cubic inches (6.6L, 7.8L and 8.8L). These engines were large, heavy, high torque engines and operated at a relatively low RPM. They were never designed as automobile engines and were commonly found in large, industrial use vehicles including dump trucks, garbage trucks, concrete mixing trucks, large buses and other medium and heavy duty trucks of the time. The Super Duty engine was built in Ford's Cleveland engine plant number 2. They had a unique intake system where the intake dumped into the head and all four cylinders pulled the mixture out of a log type port in the head. They could spit when cold and blow the choke plate out into the air cleaner because of the large port configuration. In later engines this was corrected; they had a spider type intake more modern style. The exhaust valves were sodium filled that when hot it liquefied and carried heat away from the valve head and took it to the valve spring that dispensed heat into the oil coming off the rocker arm which is the reason for a water to oil cooler. The piston assembly weighed three times more than other gas engine manufactures. The block was unique in that it was a 90 degree v 8 but the top deck was 60 degrees. The head was flat on the combustion chamber side so by doing this they achieved a wedge combustion chamber. With this design it left a big hole so they put a large pop top piston to try to displace some volume. They used a deep skirted block for strength. They governed these at about 3400 rpm due to their great rotating mass. When ford built the 385 series engine and started to change over a 460 or 429 weighed about half of the 477. The 401,477,534 engines also had 4 radiator hoses, when you ordered they would ask if you needed the( [...] lower lower,upper lower,lower upper or the upper upper which was amusing to do to new parts guys.

40|$|This story {{becomes more}} complex when an {{environmental}} lens {{is used to}} look at the costs of energy. Waste removal, restoration of the earth and the effects of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are all externalized from economic calculations. These costs are usually shifted, by govern-ment regulations, away from privately held corporations and assigned directly or indi-rectly to tax-payers. When one trains the even wider lens of human health on the issue of energy, the story becomes even murkier. Where are the costs of environmen-tally-caused diseases calculated in our sys-tem? Who pays for neurotoxic damage caused by mercury deposited in our food chain by coal-burning power plants? The price of a barrel of oil certainly doesn’t carry this burden, nor does <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> nor our electrical bill. In a very real sense, our healthcare system is part of the externalized cost of our energy consumption. When natural resources are auctioned off at discount rates and foreign oil is kept artificially cheap through military industrial strategies, little economic stabili-ty in human or ecological terms results. Indigenous populations are often left to suffer negative health consequences from sloppy industrial development. The poverty and ecological damage found in Nigeria, an oil rich country, {{is an example of how}} little true economic stability is gained from fossil fuel extraction in third world countries. The trauma of Chernobyl offers another potent example. Other externalized costs of our energy use include loss of biological diversity, loss of ecosystem integrity, loss of atmospheric and climate regulation, and loss of the energy that comes from sunlight converted into usable energy by forests and agricul-tural practices. The intrinsic functions nature performs are often incalculable i...|$|E
