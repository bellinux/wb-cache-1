40|$|Many active {{noise control}} (ANC) systems apply the filtered-x least mean squares (FXLMS) {{algorithm}} for controller adaptation. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> models {{is an important issue}} in these systems. Since parameter drifting in a noise field may cause model error between the secondary path and its prestored model in an ANC system, some ANC systems employ two adaptive processes for path modeling and controller adaptation respectively. In this paper, a new ANC system is proposed with adaptive path modeling and nonadaptive controller design. The proposed ANC system is noninvasive without persistent excitations. It avoids the slow convergence and inevitable estimation errors in controller adaptation. A rigorous analysis is presented to prove that the new ANC system will converge to an optimal one in the minimum H 2 norm sense. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed ANC system. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

The contribution of received signal strength by transmission and reflection will be greatly reduced, {{and most of}} the time, the radio waves will reach the user by bypass diffraction. Therefore, the traditional path loss model is no longer applicable, and the improved model should be proposed. In this paper, we firstly proposed an indoor radio propagation model based on dominant path in which the received signal strength {{has nothing to do with}} the direct distance between user and access point, but is related to the length <b>of</b> dominant <b>path.</b> Then on the basis <b>of</b> dominant <b>path</b> model, the NLOS influence is considered in order to further improve the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> dominant <b>path</b> model.

Our analysis is performed using a large corpus of measurements collected on production networks operating in the 2. 4 [*]GHz ISM, 5. 8 [*]GHz UNII, and 900 [*]MHz ISM bands in a diverse set of rural and urban environments. We find that the landscape of path loss models is precarious: typical best-case performance accuracy of these models is {{on the order of}} 12 – 15 [*]dB root mean square error (RMSE) and in practice it can be much worse. Models that can be tuned with measurements and explicit data fitting approaches enable a reduction in RMSE to 8 - 9 [*]dB. These bounds on modeling error appear to be relatively constant, even in differing environments and at differing frequencies.

40|$|A cross-well, shear-wave {{data set}} posed two problems: 1) wells are {{separated}} by only 12. 5 wavelengths, so thin raypaths are a poor approximation; 2) data are recorded through a high-velocity limestone surrounded by low-velocity shales. Waves are bent considerably, so either refracted or direct arrivals can arrive first. Only first-arrivals can be picked with any reliability. Ray tracing is avoided entirely by extrapolating traveltimes explicitly from sources or receivers to every point in a region of interest. Rather than search for a single fastest raypath, this method finds Fresnel regions containing all paths that add con-structively to first-arrivals. This method also robustly finds minimum traveltimes, whether direct or refracted. The resolution of the estimated velocity model is controlled explicitly with basis functions of adjustablewidth. Wavepaths and velocities are estimated alternately: as the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>paths</b> improves, velocities are allowed to introduce sharper detail.

40|$|One of {{the oldest}} beliefs about human {{wayfinding}} is {{that some people have}} a natural ability that distinguishes them from others. In four experiments, we asked adults to rate their own sense of direction, a promising index of orientation skills despite its simplicity and reliance on self-assessment. There were small to moderate correlations between self-ratings and accuracy of pointing to imagined landmarks, <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> choices during a route reversal and detour, speed at executing shortcuts, and accuracy of choices of halls within a building complex. Although we did not find consistent gender differences in actual wayfinding, effects across experiments indicate that females rated their sense of direction as worse thanmales. Deliberations by femalesmay have affected the speed of some of their performances. The results suggest that self-evaluation of sense of direction is associated with evaluation of one’s familiarity with features of particular environments, as well as memories of successes and failures in recent wayfinding efforts.

In this paper, we present a study on pedestrian path prediction and action classification at short subsecond time intervals.

40|$|In {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} localization, path loss model {{is often used to}} provide a conversion between distance and received signal strength (RSS). Path loss exponent {{is one of the main}} environmental parameters for path loss model to characterize the rate of conversion. Therefore, the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> loss exponent directly influences the results of RSS-to-distance conversion. When the conversion requires distance estimation from RSS value, small error of measured path loss exponent could lead to large error of the conversion output. To improve the localization results, the approaches of measuring accurate parameters from different environments have become important. Different approaches provide different measurement stabilities, depending on the performance and robustness of the approach. This paper presents four calibration approaches to provide measurements of path loss exponent based on measurement arrangement and transmitter/receiver node’s allocation. These include one-line measurement, online-update spread locations measurement, online-update small-to big rectangular measurement, and online-update big-to-small rectangular measurement. The first two are general approaches, and the last two are our newly proposed approaches. Based on our research experiments, a comparison is presented among the four approaches in terms of accuracy and stability. The results show that both online-update rectangular measurements have better stability of measurements. For accuracy of measurement, online-update big-to-small rectangular measurement provides the best result after convergence...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} random nonlinear vibration of {{a spur gear}} pair subjected to both deterministic and random loads by path integration method. Different models and approaches to apply the path integration method are presented in Chapters 2 – 4. Backlash nonlinearity and time-varying mesh stiffness in gear systems are both considered in Chapters 2 and 3. In Chapter 2, the time-varying mesh stiffness is modeled as a constant plus a cosinusoidal component, and the discontinuous backlash nonlinearity is approximated with a cubic polynomial through curve fitting. Then Gaussian closure procedure is employed to obtain the mean and variance of transition probability density function (PDF). In Chapter 3, the time-varying mesh stiffness is approximated with a square wave function. The variance of the responses is calculated and expressed as closed forms for two different cases in gear systems. In Chapter 4, the gear rattling model which only considers backlash is presented. A degenerate Gaussian distribution is employed as transition PDF. The path integration results are compared with deterministic results (Chapters 2 and 3) and Monte Carlo simulation results (Chapters 3 and 4). Good agreement is found between them, which could verify the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> integration method {{in the study of}} random gear dynamics...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that path-integrated attenuation (PIA) {{can be used to}} improve precipitation estimates from high-frequency weather radar data. One approach that provides an estimate of this quantity from airborne or spaceborne radar data is the surface reference technique (SRT), which uses measurements of the surface cross section in the presence and absence of precipitation. Measurements from the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite afford the first opportunity to test the method for spaceborne radar data at Ka band {{as well as for the}} Ku-band-Ka-band combination. The study begins by reviewing the basis of the single- and dual-frequency SRT. As the performance of the method is closely tied to the behavior of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS or sigma(0)) of the surface, the statistics of sigma(0) derived from DPR measurements are given as a function of incidence angle and frequency for ocean and land backgrounds over a 1 -month period. Several independent estimates of the PIA, formed by means of different surface reference datasets, can be used to test the consistency of the method since, in the absence of error, the estimates should be identical. Along with theoretical considerations, the comparisons provide an initial assessment of the performance of the single- and dual-frequency SRT for the DPR. The study finds that the dual-frequency SRT can provide improvement in the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> attenuation estimates relative to the single-frequency method, particularly at Ku band...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} requirements for successful navigation through an environment is the continuous monitoring of distance travelled. To do so, humans normally use one {{or a combination of}} visual, proprioceptive/efferent, vestibular, and temporal cues. In the real world, information from one sensory modality is normally congruent with information from other modalities; hence, studying the nature of sensory interactions is often difficult. In order to decouple the natural covariation between different sensory cues, we used virtual reality technology to vary the relation between the information generated from visual sources and the information generated from proprioceptive/efferent sources. When we manipulated the stimuli such that the visual information was coupled in various ways to the proprioceptive/efferent information, human subjects predominantly used visual information to estimate the ratio <b>of</b> two traversed <b>path</b> lengths. Although proprioceptive/efferent information was not used directly, the mere availability of proprioceptive information increased the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>path</b> length estimation based on visual cues, even though the proprioceptive/efferent information was inconsistent with the visual information.
