5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E

Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind.

500|$|In a late 1989 {{interview}} with John Robb in Sounds, Cobain {{noted that the}} band's music was changing. He said, [...] "The early songs were really angry... But {{as time goes on}} the songs are getting poppier and poppier <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> happier and happier. The songs are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human beings". In April 1990, the band began working with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin on recordings for the follow-up to Bleach. During the sessions, Cobain and Novoselic became disenchanted with Channing's drumming, and Channing expressed frustration at not being actively involved in songwriting. As bootlegs of Nirvana's demos with Vig began to circulate in the music industry and draw attention from major labels, Channing left the band. That July, the band recorded the single [...] "Sliver" [...] with Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Nirvana asked Dale Crover to fill in on drums for a seven-date American West Coast tour with Sonic Youth that August.|$|E
500|$|When Stickells {{expressed}} concern that the arrest might jeopardize the concert that was scheduled for that night at Maple Leaf Gardens, the booking detective assured them that he would [...] "get it done as quickly" [...] as he could because his children had tickets for the event; he commented: [...] "they'll kill me if I don't get [...] out." [...] Management at the Gardens pressured the Toronto police department to release him, complaining that the sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans might riot if they canceled the show. He was released by 8 p.m. and escorted to the venue by the police, who remained at the arena throughout the performance. He displayed a jovial attitude during the concert, joking with the audience and singing in a mock operatic style for comedic effect. In light of the arrest, he altered the lyrics to [...] "Red House", singing [...] "soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of jail, I wanna see her." ...|$|E

500|$|While still {{performing}} as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached both Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette {{of her own}} songs on which she had been working. These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut, including [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E

[...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory.

500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care if I get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it a lot easier for me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E

500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E
2500|$|Such moves irritated Stanton, who said, [...] "I {{get more}} radical <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> older, while {{she seems to}} grow more conservative." [...] In 1895 Stanton {{published}} The Woman's Bible, which attacked {{the use of the}} Bible to relegate women to an inferior status. It became a highly controversial best-seller.

2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E

You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you.
