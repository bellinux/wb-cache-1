5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard <b>amino</b> acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} <b>amino</b> acids from the diet. The <b>amino</b> acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential <b>amino</b> acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain <b>amino</b> acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If <b>amino</b> acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the <b>amino</b> acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common <b>amino</b> acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential <b>amino</b> acids, so nine essential <b>amino</b> acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all <b>amino</b> acid synthesis and take their <b>amino</b> acids directly from their hosts. All <b>amino</b> acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. <b>Amino</b> acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an <b>amino</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the <b>amino</b> acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total <b>amino</b> acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential <b>amino</b> acids. Analysis of the free <b>amino</b> acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal <b>amino</b> acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the <b>amino</b> group by a transaminase. The <b>amino</b> group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic <b>amino</b> acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of <b>amino</b> acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, <b>amino</b> acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from <b>amino</b> acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the <b>amino</b> acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each <b>amino</b> acid. The key elements of an <b>amino</b> acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain <b>amino</b> acids. About 500 <b>amino</b> acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) <b>amino</b> acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, <b>amino</b> acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, <b>amino</b> acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each <b>amino</b> acid within the chain attached to two neighboring <b>amino</b> acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of <b>amino</b> acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the <b>amino</b> acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an <b>amino</b> acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard <b>amino</b> acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via <b>amino</b> acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an <b>amino</b> acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its <b>amino</b> group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the <b>amino</b> group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, <b>amino</b> acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more <b>amino</b> groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new <b>amino</b> acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer <b>amino</b> acids that later evolved to code a larger set of <b>amino</b> acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. <b>Amino</b> acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|An <b>amino</b> acid is also {{amphoteric}} {{with the}} added complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic <b>amino</b> group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of <b>amino</b> acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one <b>amino</b> acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of <b>amino</b> acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the <b>amino</b> acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the <b>amino</b> group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} 22 proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids, many non-proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids are known. Those either are {{not found in}} {{proteins}} (for example carnitine, GABA, Levothyroxine) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, hydroxyproline and selenomethionine).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{principles}} govern specific RNA {{interaction with}} <b>amino</b> acids. Experiments with aptamers showed that some <b>amino</b> acids have a selective chemical affinity for their codons. Experiments showed that of 8 <b>amino</b> acids tested, 6 show some RNA triplet-amino acid association.|$|E
5|$|Convergence {{occurs at}} the level of DNA and <b>amino</b> acids. In 2013 the first {{genome-wide}} study of convergence was published. Comparisons of the genomes of echolocating bats and the dolphin identified numerous convergent <b>amino</b> acid substitutions in genes implicated in hearing and vision.|$|E
5|$|Differences in the SFTPA1 gene {{sequence}} at {{the coding}} region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been identified}} and characterized for SFTPA1 (and SFTPA2) in the population. SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of <b>amino</b> acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (<b>amino</b> acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in <b>amino</b> acid substitutions (<b>amino</b> acid 19, 50, 133, and 219). Four SP-A1 variants (6A, 6A2, 6A3, 6A4) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 6A2.|$|E
5|$|Differences in the SFTPA2 gene {{sequence}} at {{the coding}} region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been identified}} and characterized for SFTPA2 (and SFTPA1) in the population. SFTPA2 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of <b>amino</b> acids 9, 91, 140, and 223. Three of these do not modify the SP-A2 protein sequence (<b>amino</b> acids 9, 91, and 223), whereas the remaining one results in an <b>amino</b> acid substitution (<b>amino</b> acid 140). Six SP-A2 variants (1A, 1A0, 1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1A5) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 1A0.|$|E
5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some <b>amino</b> acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 <b>amino</b> acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to <b>amino</b> acid coding patterns.|$|E
5|$|In <b>amino</b> acids {{that have}} a carbon chain {{attached}} to the α–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on. In some <b>amino</b> acids, the amine group {{is attached to the}} β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma <b>amino</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{at least}} three {{transcript}} variants are known for EFS: isoform 1, containing 6 exons end encoding the full-length protein with 561 <b>amino</b> acids; isoform 2, containing 5 exons and encoding a shorter protein (468 <b>amino</b> acids in length); and isoform 3, containing 6 exons and encoding the shortest protein (392 <b>amino</b> acids).|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other <b>amino</b> acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the <b>amino</b> group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for <b>amino</b> acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{and plants}} can {{synthesize}} many uncommon <b>amino</b> acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine, {{which is a}} sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these <b>amino</b> acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin. However, in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic <b>amino</b> acid that is a key intermediate {{in the production of}} the plant hormone ethylene.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the <b>amino</b> acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same <b>amino</b> acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to <b>amino</b> acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new <b>amino</b> acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E
5|$|Most often, H-phosphonate {{building}} blocks are protected at the 5'-hydroxy group {{and at the}} <b>amino</b> group of nucleic bases A, C, and G {{in the same manner}} as phosphoramidite {{building blocks}} (see below). However, protection at the <b>amino</b> group is not mandatory.|$|E
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an <b>amino</b> group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard <b>amino</b> acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard <b>amino</b> acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the <b>amino</b> acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|Nonstandard <b>amino</b> acids {{are usually}} formed through {{modifications}} to standard <b>amino</b> acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} <b>amino</b> acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the <b>amino</b> acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker <b>amino</b> acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted <b>amino</b> acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted <b>amino</b> acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted <b>amino</b> acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Short <b>amino</b> acid {{sequences}} within proteins often act as recognition {{sites for}} other proteins. For instance, SH3 domains typically bind to short PxxP motifs (i.e. 2 prolines , separated by 2 unspecified <b>amino</b> acids , although the surrounding <b>amino</b> acids may determine the exact binding specificity). A {{large number of}} such motifs has been collected in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>amino</b> acids {{have special}} {{properties}} such as cysteine, that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine {{that is more}} flexible than other <b>amino</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids are {{not found}} in proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic <b>amino</b> acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard <b>amino</b> acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of <b>amino</b> acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|The 20 <b>amino</b> acids {{that are}} encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical <b>amino</b> acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial <b>amino</b> acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other <b>amino</b> acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard <b>amino</b> acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The <b>amino</b> acid {{differences}} that distinguish between SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 genes and between their corresponding variants are {{located at the}} collagen-like domain. The <b>amino</b> acid {{differences that}} distinguish among SFTPA2 variants are located both at the carbohydrate recognition and the collagen-like domains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>amino</b> {{acids in}} a {{polypeptide}} chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual <b>amino</b> acid {{is called a}} residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized in{{directly from the}} essential <b>amino</b> acid phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential <b>amino</b> acid tyrosine. These <b>amino</b> acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} <b>amino</b> acids were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first <b>amino</b> acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common <b>amino</b> acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential <b>amino</b> acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all <b>amino</b> acids for optimal growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} {{side chains}} of <b>amino</b> acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions {{are determined by}} the groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of <b>amino</b> acid.|$|E
