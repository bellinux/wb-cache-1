5|$|<b>Ala</b> can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition {{has it that}} an <b>ala</b> sneaked into St. Simeon, which made him voracious, but St. Sava took her out of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an <b>ala</b> who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the <b>ala</b> destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an <b>ala</b> gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E
5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the <b>ala</b> with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the <b>ala</b> with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the <b>ala</b> punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an <b>ala</b> for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an <b>ala</b> is the godmother visits the <b>ala</b> with her mother, the <b>ala</b> eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an <b>ala</b> were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An <b>ala</b> may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the <b>ala,</b> {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an <b>ala</b> blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an <b>ala</b> and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E

The <b>Alas</b> language also uses many similar vocabulary with Karo language of the Karo people in North Sumatra. It is estimated that 80,000 people spoke the language in 2000. It is thought that the <b>Alas</b> language might have originated from Batak languages, however the <b>Alas</b> community refuses to be labelled as [...] "Batak" [...] on the basis of different religious practices. Besides, it is not clearly known if the language is a separate language on its own. Although <b>Alas</b> people live in Aceh Province, the language they use is very different with Acehnese language.|$|R
5|$|NOTE: Opinion {{is divided}} {{about the size}} of an <b>ala</b> turma, between 30 and 32 men. 30 {{was the size of a}} turma in the Republican cavalry and in the cohors equitata of the Principate auxilia. Against this is a {{statement}} by Arrian that an <b>ala</b> was 512 strong. This would make an <b>ala</b> turma 32 men strong.|$|E
5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the <b>ala</b> is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has it that a man kept such an <b>ala</b> in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E

5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an <b>ala</b> leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the <b>ala,</b> just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted <b>ala</b> {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the <b>ala</b> was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} <b>ala</b> is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an <b>ala</b> threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an <b>ala</b> with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an <b>ala</b> finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|Comparing folk tales, {{there are}} {{similarities}} between the <b>ala</b> and the Russian Baba Yaga. The aforementioned motif of a stepdaughter coming to an ala’s house in a forest is recorded among Russians too– there a stepdaughter comes to Baba Yaga’s house and feeds her “livestock”. Similar are also the motifs of an <b>ala</b> (by Serbs) and Baba Yaga (by Russians) becoming godmothers to children whom they later eat because the children discover their secret. In the Serbian example, the mother of an ala’s godchild speaks with the <b>ala,</b> and in the Russian, the godchild speaks with Baba Yaga.|$|E

5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the <b>ala,</b> {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an <b>ala,</b> he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the <b>ala</b> with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of an <b>ala</b> is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore. A given <b>ala</b> {{may look like}} a black wind, a gigantic creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An <b>ala</b> may also assume various human or animal shapes, and can even possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described is due to the ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike <b>ala,</b> her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live in the clouds, or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or gigantic tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E

40|$|Thanks {{to their}} multi-valley, anisotropic, energy band structure, {{two-dimensional}} electron systems (2 DESs) in modulation-doped <b>AlAs</b> quantum wells (QWs) provide a unique platform to investigate electron interaction physics and ballistic transport.

5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an <b>ala</b> on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her.

5|$|An <b>ala</b> or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an <b>ala,</b> their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an <b>ala</b> is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
