5000|$|The five minute audio {{version of}} the on-the-hour {{newscast}} consists of two minutes of news, one minute of ads or Fox promotions, and two more minutes of news. In February 2017 the audio version eliminated the commercial/PSA break at the two-minute mark, so that the newscast ran only four minutes, but the commercial minute was restored in May 2017, returning it to a five-minute newscast. It is available as a podcast. [...] As of 2011, typically only one MP3 file, the most recent one, is available at any time. The Eastern Time hour number converted to 24-hour time is incorporated into the filename (for example, 5minpodcast21.mp3 for 9PM). However, {{if there has been}} exceptional news (<b>a</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>Alert),</b> the file for that hour's podcast will be retained for a few hours. The current hour's file is usually available within 10 minutes of its broadcast, i.e., by a quarter past the top of the hour.|$|E

40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

50|$|Channel 60 {{signed on}} in 1991 as WYVN, <b>a</b> <b>Fox</b> affiliate. <b>A</b> <b>news</b> {{department}} was quickly set up, and offered more news than other {{stations in the}} area. However, Flying A Communications, the owner, found itself in financial trouble, due to this local news commitment and relatively poor ratings (partially caused by its location on cable, which was higher than other stations), leading to the station shutting down two years later, in 1993, after a sale to Benchmark Communications (who would have converted the station to a CBS affiliate for Winchester, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland, under the WUSQ-TV callsign) fell through. A few months later, WYVN returned as an independent station, owned by Green River. The station tried to restore some local programming (including the newscast and a new talk show hosted by Gay Dawson), but further financial trouble caused this era to also end up being short-lived, abruptly ending in 1994.|$|R
