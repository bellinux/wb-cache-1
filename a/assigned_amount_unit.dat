50|$|Unchecked, {{energy use}} and hence {{emission}} levels are predicted to keep rising over time. Thus {{the number of}} companies needing to buy credits will increase, and the rules {{of supply and demand}} will push up the market price, encouraging more groups to undertake environmentally friendly activities that create carbon credits to sell. An individual allowance, such as an <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>unit</b> (AAU) or its near-equivalent European Union Allowance (EUA), may have a different market value to an offset such as a CER.

40|$|AbstractIn Estonia {{there is}} a total of {{approximately}} 27, 000 apartment buildings, and approximately 90 % of all apartment buildings were built before 1990. The majority of those buildings have same typical problems: high energy consumption levels, insufficient ventilation, uneven indoor temperatures, and insufficient thermal comfort levels. Therefore, a pretty extensive, or ‘deep’ level of renovation is required. Any large-scale and systematic renovation process for apartment buildings in Estonia is complicated {{due to the fact}} that a total of 82 % of dwellings are privately owned. Apartment buildings are generally managed by apartment associations which means that all of the apartment owners in each building must agree on the volume of any renovation work and also on the budget for such work. During the period between 2010 - 2014, a total of 663 apartment buildings have undergone renovation work in Estonia thanks to a support scheme that is joint-financed by <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Unit</b> trading and a government budget, administered by Fund KredEx. The total of investment in relation to apartment associations and the grant scheme amounted to 151 million euros, of which 38 million took the form of grants. Average energy savings per apartment building were 43 % and the total annual energy saving was approximately 60 GWh. The main lessons learned have been that preparation with an apartment association in regard to renovation work takes time - up to two years - and there is no direct way in which apartment associations can be guided when it comes to renovation work; this can only be managed through raising awareness and though good example. A total of 102 million euros of European Union Structural Funds will be used in a new grant scheme which started in 2015, to renovate existing apartment buildings in Estonia. This paper describes the new grant scheme and measures to avoid and overcome the main problems which occurred in previous grant schemes...|$|E

50|$|In September 2012 Thomson Reuters Point Carbon {{calculated}} that the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period had been oversupplied by about 13 billion tonnes (13.1 Gt) of CO2 and that the second commitment period (2013-2020) was likely {{to start with a}} surplus of <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Units</b> (AAUs).|$|R
40|$|Latvia has the {{unprecedented}} oppertunity {{to be the}} first country in the world to sell <b>assigned</b> <b>amounts</b> under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol- International Emission Trading.

2500|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'caps' or [...] for Greenhouse gases for the {{developed}} Annex 1 countries {{are known as}} <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amounts</b> and are listed in Annex B. The quantity of the initial <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> is denominated in individual <b>units,</b> called <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAUs), each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered into the country's national registry.|$|R
2500|$|So, specifically, for the 2008-2012 {{commitment}} period (CP1), New Zealand may either limit emissions to the <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> (five times the 1990 gross volume of emissions) or allow emissions to increase and add emission units from domestic afforestation {{or from the}} international carbon markets to the <b>assigned</b> <b>amount.</b> [...] The additional units may be any of the Kyoto units; <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAU), Removal Units (RMU), Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units.|$|R
5|$|During the {{transition}} phase (July 2010 to December 2012), only the forestry sector {{will be able}} to convert the NZUs allocated to them to <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> that can be sold to overseas buyers. However, temporary CERs and iCERS cannot be used in the NZ ETS, and neither can CERs and ERUs generated from nuclear projects.|$|R
2500|$|The Protocol defines three [...] "flexibility mechanisms" [...] {{that can}} be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their {{emission}} limitation commitments. [...] The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to [...] "trade" [...] their emissions (<b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Units,</b> AAUs, or [...] "allowances" [...] for short).|$|R
5000|$|The Kyoto Protocol also defined another carbon-pricing {{mechanism}} {{in the form}} of <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Units</b> (AAUs) which were allocated to match country's <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amounts</b> (for most countries, their 1990 emission levels minus their emission reduction commitments). It also specified rules for trading these [...] "carbon credits." [...] Trade of AAUs takes place between countries, and their price represents a carbon price faced by countries under the Protocol. However, since businesses cannot purchase AAUs, that price has generally not been passed through to emitters.|$|R
50|$|As {{noted in}} the {{previous}} paragraph, participants in the NZ ETS could also use most of the 'Kyoto Units' to meet their surrender obligations. The permitted <b>units</b> were: <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAUs), Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), Removal Units (RMUs), and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). However, temporary CERs and iCERS cannot be used, and neither can CERs and ERUs generated from nuclear projects. Consequently, compared to other emissions trading schemes, the NZ ETS is highly linked to the international markets {{and will be a}} price-taker.|$|R
50|$|The Climate Change Response Act 2002 {{created a}} legal {{framework}} for New Zealand {{to ratify the}} Kyoto Protocol and to meet obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It sets out powers for the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> and to trade Kyoto-compliant emission units (carbon credits) on the international market. It establishes a registry to record holdings and transfers of emission units. It establishes a national inventory agency to record and report greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
40|$|Latvia has an {{unprecedented}} {{opportunity to be}} first {{country in the world}} to sell <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol – International Emissions Trading. Negotiations are ongoing with a number of buyers for pilot transactions with a cumulative volume of 8 - 10 million <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAUs) out of 40 million AAUs earmarked by Latvia’s Government for total sales. Signed agreements are expected in 2009. Latvia’s Government has indicated their interest in exploring options to sell the full volume of available AAUs by the end of 2012. The main goal of these activities is ‘greening’ – increase the market value of Latvia’s AAUs and alleviate buyers concerns regarding the environmental integrity of transactions. The Government of Latvia has agreed to ‘green’ the transaction and channel the revenues to projects or programs with environmental benefits. The Ministry of Environment, representing the Government has indicated its interest to buyers in pursuing greening during the pilot transaction in the following areas: biomass and biogas heating, energy efficiency improvements in public sector buildings and residential buildings. Pilot transactions will be followed by other transactions for other renewable energy sources. All activities are covered by Latvia’s Climate Change Financial Instrument (CCFI). This article focuses solely on programs related to energy efficiency in buildings...|$|R
40|$|The sale of <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAUs) from {{countries}} whose emissions have declined since their baseline year under the Kyoto Protocol has led critics {{to be skeptical}} of carbon markets {{due to the lack}} of actual emission reductions that occur as a result of these trades. This policy review describes the historical context of AAU trading, current market price and volumes, and environmental and economic impacts of the current AAU trading rules. Options for how to handle current, and prevent the creation of future, surplus AAUs are discussed...|$|R
50|$|For {{emissions}} trading where greenhouse gases are regulated, one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one metric ton {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO2) emissions. Other names for emissions permits are carbon credits, Kyoto <b>units,</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units,</b> and Certified Emission Reduction units (CER). These permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price. These trade and settle internationally, and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries. Each international transfer is validated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Each transfer of ownership within the European Union is additionally validated by the European Commission.|$|R
50|$|The Te Apiti {{wind farm}} {{is also a}} carbon offset project. In 2005 the British bank HSBC {{purchased}} 125,000 tonnes worth of carbon credits from Meridian generated by the wind farm. Meridian Energy also sold the Dutch government 530,000 tonnes of carbon credits from Te Apiti. The price per tonne {{was considered to be}} about $10.40 a tonne. In both cases, the carbon credits for Te Apiti were from New Zealand's <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> allocated under the Kyoto Protocol. The New Zealand Government granted the AAUs to Meridian Energy as an incentive for carbon neutral power development under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme (or PRE).|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{receiving}} credit for JI projects is somewhat complex. Emission reduction projects are awarded credits called Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), which represents an emission reduction equivalent to one tonne of CO2 equivalent. The ERUs {{come from the}} host country's pool of assigned emissions credits, known as <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Units,</b> or AAUs. Each Annex I party has a predetermined amount of AAUs, calculated {{on the basis of}} its 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels. By requiring JI credits to come from a host country's pool of AAUs, the Kyoto Protocol ensures that the total amount of emissions credits among Annex I parties does not change for the duration of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fall of the}} Soviet Union led {{to massive}} {{restructuring}} and deindustrialization {{of many of the}} former Soviet Bloc. When the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated, there were several mechanisms that allowed for trading of emissions credits. These included credits produced under the Joint Initiative (JI) provision: Emission Reduction Unit credits; the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Certified Emission Reduction credits; and <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> <b>Units</b> (AAU) now also widely known as Hot Air in the post Soviet context. These were given to Russia as an incentive to sign the treaty. Critical climate change experts decry these credits as a way for countries to buy their way out of taking action to address climate change.|$|R
50|$|Annex I Parties {{may also}} use International Emissions Trading (IET). Under the treaty, for the 5-year {{compliance}} period from 2008 until 2012, nations that emit {{less than their}} quota {{will be able to}} sell <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (each AAU representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of CO2) to nations that exceed their quotas. It is also possible for Annex I countries to sponsor carbon projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries. These projects generate tradable carbon credits that can be used by Annex I countries in meeting their caps. The project-based Kyoto Mechanisms are the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI). There are four such international flexible mechanisms, or Kyoto Mechanism, written in the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
5|$|In August 2009, {{forestry}} {{companies were}} selling units to NZ and international buyers. Forester Ernslaw One converted 520,000 NZ <b>units</b> into <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> {{and sold them}} to the Norwegian Government, in a landmark ground breaking deal brokered by leading New Zealand carbon broker, Carbon Market Solutions Ltd. At the time, {{it was the largest}} forestry carbon credit deal in the world. Industry sources estimated the prices were approximately $NZ21 to $NZ22 a tonne and that value of the trade would have been between $NZ10.9 million and $NZ11.4 million, depending on the exchange rate. Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{signed the}} Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC on 22 May 1998 and {{ratified}} it on 19 December 2002. New Zealand's target is to limit net {{greenhouse gas emissions}} for the five-year 2008-2012 commitment period to five times the 1990 gross volume of GHG emissions. New Zealand may meet this target by either reducing emissions or by obtaining carbon credits from the international market or from domestic carbon sinks. The credits may be any of the Kyoto units; <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAU), removal units (RMU), Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In April 2012, the projection of New Zealand's net Kyoto position was a surplus of 23.1 million emissions units valued at NZ$189 million, based on an international carbon price of 5.03 Euro per tonne. On 9 November 2012, the New Zealand Government announced it would make climate pledges for the period from 2013 to 2020 under the UNFCCC process instead of adopting a binding limit under a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the development trends {{and conditions of}} the Russian economy, specifically its energy sector. It also reviews the projections of carbon emissions by 2020 and beyond {{in the context of}} the Russian government's scenarios of economic development. The second section of the report focuses on Russia's position in the negotiation process on a post- 2012 climate regime, including the emission limitation pledge, carry-over of the surplus of <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAU) beyond 2012 and the forest carbon sinks. The report is written by Dr George Safonov, State University - Higher School of Economics/ Russian Environmental Defense Fund and Dr Oleg Lugovoy, Russian Environmental Defense Fund and Dr Anna Korppoo, the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. The Nordic Ministers of Environments established the Nordic COP 15 Group early in 2008. In January 2010 the group was renamed to the Nordic ad hoc Group on Global Climate Negotiations. The main tasks of the group are to prepare reports and studies, conduct relevant meetings and organize conferences supporting the Nordic negotiators in the UN climate negotiations. The overall aim of the group is to contribute to a global and comprehensive agreement on climate change with ambitious emission reduction commitments...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, energy {{efficiency}} in the Latvian industrial sector {{has not been}} structurally addressed {{and only a few}} activities have been implemented to promote energy efficiency in the sector. The industrial sector is considered to be the main driving force for economic growth in Latvia, especially after the economic crisis that Latvia experienced in 2008 and 2009. Therefore, it is even more important to prepare a suitable environment for efficient production, by producing more products and goods with less energy consumption. However, different studies indicate that the energy intensity of Latvian industries is still very high compared to the EU- 15. In order to sustain economic growth, {{there is a need for}} the Latvian industrial sector to become more efficient and reduce its energy intensity. The Green Investment Scheme (GIS) is a programme that was developed in Latvia in 2007 to increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Funding of the programme is assured from public revenues by selling the <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> <b>units</b> (AAUs) within the Kyoto protocol. In 2010, the first official programme to support energy efficiency for industry was announced under the GIS. The first lessons learnt show that there is a necessity for such a programme in order to increase the energy efficiency in the Latvian industrial sector...|$|R
