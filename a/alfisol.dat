Soils were equilibrated with various concentrations of atrazine using batch techniques. Adsorption affinity for atrazine was approximated by Freundlich constant (Kf), {{which is a}} measure of the strength or degree of adsorption.

Partitioning of dry matter into grain yield was less affected by time of sowing, soil and season in extra-short-duration pigeonpea genotypes than in short-season legumes.

With suitable examples from India and West Africa, variations in the amount and distribution of rainfall {{as well as its}} intensity are described. The role of soil constraints, such as depth, soil w 2048 ater storage capacity, particle size distribution, and soil moisture release characteristics in making water available for crop growth on <b>Alfisols,</b> is illustrated. At soil depths below 30 cm in <b>Alfisols</b> the recharge and depletion of soil water occurred on an annual basis whereas, in the upper 30 cm, the process occurred repeatedly with a periodicity determined by the depth, amount, and frequency of rainfall. In the upper 30 cm soil layers with decreasing capillary potential there was a large decrease in the water content, while in the lower layers this decrease was considerably less. The effect of short-term intraseasonal droughts on crop moisture status was shown to differ depending on soil depth.

In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on <b>Alfisols,</b> yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous LUS and length of the previous cropping phase.

We compare the performance of partialleast-squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and their combinations (DWT–PLSR and DWT–SVR) to estimate soil nutrient content. The DRS models were generated for extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), boron (B), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) content in Vertisols and <b>Alfisols</b> and were compared using residual prediction deviation (RPD) of validation dataset.

40|$|Understanding of the {{hydrological}} {{behavior of}} soils {{is a prerequisite}} for developing appropriate soil and water management practices. Such information for <b>Alfisols</b> and Vertisols, the two major soils in the semi-arid tropics (SATs), is scanty especially from a long-term perspective. In this paper, we describe and discuss results from long-term (from 1976 to 2010) hydrological studies conducted on small agricultural watersheds on Vertisols and <b>Alfisols</b> at the ICRISAT Center, Patancheru, India. The hydrological behavior of soils are characterized in terms of runoff volume, peak runoff rate, number of runoff events, soil loss, sediment concentration and deep drainage loss under different rainfall, crop cover and soil moisture conditions to aid in developing effective soil and water management practices. We also provide details on the effects of annual and monthly rainfall on the hydrological behavior of these soils in different rainfall regions. The results show that <b>Alfisols</b> and Vertisols in the SATs have very contrasting hydrological behavior. Several findings emerging from our studies, are rather unexpected. For example, the sandy <b>Alfisols</b> with higher saturated hydrological conductivity generated higher runoff compared to the clayey Vertisols with extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity. The undesirable early season runoff from <b>Alfisols</b> is higher than from Vertisols. The contribution of 1 – 2 big storms to annual runoff and soil loss was high on both soils. The contrasting hydrological behavior of these two soils is due to differences in soil characteristics such as crusting, sealing and low structural stability in Alfisols; and the presence of cracks during the early season and formation of micro-cracks during rainless periods in Vertisols. The results suggest that the information from the long-term hydrological studies is useful for determining appropriate soil and water management practices and strategies in different rainfall regions...|$|R
