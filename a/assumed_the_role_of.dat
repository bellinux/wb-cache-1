5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had <b>assumed</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E
5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be {{impregnated}} by roving Lazuli male Carlos.

Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E
5|$|Democratic Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler {{was on the}} {{investigating}} {{committee and}} <b>assumed</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> prosecutor when hearings began on March 12, 1924. Jess Smith had engaged in influence peddling before his suicide, conspiring with two other Ohioans, Howard Mannington and Fred A. Caskey, to accept payoffs from alcohol bootleggers to secure either immunity from prosecution or the release of liquor from government warehouses. Mannington and Caskey's residence became infamous as the Little Green House on K Street. Some witnesses, such as Smith's divorced wife Roxy Stinson, and corrupt former FBI agent Gaston Means, alleged that Daugherty was personally involved. Coolidge requested Daugherty's resignation when the Attorney General indicated {{that he would not}} allow Wheeler's committee access to Justice Department records, and Daugherty complied on March 28, 1924.|$|E

5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements <b>assumed</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E

That evening, then-Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin issued a decision to eradicate Falun Gong. At Jiang's direction, on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party's Central Committee to manage the persecution. The resulting organisation, called the 6-10 Office, <b>assumed</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies. On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong. The following day, hundreds of practitioners were detained by security forces.|$|E
