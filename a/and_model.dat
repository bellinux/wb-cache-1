40|$|Background: The family, {{and parents}} in particular, are {{considered}} the most important influencers regarding children’s energy-balance related behaviours (EBRBs). When children become older and gain more behavioural autonomy regarding different behaviours, the parental influences may become less important and peer influences may gain importance. Therefore the current study aims to investigate simultaneous and interactive associations of family rules, parent and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with soft drink intake, TV viewing, daily breakfast consumption and sport participation among schoolchildren across Europe. Methods: A school-based cross-sectional survey in eight countries across Europe among 10 – 12 year old schoolchildren. Child questionnaires {{were used to assess}} EBRBs (soft drink intake, TV viewing, breakfast consumption, sport participation), and potential determinants of these behaviours as perceived by the child, including family rules, parental and friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling.</b> Linear <b>and</b> logistic regression analyses (n = 7811) were applied to study the association of parental (norms, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> rules) and friend influences (norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling)</b> with the EBRBs. In addition, potential moderating effects of parental influences on the associations of friend influences with the EBRBs were studied by including interaction terms. Results: Children reported more unfavourable friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> regarding soft drink intake and TV viewing, while they reported more favourable friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> for breakfast consumption and physical activity. Perceived friend and parental norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> were significantly positively associated with soft drink intake, breakfast consumption, physical activity (only <b>modelling)</b> <b>and</b> TV time. Across the different behaviours, ten significant interactions between parental and friend influencing variables were found and suggested a weaker association of friend norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> when rules were in place. Conclusion: Parental and friends norm <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> are associated with schoolchildren’s energy balance-related behaviours. Having family rules or showing favourable parental <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> norms seems to reduce the potential unfavourable associations of friends’ norms <b>and</b> <b>modelling</b> with the EBRBs...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the study of scientific theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> by using a speech-act-theoretic framework to investigate the discursive aspect of theorizing <b>and</b> <b>modeling</b> practices. In the philosophical study of science some of the central questions concern the nature of theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> how they are used by scientists. There is debate about whether theories are best understood as representations or as tools useful for non-representational purposes, and among those that think they are representations there is disagreement about what kinds of representations they are. I argue here that a systematic investigation of the discursive aspect of theorizing <b>and</b> <b>modeling</b> practices can be useful to this debate: it offers a rich source of evidence which different accounts of theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> can be evaluated against. Theorizing <b>and</b> <b>modeling</b> often involves the presentation of a series of sentences and equations. In these cases the uttered expressions are constitutive parts of a discourse within which theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are presented <b>and</b> used. I consider the influential work of Cartwright, French, Giere, van Fraassen and others, to show that different accounts of what theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are have implications for what function expressions can be expected to play in discourse. By observing how sentences and equations are actually used by scientists I argue we can determine which accounts best capture scientific practice. Here speech act theory provides a framework for systematically identifying features of discourse that indicate how expressions are used by scientists on a case-by-case basis. I also defend the view that theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are often linguistic representations in which sentences and equations are used by scientists to say things directly about the systems they study. This runs contrary both to instrumentalist views, which take theories to be non-representational, and to the semantic view, which takes theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> to be non-linguistic. I defend my view by showing the discursive data drawn from a canonical example, the London model of superconductivity, unambiguously favours my account. On the basis of this evidence and additional considerations I conclude that many other theories <b>and</b> <b>models</b> are likely linguistic representations too...|$|R
