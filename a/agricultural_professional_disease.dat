40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} is a farming {{system that is}} considered by some to have beneficial impacts on the future sustainability of agriculture. Although some research has studied the attitudes of consumers and farmers, in particular what factors influence the willingness of consumers to pay organic premiums and what factors influence farmers to adopt organic farming, no studies have considered what influences the attitudes of <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> (extension officers, scientists, academics and researchers). Given the key role that <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> play in influencing farmer adoption of agricultural innovations and conducting research, their views on farming systems may be critical for overall adoption. This study reports {{the results of a}} telephone survey conducted in 2004, with 185 <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> surveyed for their views towards organic farming. A particular aim was to study how increased knowledge and experience influenced attitudes towards organic agriculture. Using an ordered probit regression framework, some of the significant key influences on attitudes towards organic farming were: knowledge; experience; education; informational; occupational effects; and attitudes on the individual aspects of organic agriculture. The study finds support for the hypothesis that professionals with increased organic knowledge and experience are more likely to think favourably about organic agriculture. ...|$|R

In 1994, a dozen grass-based {{farmers and}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> formed an {{association}} called the Central Wisconsin River Graziers Network {{with the following}} mission statement: To promote the feasibility of grazing-based farming as a profitable way of farming that enhances lifestyles and protects and improves the environment. To meet the increased technical and educational needs of the landowners and Graziers Network, the Marathon and Lincoln County Land Conservation Committees developed a joint project to advance Managed Intensive Grazing (MIG) as a resource practice. In 1998, the Lincoln and Marathon County Managed Intensive Grazing Project was established as a three (3) year project.

Objectives: Aim of our study was to determined all number of recognized <b>professional</b> <b>diseases</b> in our country, {{as well as to}} see which of industries are with highest prevalence of professional hearing damage caused by noise. Materials and method: We use an cohort study for analyzing patient histories which were hospitalized in the Institute of occupational health. All of them have recognized <b>professional</b> <b>disease</b> hearing loss. In order to be recognized as cases of a professional hearing damage, all of them had to satisfy all legal requirements. Results: Average age of patients with professional damage of cochlear nerve was 50 y. They have high total time period as well as exposed time period.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} scientific paradigms and draws parallels with paradigms in agriculture, and in particular focuses upon organic farming and genetic engineering. There is anecdotal evidence that they are both potential new agricultural paradigms. Different writers have referred to both as new 'paradigms' in agriculture, though the qualitative evidence is stronger for organic farming than genetic engineering. The attitudes of <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> are important as {{they are responsible for}} creating, developing and diffusing innovations as well as informing and educating farmers and the public. This paper summarizes past research on the attitudes of Australian <b>agricultural</b> <b>professionals</b> (n=l 85) towards organic farming (Wheeler 2008) and genetic engineering (Wheeler pending). These two sets of results are compared to assess if professional attitudes to the two innovations are driven by similar influences or · are quantitatively significantly different. In addition, analysis using bivariate ordered pro bit regression is conducted in this study on the nature of professionals' answers to the net benefits of the two innovations themselves. Do professionals tend to be negative or positive about both innovations, or positive about one and negative about the other? From a comparison of the results, it is shown there is some quantitative evidence that organic farming represents a potential new sub-paradigm in agriculture, but only very weak. evidence that genetic engineering is a potential new paradigm. ...|$|R
