5000|$|When a DLA {{member state}} {{receives}} a report concerning its drivers from a non-DLA member state, the member state {{will be required}} to treat the report the same as if it came from a member state. As with the previous compacts, the DLA requires a state to post all out-of-state traffic convictions to the driver's record, and a state must apply its own laws to all out-of-state convictions. As with the previous compacts, the DLA allows other jurisdictions to <b>access</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle records, in accordance with the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), and to transfer the driver's history if the driver transfers his license. [...] The DLA has some changes from the NRVC. Unlike the NRVC, under the DLA, adverse action can be taken against a driver for not responding to violations such as equipment violations, registration violations, parking violations, and weight limit violations. Other changes from the NRVC are that in order for a driver to keep his license under the NRVC, he just had to respond to the citation by paying the fine. With the DLA, the driver must comply with any order from the out of state court. An example would be a driver from Arizona getting cited for tinted windows while traveling through Virginia, even though the tinted windows are legal back at home. The driver is ordered to fix the tint to meet Virginia law even though the driver left Virginia. Under the NRVC, to retain said license, the driver just pays the fine but with DLA, the driver must do what the court says including paying a fine, but also fixing vehicle equipment, and/or community service.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{field of}} motor {{rehabilitation}} {{is in need}} of more efficient and effective rehabilitation strategies. Each year, almost 2. 5 million Americans suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and roughly 800, 000 Americans experience a stroke. 1, 2 The total annual direct and indirect costs of stroke and TBI in the United States are $ 65. 5 billion and between $ 48 and $ 56 billion, respectively. 3, 4 A promising new approach may lie in using sound as a neuromodulatory tool to <b>access</b> <b>motor</b> areas of the brain.

In this paper, activities on the use of PNS interfaces for the control of hand prosthesis are presented.

40|$|Introduction:Olive leaves {{have been}} {{recommended}} {{in the scientific}} literature and traditional medicine as a cure {{for the treatment of}} diabetes and this plant has powerful antioxidants and neuroprotective effects. Here, we studied the possible effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) on motor deficits in diabetic neuropathy. Methods:The rotarod treadmill test was used to <b>access</b> <b>motor</b> coordination in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Different doses of OLE (100, 300 and 500 mg/kg, i. g.) were given. Serum glucose and insulin levels were assessed by specific kits. Results:Four weeks after diabetes induction, glucose level was significantly decreased and insulin concentration increased (P< 0. 001). The rotarod treadmill test showed a marked impairment of the motor coordination of the diabetic animals (P< 0. 001). The retention time of the diabetic animals was reduced by 61. 2 % compared to the control animals, whereas treatment with 300 mg/kg OLE increased retention time to 83. 6 % of the control values. That dose had a moderate lowering effect on serum glucose with no effect on insulin levels. Conclusion:The results suggest that olive leaf extract has protective effects against high glucose-induced motor defects in diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEach {{time there}} is an {{interaction}} with the environment, we select one among many, equally possible, actions. How is it done? In the classical view, to <b>access</b> <b>motor</b> resources, many cortical action plans compete in the basal ganglia: a set of subcortical neuron populations, whose output constantly inhibits specific thalamic targets. In the basal ganglia, one cortical plan is selected, the corresponding thalamic inhibition is disabled, finally producing the action (Albin et al., 1989). The classical view of action selection is now extended, including thalamic afferents. And, in the current view, a key role as modulators of action selection has been assigned to cholinergic interneurons of the striatum, the largest basal ganglia structure (Ding et al., 2010). Striatum is divided in two major populations of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) according to different expression of D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptors. These two populations and their downstream pathways are respectively addressed as direct and indirect, for their connections with output basal structures (Tepper and Bolam, 2004). More than 90 % of striatal neurons are MSNs while the remaining 5 – 10 % {{are two types of}} interneurons, cholinergic, and GABAergic. These are providing the lateral inhibition that can actually implement the competition among cortical plans and therefore are a key to understand action selection. Cholinergic interneurons are known as tonically active neurons (TANs) for their spontaneous activity (> 4 Hz). They receive glutamatergic afferents from cortex and thalamus, forming more synapses with thalamic than cortical terminals (Doig et al., 2014), and dopaminergic afferents from substantia nigra pars compacta. Locally, they branch dendritic arborization up to a millimeter in diameter, and they innervate GABAergic interneurons, other TANs and MSNs (Tepper and Bolam, 2004). Under resting conditions, MSNs are hyperpolarized by TANs spontaneous tonic firing (Tepper and Bolam, 2004). Morris et al. (2004) showed that increased cortical activity makes TANs respond with a brief burst, an afterhyperpolarization pause in their firing, and a rebound burst. In addition, Ding et al. (2010) have shown, in vitro, that also thalamic stimuli elicit TAN burst-pause pattern response. The work of Doig et al. (2014) aims at functionally distinguish thalamic and cortical contributions to action selection. Using different stimuli (single-, paired-pulse, and pulse trains) selectively delivered in the cortex and thalamus of rats, they were able to identify two temporal TAN response patterns. As in Morris et al. (2004), they used peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) analysis to identify the three main phases in TAN response: burst, pause and rebound. Applying pulse trains, which mimic the timing of motivationally salient stimuli (Ding et al., 2010), they were able to discriminate cortical and thalamic stimuli, predicting the whole TAN response based only on the initial phase. In fact, the number of spikes in the burst correlated positively with pause length and negatively with the magnitude of rebound: thalamic source was identified by high initial phase, long pause and low rebound, while cortical source was marked by lower initial phase, short pause, and higher rebound (Figure 1 A) ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Motor imagery (MI) is {{the mental}} {{rehearsal}} of a motor first person action-representation. There is interest in using MI to <b>access</b> the <b>motor</b> network after stroke. Conventional fMRI modelling {{has shown that}} MI and executed movement (EM) activate similar cortical areas but it remains unknown whether they share cortical networks. Proving this is central to using MI to <b>access</b> the <b>motor</b> network and {{as a form of}} motor training. Here we use multivariate analysis (tensor independent component analysis-TICA) to map the array of neural networks involved during MI and EM. Methods Fifteen right-handed healthy volunteers (mean-age 28. 4 yrs) were recruited and screened for their ability to carry out MI (Chaotic MI Assessment). fMRI consisted of an auditory-paced (1 Hz) right hand finger-thumb opposition sequence (2, 3, 4, 5; 2 …) with two separate runs acquired (MI & rest and EM & rest: block design). No distinction was made between MI and EM until the final stage of processing. This allowed TICA to identify independent-components (IC) that are common or distinct to both tasks with no prior assumptions. Results TICA defined 52 ICs. Non-significant ICs and those representing artefact were excluded. Components in which the subject scores were significantly different to zero (for either EM or MI) were included. 7 independent components remained. There were IC’s shared between EM and MI involving the contralateral BA 4, PMd, parietal areas and SMA. IC’s exclusive to EM involved the contralateral BA 4, S 1 and ipsilateral cerebellum whereas the IC related exclusively to MI involved ipsilateral BA 4 and PMd. Conclusion In addition to networks specific to each task indicating a degree of independence, we formally demonstrate {{here for the first time}} that MI and EM share cortical networks. This significantly strengthens the rationale for using MI to <b>access</b> the <b>motor</b> networks, but the results also highlight important differences...|$|R
