5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary peers {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual <b>and</b> <b>Temporal,</b> a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual <b>and</b> <b>Temporal</b> only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who {{are not part of the}} House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

5|$|Sustainability {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems.

5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal spatial <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources {{to be placed}} within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E

This increase in gamma oscil-lations was not seen in other frequency bands, whose activity generally decreased during successful memory formation.
