Simultaneously, its foreign debt rose sharply due to the accrued interests, being at the end of 2000 substantially higher than Serbian gross domestic product. Thanks to the write-off of 51 % of debt towards the Paris club, a windfall of donations and obtaining new favorable medium-term and long-term credits, the condition of Serbia's international financial relations considerably improved in the period 2001 - 2003, thus enabling it to run a foreign-exchange surplus during this period. Due to the policy of de facto floating exchange rate, sudden and drastic liberalization of imports and the lack of non-tariff protection, exports of goods and services in the last three years, contrary to plans, have increased much more slowly than imports, resulting in a large increase in growth and an enormously high level of trade deficit unsustainable in the long run. Due to new credits euro-denominated and other foreign-currency denominated debts being converted into the increasingly weaker dollar and the <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> Serbian foreign debt increased sharply reaching an all-time high {{at the end of last}} year and being twice as high as was officially predicted three years before.

40|$|In {{the article}} the modern methods of {{crediting}} businesses in Ukraine {{have been considered}} and practical recommendations on choosing a particular form and method of crediting, which depends {{on the characteristics of}} the borrower activities, its creditworthiness, crediting purposes and objects have been offered. Today the most common crediting methods in the banking practice are: credit line, overdraft, non-instalment term credit. Each of these methods has its own characteristics, which are suitable for specific areas of the organization activity. It has been found that the credit line benefit is that the borrower is given an opportunity within the fixed limit to use the credit funds immediately at the moment the need arises, which in its turn allows reducing the cost of the credit servicing, however, the main disadvantage of this method of crediting is {{that in the case of}} difficulties with the repayment of the previous tranche the bank may reduce or cancel the credit limit and enter an additional fee on the unclaimed credit line limit. Overdraft crediting is characterized by a rapid procedure of obtaining a credit, can be granted without security, does not have a targeted character, allows providing payments from the current account, at the same time the interest rate on the overdraft is higher than that on other credits, and another disadvantage is the requirement of mandatory and in a certain, relatively short time repaying the credit. Crediting in terms of lump-sum cash disbursement is characterized by simplicity in granting and consistency in the organization of the crediting process, but the <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> occurs immediately after the transfer of funds to the borrower on the full amount of the received credit. Thus, when deciding on obtaining a bank credit the entrepreneur has to choose one or another method of crediting taking into account all the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen method...|$|R

Although compound interest was not permitted to be charged in practice (each loan matured at a given date), investors could keep ploughing back their funds into new loans. Through the ages, this essentially logarithmic principle has described how loan capital grows independently of the ability of debtors (or the economy at large) to pay. It has been expressed by dramatists such as Shakespeare, by novelists, and by eighteenth-century actuaries and economists. Before the contrast between “geometric” and “arithmetic” rates of increase were made famous by Malthus in his description of population growth tendencies, it was formulated {{with reference to the}} work on public debt by Richard Price.

40|$|A sale of {{real estate}} is financed by the seller, and the buyer's initial {{investment}} is not sufficient for recognition of profit under the full accrual method. The seller meets the conditions of Statement 66 to record a sale and recognizes profit on the installment or cost recovery methods. Subsequently, the buyer defaults on the mortgage to the seller, and the seller forecloses on the property. At the time of foreclosure, fair value of the property is less than the seller's gross receivable but greater than the seller's net receivable, that is, the principal and interest receivable less the deferred profit on the sale and related allowances. The issue is the amount at which the foreclosed property should be recorded.

40|$|Excerpt] The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 5, {{also known}} as ARRA or the 2009 {{stimulus}} package), contains several provisions affecting unemployment benefits, described below. • ARRA increases unemployment benefits by $ 25 per week for all recipients of regular unemployment compensation (UC), extended benefits (EB), emergency unemployment compensation (EUC 08), Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA). Supplemental compensation would be available from the time a state enters into {{an agreement with the}} Labor Secretary and ending before January 1, 2010 (with grandfathering). • The act extends the temporary EUC 08 program through December 26, 2009 (with grandfathering), to be financed by federal general revenues. • It provides for 100 % federal financing of the EB program to end before January 1, 2010 (with grandfathering), to be financed by the federal government through the Unemployment Trust Fund. • ARRA allows states the option of changing temporarily the eligibility requirements for the EB program in order to expand the number of persons eligible for EB benefits, to end before June 1, 2010. • It provides for an additional 13 weeks to the maximum amount of time railroad workers may receive extended unemployment benefits. • The legislation suspends income taxation on the first $ 2, 400 of unemployment benefits received in 2009, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008. • It provides relief to states from the payment and <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on federal loans to states for the payment of unemployment benefits, from enactment of the stimulus package on February 17, 2009 through December 31, 2010. • ARRA provides for a special transfer of up to $ 7 billion in federal monies to state unemployment programs as “incentive payments” for changing certain state UC laws. All incentive payments must be made before October 1, 2011. States do not need to repay these sums to the federal government. Any changes that states make to state unemployment programs as a result of ARRA’s modernization provisions would be permanent. • Finally, the act transfers a total of $ 500 million to the states for administering their unemployment programs, within 30 days of enactment of the 2009 stimulus package. States do not need to repay these sums to the federal government. This report addresses some of the more common questions about unemployment insurance in the 2009 stimulus package.

40|$|Section 24 J is {{regarded}} {{to be one}} of the most complex provisions in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. This study specifically focuses on the income tax treatment of section 24 Jinstruments denominated in a foreign currency, specifically with regards to whether such instruments are fixed or variable rate instruments for purposes of section 24 J and the interaction between section 24 J, section 25 D (foreign currency translation rules) and section 24 I (gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions). The basic concepts surrounding the incurral and <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for income tax purposes, as well as of some of the general issues faced when section 24 J is practically applied are discussed. Importantly it is found that although the definition of 'instrument' includes all debt instruments, regardless of whether such instruments are interest-bearing, the application of section 24 J would have no impact on the issuer or holder of an instrument that is a non-interest bearing debt instrument. Also, the section 24 J definition of 'interest' is wider than the common law meaning of the same term. However, as 'interest'is defined with reference to itself, the common law meaning is still very relevant. It is confirmed that section 24 J poses various interpretational uncertainties which are especially highlighted when some of the key provisions of section 24 J are applied in determining the interest accrual amounts based on the yield to maturity method. Applying the rules of statutory interpretation and with the aid of hypothetical examples, itis argued that foreign exchange rates would fall within the definition of a variable rate for purposes of section 24 J. However, an instrument denominated in a foreign currency would be regarded as a fixed rate instrument to the extent that the amounts payable are fixed amounts specified in the applicable foreign currency or the calculation of the amount payable in the applicable foreign currency does not involve the application of a 'variable rate' (as defined). Further is it argued that section 24 J merely provides for a single accrual or incurral event during each year of assessment in relation to each instrument. Therefore, where accrual amounts be denominated in a foreign currency it should be translated at the spot rate on the last day of the year of assessment (or on the date of redemption/transfer in the instance where the instrument was transferred/redeemed during the year of assessment) for purposes of determining the sum of the accrual amounts to be included in taxable income. It is also argued that the timing of the accrual and incurral of interest amounts in terms of section 24 J is applied in establishing the 'transaction date' of the interest amount owing for purposes of determining 'exchange differences' at the end of any year of assessment in terms of section 24 I...|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting {{by governments}} {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level <b>of</b> moving towards <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting, while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward accrual basis, central government accounting officials are still using (modified) cash basis accounting. Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash basis to <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour <b>of</b> moving toward <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting. Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting. E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from cash basis accounting to <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption.
