5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> front.|$|E

5|$|Technically, kulintang is the Maguindanao, Ternate and Timor {{term for}} the idiophone of metal gong kettles which are laid {{horizontally}} upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety groups and languages, the kulintang is also called kolintang by the Maranao and those in Sulawesi, kulintangan, gulintangan by those in Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago and totobuang by those in central Maluku.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to medieval Europe. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{area around the}} Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, {{in a wide range}} of institutions.|$|E

5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane {{moved to the}} northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western Florida. At its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> swath of the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate has}} played out <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms like the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments {{on the best}} approach to the problem, {{but most of the}} participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow {{is found}} in remote parts of Central Asia, where its {{distribution}} is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It {{is found in}} deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it seems to have}} lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by overgrazing.|$|E

5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weeks scouts were {{sent out to}} try to make contact with local Mopan and Ch'ol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxB'ol and Manche without success – most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of AjChan's embassy to Mérida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men at Lake Petén Itzá, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned the unfinished fort. Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Ch'ol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> swathe of southern Petén was forcibly relocated to Belén near Rabinal in Verapaz. This relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including oidor José de Escals and even by Amésqueta.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{became aware}} of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying {{extensive}} new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe Jacques de Duve, who was interned {{for the rest of the}} war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for Operation Crossbow, the ongoing bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V-1 launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.|$|E
50|$|Within the SA, an Oberscharführer was {{typically}} a squad leader, answering to a platoon non-commissioned officer.

50|$|The festival {{expanded}} from {{five days to}} six {{and for the first}} time began on a Saturday. Screenings took place <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> range of more unusual venues in Sheffield and the Peak District. 130 films were shown, of which 21 were world premieres, 24 UK premieres, and 12 European premieres.|$|R
50|$|For {{compatibility}} reasons, {{the horizontal}} bandwidth remains at 5.0 MHz. This {{means that a}} PALplus signal provides no extra horizontal resolution {{to compensate for the}} image being stretched <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> screen. The result is a horizontal resolution that is 73% of the vertical resolution, or 51% when the Kell factor is ignored.|$|R
5|$|The battle {{forces are}} {{generally}} described as in Morrissey. His numbers are generally {{consistent with other}} sources on the British units, although there is disagreement <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> array of sources {{on the number of}} troops under Breymann, which are generally listed at either approximately 550 or 650. Morrissey is also incorrect in identifying some of the American units. He identifies William Gregg as having a separate command; Gregg apparently led several companies in Nichols' regiment. Morrissey also failed to include the Massachusetts militia, and misidentified Langdon's company, erroneously believing they may have been from Worcester, Massachusetts. (Militia companies from the Worcester area marched on Bennington, with some companies arriving the day after the battle.) Langdon originally raised his company in 1776, but it did not become a cavalry unit until 1778.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{continues}} roughly north and crosses a largely open area of pasture. The SouthCare emergency helicopter is stationed {{to the east}} of the road not far after its intersection with Lanyon Drive, and further on, a prison is located to the west. Approaching the northern end of the pasture, Jerrabomberra Creek flows to the east. At the northern end is the Hindmarsh Drive interchange. The highway passes underneath Hindmarsh Drive and continues over Jerrabomberra Creek. A further interchange, passing over Canberra Avenue is a little further on, along with an overpass above the Canberra railway line branch, and an interchange above Newcastle Street. The road then doglegs <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> flat and terminates at Morshead Drive, just across the Molonglo River. In 2010 the average annual daily traffic count was approximately 43,000 vehicles per day, at this final section just prior to the northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|The sites {{began to}} pass into varied private ownership. Lord Thomas Bulkeley bought Beaumaris from the Crown in 1807, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence. Conwy Castle was leased by {{the descendants of the}} Conways to the Holland family. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the ruined castles started to be considered picturesque and sublime, attracting visitors and artists from <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> area. The fashion was encouraged by the events of the Napoleonic Wars {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, which made it difficult for British artists to visit the continent, leading many to travel to North Wales instead. These artists included John Cotman, Henry Gastineau, Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Ibbetson, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner and John Varley. The sites became heavily overgrown with ivy and other vegetation. In the 1830s the stonework of Caenarfon Castle began to collapse, and the Crown employed Anthony Salvin to conduct emergency repairs.|$|E

5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant (Anairetes parulus) is {{a species}} of bird in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. This species is found in western South America; its range {{stretches}} from southern Colombia south along the Andes mountains to Tierra del Fuego. It prefers to live in upper montane forests and shrublands; however, it is a habitat generalist {{and can be found}} <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of ecosystems. The tufted tit-tyrant has three subspecies, including the nominate subspecies Anairetes parulus parulus, A. p. aequatorialis, and A. p. patagonicus, and is very closely related to the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant. It is very small with a distinctive and conspicuous crest. The bird's head is black overall with white supraloral and postocular stripes. Its dull grayish-brown back contrasts with its white throat and breast that are covered with black streaks and pale, unmarked yellow underbelly. There are few noticeable differences in plumage between the subspecies. It is a vocal flycatcher with a broad repertoire of songs.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{blizzard}} conditions wrought {{havoc on}} transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports {{were forced to}} close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The New York Stock Exchange opened an hour late on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel. Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286deaths <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including automobile and maritime accidents, storm-related fires, carbon monoxide poisoning, over-exertion, and exposure to cold.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} {{following}} Florida's annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during {{the establishment of}} the Florida territory are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General Andrew Jackson was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the Suwannee River, either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the First Seminole War, and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border—previously named Cowford—to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S. Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. Steamboats heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races. By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, Charleston, and Savannah were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.|$|E
