5000|$|During War time, Police {{officers}} and their auxiliary support {{were not allowed}} to resign. In June 1945, {{in response to a question}} in the House Sir D Somervell, Secretary of State for the Home Department announced the discontinuation of this restriction on PAMs:“Yes, Sir. I am glad to say that the war-time restrictions on the liberty to resign of part-time special constables and part-time members of the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and the police <b>auxiliary</b> <b>messenger</b> service will come to an end on the 1st July.” [...] This effectively resulted in the disbandment of the Police <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Messenger</b> Service and its replacement with Police Cadets.|$|E
50|$|The Police <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Messenger</b> Service {{is little}} known in {{literature}} {{but a recent}} book, Blitz PAMs, by John Orton, gives a semi-fictional account of {{the early years of}} the blitz on South Shields through the eyes of a 16 year old PAM. Although the story line (as told by Mossie Hamed, a grocery delivery boy of mixed Yemeni/Shields blood, which includes his ill fated love for Jackie Hansen, a girl who pretends to be a lad to become a PAM) is fictional, the accounts of the air raids on South Shields are as near fact as possible, based on the photographic archive held by South Tyneside Local Library Service.|$|E
50|$|Police <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Messengers</b> (PAMS) were {{operational}} in the UK during World War 2. Young lads {{under the}} age of eighteen with their own bikes were employed by local Police Forces with the primary role of taking messages during and after air raids if telephone communication was not practicable.|$|R

5000|$|Compound {{equipment}} - uses {{a second}} support wire, {{known as the}} [...] "auxiliary", between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire. Droppers support the <b>auxiliary</b> from the <b>messenger</b> wire, and additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary. The auxiliary wire can be of a more conductive but less wear-resistant metal, increasing the efficiency of power transmission.|$|R
5000|$|From the firsthand {{account of}} those who served as PAMs it seems that in some areas where there was little enemy bombing, e.g. Oxfordshire, that PAMS were used as extra pairs of hands {{to make up for}} lack of {{manpower}} particularly in the headquarters offices. [...] In areas targeted by the enemy the PAMs filled their primary role of taking messages during air raids but would also help the rescue services when needed. This was clearly the case in Coventry where PAMs proved their worth during the heavy bombing raids. George Frederick Barratt of the Coventry PAMs was awarded a British Empire Medal in June 1941 - his citation reads“Police Messenger Barratt, who was in the lower corridor of a building when it received a direct hit from a H.E. bomb, was blown by the blast for some distance. When he recovered he immediately made his way to report to the Main A.R.P. Control Centre and was sent out with a message. On the way he was blown off his cycle by blast. He remounted and continued his journey but ran into some broken telephone wires and sustained injuries to his neck. He delivered the message and returned with the reply. First aid treatment was obtained for him and although he was badly shaken again he went out through the rain of falling bombs to deliver other vital messages.”Another Coventry PAMs' citation for the B.E.M. reads:"Howard George Miles, Police Messenger, Police <b>auxiliary</b> <b>Messenger</b> Service, Coventry.During a severe enemy air attack Police Messenger Miles rendered great assistance by delivering urgent and important messages. He dealt with many incendiary bombs and, at grave risk to himself, helped to rescue a baby who was trapped in the wreckage of a house. Miles showed courage and devotion to duty.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1917/18 {{he joined}} the army and {{was sent to the}} Eastern Front where he served as an {{infantry}} <b>auxiliary</b> and <b>messenger.</b> He returned to Berlin and worked in a range of jobs, most of them involving the railways. He joined the Transport Workers' Trades Union in 1920, and in 1923 {{he joined the}} recently formed German Communist Party, which he later said he had done [...] "out of curiosity". He resigned from the party in 1924, but would later, in 1930, join it again, this time permanently. During the 1920s he held a succession of manual jobs, mostly involving transport or the building trade, but also including a period working as a packer in a soap factory. He participated in the occasional demonstration, but was not particularly active politically before 1930.|$|R
5|$|Spanish expeditions had {{frequently}} crossed Lempira's territory, {{particularly the}} Cares region, and they believed {{it to be}} pacified. In secret, Lempira planned an uprising near his stronghold at Peñol de Cerquín, {{and if it were}} successful, to follow it with a widespread revolt across his entire territory. Lempira strengthened the fortifications of the Peñol, and gathered large numbers of warriors, provisions, and weapons there. Hardened Spanish veterans of the European wars were struck by the strength of the fortifications, and favourably compared them with those they had seen in Europe. Towards the end of 1537, Lempira was ready. Natives abandoned their villages and gathered at the Peñol, and his warriors prepared for battle. Lempira sent messages to the native auxiliaries of the Spanish, exhorting them to abandon their foreign overlords and join his forces, but they refused. It was only with the declaration of war that the Spanish became aware of the threat presented by Lempira and his alliance. Although the immediate threat was limited to the region close to the Peñol de Cerquín, the Spanish realised that the rebellion at such a strong fortress was a powerful symbol of native independence throughout Higueras. Montejo immediately dispatched Cáceres against Lempira with 80 well-armed Spanish soldiers, accompanied by Mexican and Guatemalan Indian <b>auxiliaries.</b> Montejo sent <b>messengers</b> requesting assistance from Santiago de Guatemala and San Salvador.|$|R
