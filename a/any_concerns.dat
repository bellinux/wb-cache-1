5|$|Despite the cup {{success and}} arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th-place finish in 1972–73. Smith blamed the car crash and {{subsequent}} injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 {{as the cause}} for the club's mid-season slump, which compounded an already poor start to the season. <b>Any</b> <b>concerns</b> over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 1973–74, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club's fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in the last nine matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent's 29-match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a £250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} 2000 Act the {{government}} set up a postal regulator, the Postal Services Commission, known as Postcomm, which offered licences to private companies to deliver mail. In 2001, the Consumer Council for Postal Services, known as Postwatch, was created for consumers to express <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> they may have with the postal service in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the RTÉ Authority, the RTÉ Board has not the self-regulatory {{function}} over RTÉ, as {{this was}} transferred to a newly appointed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland that replaces the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland regulating commercial TV and radio. This helps assuage <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> {{of the potential for}} bias that could be perceived under previous self-regulation by having a single regulator of public service and commercial Irish broadasters into the future.|$|E
25|$|While Jennifer spoke {{against the}} {{positive}} feedback on Lucinda's leadership during the results, she was openly challenged by Lee in the 'losers' cafe' for not voicing <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> during the task, while Sir Alan {{did not hold}} Lucinda responsible for the team's loss, pointing out that both Jennifer and Lindi had made many of the mistakes in the tasks, including their poor judgement in sales tactics. While Jennifer was not fired, mainly because she had contributed more {{in the past four}} tasks than Lindi had done, she was warned that she was now on her last chance.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the long term psychological and physiological effects will vary by person and injury. For example, perinatal brain damage has been implicated in cases of neurodevelopmental impairments and psychiatric illnesses. If <b>any</b> <b>concerning</b> symptoms, signs, or changes to behaviors are occurring, a healthcare provider should be consulted. Different types and degrees of trauma will cause different effects, and if <b>any</b> <b>concerning</b> symptoms, signs, or changes to behaviors are occurring, a healthcare provider should be consulted.|$|R

25|$|During the Persian Gulf War, Iran-Oman {{relations}} were damaged after Iran began running attacks on tanker {{movements in the}} Persian Gulf and placed anti-ship missile launchers along the Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf neighbors have since restored their ties and have conducted joint military exercises as recently as February 2011. Oman’s leader Sultan Qaboos traveled to Iran in 2009 {{for the first time}} since Iran’s 1979 revolution. Though on two occasions the U.S. has dispatched high-level officials to discuss Iran with Oman, the fact that Oman has avoided publicly expressing <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding Iran’s nuclear program is likely a reason why the two states have managed to maintain strong ties.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} Māori as the {{indigenous}} people of New Zealand is recognised in New Zealand law by the term tangata whenua (lit."people of the land"), which identifies the traditional connection between Māori and a given area of land. Māori as a whole {{can be considered as}} tangata whenua of New Zealand entirely; individual iwi are recognised as tangata whenua for areas of New Zealand in which they are traditionally based, while hapū are tangata whenua within their marae. New Zealand law periodically requires consultation between the government and tangata whenua – for example, during major land development projects. This usually takes the form of negotiations between local or national government and the rūnanga of one or more relevant iwi, although the government generally decides which (if <b>any)</b> <b>concerns</b> are acted upon.|$|E
25|$|In other assemblies, however, an {{individual}} (after baptism) must show {{a commitment to}} a particular assembly by faithful attendance to as many assembly meetings as possible. In such assemblies, {{it is usually the}} recently baptized individual who will request fellowship, but not always, as any concerned assembly member may contact the individual to determine their intentions with regard to assembly fellowship. Once it is shown that the individual desires acceptance into assembly fellowship, that desire is then communicated to the gathered assembly so that all members may have opportunity to express <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding the applicant. Once the applicant meets with the approval of the assembly members, an announcement is made to the gathered assembly that the applicant will be received into full assembly fellowship, which would be the first Sunday (Lord’s Day) following the announcement.|$|E

500|$|Closing, Walker congratulated {{director}} Graeme Harper for demonstrating [...] "his incredible versatility" [...] in {{directing the}} vastly different [...] "The Unicorn and the Wasp" [...] and [...] "Turn Left", and wrote that <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> about the plot were [...] "overshadowed" [...] by the script's [...] "inventiveness, intelligence, and sheer boldness". He finished {{by calling the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most extraordinary}} in Doctor Whos long history". Walker ranked the story as his fifth-favourite episode of the fourth series: between [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Midnight".|$|E
500|$|The judge {{also read}} a sworn {{statement}} from Abaton's former producer, who stated {{that she had}} not known about the incident. She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening, but learned about the reasons for that only later, during the police investigation. The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed [...] from the stage. Promoter Tomáš Fiala testified that although this was not the case, the band had not expressed <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> to him either before or after the concert.|$|E
500|$|Before {{heading the}} ACLU, Ennis {{had served as}} {{general counsel for the}} INS. [...] In his oral {{argument}} supporting Afroyim, Ennis asserted that Congress lacked the power to prescribe forfeiture of citizenship, and he sharply criticized the foreign-relations argument under which the Perez court had upheld loss of citizenship for voting in a foreign election—pointing out, for example, that when a referendum was held in 1935 on the status of the Saar (a region of Germany occupied after World War I by the United Kingdom and France), Americans had participated in the voting without raising <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> within the State Department at the time.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the heated debate in the media, players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning Meckiff. Neither the England captain May nor manager Freddie Brown raised <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> about Meckiff's action after the Test. However, it was later revealed that Brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with the Australian Board of Control, but May had refused, fearing accusations of sour grapes. Years later, Richardson {{and some of his}} fellow batsmen accused the Australian fast bowler of throwing them out, while England paceman Fred Trueman said: [...] "Meckiff's action was totally illegal and that he should never have been allowed to play". Richardson's off spinning team-mate Jim Laker likened Meckiff's and Burke's arm actions to those of dart-throwers.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Yorkville Community Unit School District 115 {{released}} a statement reading: [...] "The District was first made aware of <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding Mr. Hastert when the federal indictment was released on May 28, 2015. Yorkville Community Unit School District #115 has no knowledge of Mr. Hastert's alleged misconduct, nor has any individual contacted the District to report any such misconduct. If requested to do so, the District plans to cooperate fully with the U.S. Attorney's investigation into this matter." [...] James Harnett, who was superintendent of the school district for five of the years that Hastert taught there, told the Chicago Tribune {{that he was not}} aware of any complaints of misconduct brought against Hastert at the time.|$|E
500|$|The LSAG review, {{issued on}} [...] after outside review, found [...] "no basis for <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> about the {{consequences}} of new particles or forms of matter that could possibly be produced by the LHC". The US Government, in response, called for summary dismissal of the suit against the government defendants as untimely due to the expiration of a six-year statute of limitations (since funding began by 1999 and has essentially been completed already), and also called the hazards claimed by the plaintiffs [...] "overly speculative and not credible". The Hawaii District Court heard the government's motion to dismiss on , and on 26 September the Court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss {{on the grounds that it}} had no jurisdiction over the LHC project. A subsequent appeal by the plaintiffs was dismissed by the Court on 24 August 2010.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, at {{a meeting}} of the Imperial Cricket Conference in London, cricket's [...] "throwing law" [...] was changed to forbid the {{straightening}} of the arm at the instant of the ball's delivery. The Australian Board of Control were so concerned about the controversy and its possible impact on the Australian game that they sent Board chairman Dowling and Board member Sir Donald Bradman to the meeting, rather than the customary Britain-based representative. Despite the agreed change in the law, because of conflicting interpretations in different countries a compromise was agreed, which specified an amnesty during the forthcoming 1961 Australian tour to England. It was agreed that on the tour, umpires would privately report <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> about bowling actions to the teams concerned, for them to remedy. After the tour, umpires would [...] "call" [...] bowlers whenever they felt the new law to have been breached.|$|E
500|$|In early {{seasons of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and {{occasionally}} for the damsel in distress plot device, {{which would require}} series' heroine Buffy to save her. <b>Any</b> <b>concerns</b> that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In {{an article about the}} psychology of characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Steven C. Schlozman writes about how [...] "Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander." [...] He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and [...] "all the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes." ...|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to <b>any</b> <b>concerns</b> raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
