5|$|The Belgo-Congolese {{situation}} remained difficult {{until early}} June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They {{then decided to}} try and sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, <b>another</b> <b>town</b> upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered {{by the arrival of}} a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} interrupted by an achilles injury for Brandon.

Brandon played in five games during his loan spell, all of which Blackpool won.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary {{publicly}} split, {{with the}} former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge {{and went on to}} form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced {{at the end of his}} visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit Samlout, <b>another</b> <b>town</b> located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.|$|E

5|$|Theodotus' {{success was}} not to be completed, however as in early summer 830, a fleet from the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in al-Andalus, under Asbagh ibn Wakil, arrived in Sicily despite the {{political}} difference and rivalry between Abbasid Caliphate and the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, the latter sent military assistance for Aghlabids to conquer Sicily although the Aghlabids was clearly serving under Abbasid interest. Ibn Kathir recorded that 300 ships of Umayyad and Aghlabids joint forces were present. Theodotus did not confront them, hoping that they would depart after raiding, but the beleaguered garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the raiders and proposed joint action. The Andalusians agreed, provided that Asbagh was recognized as the overall commander, and together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya marched on Mineo. Unable to confront them, Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken (July or August 830). The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to <b>another</b> <b>town,</b> possibly Calloniana (modern Barrafranca). However, once again a plague broke out in their camp, killing Asbagh and many others. The town fell later, in autumn, but the Arabs' numbers were so depleted that they had to abandon it and retreat west. Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties, so that most of the Andalusians departed the island. However, Theodotus too was killed at this time, possibly in one of these skirmishes.|$|E
