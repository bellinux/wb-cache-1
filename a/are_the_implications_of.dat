2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set.

50|$|The {{interaction}} between erosion and tectonics {{has been a}} topic of debate since the early 1990s. While the tectonic effects on surface processes such as erosion have long been recognized (for example, river formation {{as a result of}} tectonic uplift), the opposite (erosional effects on tectonic activity) has only recently been addressed. The primary questions surrounding this topic are what types of interactions exist between erosion and tectonics and what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> these interactions. While this is still a matter of debate, one thing is clear, the Earth's landscape is a product of two factors: tectonics, which can create topography and maintain relief through surface and rock uplift, and climate, which mediates the erosional processes that wear away upland areas over time. The interaction of these processes can form, modify, or destroy geomorphic features on the Earth’s surface.|$|E

As a result, both the velocity and the density of the interpenetrating plasma streams will <b>be</b> time dependent. <b>The</b> second issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear theory of the Weibel instability. For the experiments, <b>the</b> instability <b>is</b> in a regime where standard simplifications do not apply.

5000|$|The {{most common}} type of {{collaborative}} method of teaching in a class is classroom discussion. It is the also a democratic way of handling a class, where each student is given equal opportunity to interact and put forth their views. A discussion taking place in a classroom can be either facilitated by a teacher or by a student. A discussion could also follow a presentation or a demonstration. Class discussions can enhance student understanding, add context to academic content, broaden student perspectives, highlight opposing viewpoints, reinforce knowledge, build confidence, and support community in learning. The opportunities for meaningful and engaging in-class discussion may vary widely, depending on the subject matter and format of the course. Motivations for holding planned classroom discussion, however, remain consistent.An effective classroom discussion can be achieved by probing more questions among the students, paraphrasing the information received, using questions to develop critical thinking with questions like [...] "Can we take this one step further?;" [...] "What solutions do you think might solve this problem?;" [...] "How does this relate to what we have learned about..?;" [...] "What are the differences between ... ?;""How does this relate to your own experience?;" [...] "What do you think causes .... ?;" [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> .... ?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Andreas Engel {{has become}} known by {{his work on the}} {{so-called}} „binding problem“. His research focuses on the hypothesis that temporal synchrony serves for dynamic coordination of signals in the brain. In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications.As a postdoc with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research at Frankfurt, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.In addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling.In the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing, attention, working memory, decision-making [...] and consciousness.Recent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration. Furthermore, the group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation. Engel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action. A major focus of his work <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> the studies on neural synchrony for understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. Recent papers address links between neural dynamics and enactive views of cognition, investigating the grounding of cognition in sensorimotor coupling.|$|E
