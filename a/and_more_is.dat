5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|The {{adults are}} black with a silvery-gray coat on the thorax and abdomen. They are 6 to 7mm long, with clear wings and {{yellowish}} calypters. The knob of the haltere is yellow while the stalk is brownish yellow. The dorsal abdomen has a dark median stripe {{that produces a}} series of triangular markings with the segmentally arranged transverse bands. The thorax of the adult has three longitudinal stripes. They are darker than F. canicularis. The tibia on the mesothoraic leg has a distinct process, and the coxae have two setae at the apex. The fourth vein on the wing of this species is straight, as compared to it being curved in the house fly. There is a great variance between the sexes of this species, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> known about the male. For instance; their mid femur does not have blunt spines, the ventral tubercle of the mid tibia is indistinct, and the abdomen has no spots or stripes and is short and broad.|$|E

500|$|A common belief among {{fundamentalist}} Christianity is that Harry Potter {{promotes the}} religion of Wicca, and so keeping them in public schools violates {{the separation of church}} and state in the United States. In her response to Laura Mallory's court case, education attorney Victoria Sweeny said that if schools were to remove all books containing reference to witches, they would have to ban Macbeth and Cinderella. Jeremiah Films, a Christian video company largely known for its [...] Clinton Chronicles release, also released a DVD entitled Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged which stated that [...] "Harry's world says that drinking dead animal blood gives power, a satanic human sacrifice and Harry's powerful blood brings new life, demon possession is not spiritually dangerous, and that passing through fire, contacting the dead, and conversing with ghosts, others in the spirit world, <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>is</b> normal and acceptable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Cantú [...] {{suggests}} that apocalypse as revelation is the ideological construct that best explains the novel's structure and purpose. His reconstructive analysis shows how Antonio, as narrator, solves and resolves his troubling metaphysical questions {{through a series}} of revelations mediated by Ultima and her otherworldly connections. As more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> revealed to Tony, a transcendent reality is disclosed which is both temporal, insofar as it envisages eschatological salvation; and spatial, insofar as it involves another, supernatural world.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 2013, leftwing {{economist}} Michael Yates stated: [...] "What exasperates me more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> {{the certainty}} with which so many people pontificate [...] ". He argued the evidence for the tendency was tenuous, and that [...] "Marx analyzed capitalism in its [...] "ideal average," [...] {{at a high level}} of abstraction.

2500|$|The 19th century German Orthodox Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch {{read the}} word [...] "power" [...] ( [...] , koach) in [...] to {{comprehend}} everything {{that makes up}} one's creative personality and capacity to earn — intelligence, skill, foresight, health — and explained that this comes not from the food that one eats but directly from God. And the external circumstances that bring about success depend on God alone. Hirsch taught that the very smallest part of one's good fortune can be ascribed to one's own merit, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> due to the merit of one's ancestors, whose virtues God rewards with their descendants' good fortune.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Greece was {{strongly}} felt by post-Renaissance European elite, who {{saw themselves as}} the spiritual heirs of Greece. Will Durant wrote in 1939 that [...] "excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that {{does not come from}} Greece," [...] and conversely [...] "there is nothing in Greek civilization that doesn't illuminate our own". [...] Noted commentator Marianna de Marzi has also observed the extent to which Classical Greek thought has influenced the progression of Western civilization, writing: [...] "The profundity of the knowledge gained through this period in history; in art, mathematics, music <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>is</b> incomparable to almost any other chapter in human inquiry." ...|$|E

[...] Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain in his fingers during the 2007 tour. In {{an interview}} with Glide Magazine appearing in the May 2010 issue, Dweezil Zappa commented that Eddie had played him [...] "new stuff from his record."

60|$|The poem is dramatic, {{because it}} is acted and spoken or sung in {{character}} by its persons. It is allegorical, because it inculcates a moral, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>is</b> meant than meets the ear. In parts it is pastoral, both because the chief personage appears {{in the guise of}} a shepherd, and because its motive largely depends on the superstitions and traditions of simple, ignorant folk. In the longer speeches, where events are narrated with some fulness, it becomes epic. Lastly, in its songs, in the octosyllables of the magician, and in the adjuration and the thanking of Sabrina, it is lyric. With iambic pentameter as the basis of the dialogue, the poet varies his measures as Shakespeare does his, and with very similar ends in view.|$|E
6000|$|Swedish Peace, Queen Ulrique and the Anti-French Party {{now getting}} the upper hand, had been hastening {{forward in the}} interim (finished, at Hamburg, MAY 2d): a most small matter in {{comparison}} to the Russian; but welcome enough to Friedrich;--though he said slightingly of it, when first mentioned: [...] "Peace? I know not hardly of any War there has been with Sweden;--ask Colonel Belling about it!" [...] Colonel Belling, a most shining swift Hussar Colonel, who, with a 2,000 sharp fellows, hanging always on the Swedish flanks, sharp as lightning, [...] "nowhere and yet everywhere," [...] as was said of him, has mainly, for the last year or two, had the management of this extraordinary [...] "War." [...] Peace over all the North, Peace <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>is</b> now Friedrich's. Strangling imbroglio, wide as the world, has ebbed to man's height; dawn of day has ripened into sunrise for Friedrich; the way out is now a thing credible and visible to him.

Peter begs a Prussian Regiment,--dresses himself in its uniform, Colonel of ITZENPLITZ; Friedrich begs a Russian Regiment, Colonel of SCHUWALOF: and all is joyful, hopeful; marriage-bells instead of dirge ditto and gallows ditto,--unhappily not for very long.|$|E
