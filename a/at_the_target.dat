5|$|The {{engine and}} {{propeller}} had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with {{the horizon and}} aiming <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> with {{the sight of the}} fixed gun. The heavy bomb was swung down clear of the propeller on crutches prior to release.|$|E

5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares {{a number}} of {{maneuver}} strategies for five multi-planet missions, including the single planet strategy of nulling the aim-plane and flight-time errors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>target.</b> Significant differences were found among the strategies {{in the amount of}} corrective propellant required and <b>the</b> residual miss <b>at</b> each target. In general, nulling or minimization of <b>the</b> residual miss <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next <b>target</b> was found to be superior to that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>target,</b> when error growth is not nulled early. The best strategy corrects aim-plane and flight-time errors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next <b>target...</b>|$|R

5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|No 141 Squadron's Beaufighter Mk.IF's {{moved to}} Cornwall in February 1943 {{to carry out}} night patrols over Brittany and France and {{daylight}} patrols over the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Approaches to protect RAF Coastal Command aircraft. On 20 March 1943 he claimed a locomotive destroyed and soon afterwards was promoted to acting wing commander. In April Braham attacked a German E-Boat, firing 500 rounds of 20mm cannon <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> causing a large fire. On other operations Braham damaged three E-Boats while also strafing and damaging a U-Boat.|$|E

5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go, a lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Center were not resolved.|$|E

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, Apple Valley had a 50 record (including {{victories}} over state powerhouses DeLaSallewith a sidelined Reid Travisand Hopkins) and national rankings of 41 by USA Today and 16 by MaxPreps, while Whitney Young entered the game 11 with a 34 ranking.

5|$|While {{political}} maneuvering {{was continuing}} in Minnesota, by early April {{it was reported}} that Nashville had become the favored place for relocation over New Orleans. The Nashville offer became the preferred option as it included $80 million for the franchise from Gaylord Entertainment and an additional $20 million to be paid to the city of Minneapolis to pay down debt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Center. New Orleans later reemerged as the lead candidate for relocation by the end of April when Top Rank announced a purchase price of $152.5 million. By early May, the Minnesota state legislature approved a bill that would use public funds to purchase the Target Center for $48 million. The purchase by the state was contingent on ownership agreeing to keep the franchise in the arena for 30 years. However, ownership could not find a local suitor willing to pay what Top Rank had offered for the franchise setting the stage for relocation.|$|E

5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E

25|$|As the {{original}} {{requirement for the}} system was to provide additional information to optical instruments, accurate bearing measurements were not required.

For this role, the system used two receiver antennas mounted about one wavelength apart, so that when they were pointed directly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> the received signals would cancel out and produce a null on the display. This was sent to a second display, who's operator attempted to keep the antennas pointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe CRISPR-Cas 9 {{system has}} the {{potential}} to revolutionize genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), but its advantages and pitfalls are still poorly understood. We systematically tested the ability of CRISPR-Cas 9 to mediate reporter gene knockin at 16 distinct genomic sites in hPSCs. We observed efficient gene targeting but found that targeted clones carried an unexpectedly high frequency of insertion and deletion (indel) mutations at both alleles of <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> gene. These indels were induced by Cas 9 nuclease, as well as Cas 9 -D 10 A single or dual nickases, and often disrupted gene function. To overcome this problem, we designed strategies to physically destroy or separate CRISPR <b>target</b> sites <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> allele and developed a bioinformatic pipeline to identify and eliminate clones harboring deleterious indels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other allele. This two-pronged approach enables the reliable generation of knockin hPSC reporter cell lines free of unwanted mutations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> locus...|$|R
