5|$|That fall, CBS Reports, a news/documentary {{program at}} 7:30(et) on Wednesdays, was blamed {{in the press}} for the sharp drop off in the ratings of The Beverly Hillbillies– the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons, but dropped to eighteenth when CBS Reports became the Hillbillies lead-in for its third season. (Hillbillies had aired <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> before moving up a half hour in 1964.) CBS responded by moving CBS Reports to Mondays.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, {{students}} began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises {{in defiance of}} Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When {{a group of students}} sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.|$|E

On sailing day (10 April), Lowe assisted (among other things) in the lowering of two of the starboard lifeboats to satisfy the Board of Trade that the Titanic met safety regulations. When the Titanic departed Southampton at noon, Lowe was on the bridge, relaying messages to various parts of the ship by telephone.|$|E
25|$|A {{wall was}} soon erected around Ommen, {{including}} three gates: the Vechtpoort or Voorbruggenpoort (on {{the bank of}} the Vecht), the Varsenerpoort (on the western wall for traffic with Varsen) and the Arriërpoort (on the northern wall for traffic with Arriën). Even to this day, the two bells in the church's belltower, named Maria and Salvator and cast in 1517 by Hendrick de Tremonia of Dordrecht, are rung every evening <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock.</b> These so-called Ave-Maria peals form a custom which traces its origin to the tradition of ringing the bell at the closing of the gates. Ommen never received a moat, even though it was permitted one.|$|E

500|$|As teenagers, the Gallagher {{brothers}} maintained limited {{contact with}} their father {{in order to secure}} jobs in construction. However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said that [...] "because we were always arguing we'd still be working <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> every night". Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to British Gas. There he sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, Gallagher was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on Definitely Maybe in this storehouse (including [...] "Live Forever" [...] and [...] "Columbia"). He later called the storehouse [...] "The Hit Hut" [...] and claimed the walls were painted gold. Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time with recreational drug use, songwriting, and guitar playing. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.|$|E
500|$|On the {{day after}} the Double Tenth, internees were ordered to parade in the open <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> the next morning. No {{explanation}} was given. When the parade had assembled, the camp commandant came out with a number of Kempeitai and troops, who closed all the exits. While the names of a few men were called out for immediate arrest, the Kempeitai conducted a thorough search of the entire prison. After incriminating evidence including diaries of war news compiled from the BBC's radio broadcasts, self-made radios, and a tin box containing a substantial amount of money belonging to an ex-banker were unearthed, several more arrests were made, mostly of people who had been involved in monitoring news broadcasts and running a secret information service throughout the prison. This started a period of terror that lasted for several months. Suspects were hauled from their homes and places of work. Internees [...] were taken to the Kempeitai interrogation chambers, where they were subjected to torture and starvation to make them confess to acts of sabotage and treason. As none of the suspects had even heard of Operation Jaywick, let alone been part of it, any confessions they made were meaningless, lacking any information about the raid itself, how it had been organised, or where the explosives had been obtained.|$|E

500|$|No formal {{declaration}} of war was immediately made. French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met {{on the evening of}} 2 September. In fact, Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet, however, demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet's pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum (which had in fact not yet been served). Chamberlain's lengthy statement made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House of Commons received it badly. Greenwood rose to [...] "speak for the working classes". Conservative backbencher Leo Amery urged Greenwood to [...] "Speak for England, Arthur", implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so. Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success: too many members knew of Bonnet's efforts. National Labour MP and diarist Harold Nicolson later wrote, [...] "In those few minutes he flung away his reputation." [...] The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler. Chamberlain's last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> the following morning—to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon. At 11:15am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany: ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 August 1942, Ledbury sailed from Gibraltar, sighted {{the convoy}} in the afternoon, and took its convoy {{screening}} station. An hour before midnight on 10 August {{she left the}} convoy and proceeded to refuel from the tanker Dingledale, an operation that took place {{early in the morning}} of 11 August. Ledbury took aboard 101 tons of fuel. Just before ten o'clock in the morning, the destroyer took station as starboard wing ship of screen. In the afternoon, [...] was hit by torpedoes, with Derwent ordering Ledbury to stand by the stricken aircraft carrier. As Eagle sank, one destroyer and the tug Jaunty stopped, picking up survivors in the oil patches in the water. As Ledbury reached survivors, she was ordered to rejoin the convoy. The convoy now suffered a series of aerial attacks with the gunner of Ledburys port Oerlikon thought to have shot down one plane, although many other ships were firing at this machine. At 21:00, Ledbury was ordered to Anti-Aircraft station, with one cable on the starboard beam of No. 43. Early on the morning of 12 August, the destroyer was ordered by [...] to investigate a periscope reported on the starboard quarter of No.43. Nelson reported a submarine periscope bearing north of her, and Ledbury deployed single scare charges to cover [...] from this submarine, and destroyers astern of her appeared to follow up this contact. <b>At</b> <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, an air attack by Junkers 88s developed on the convoy, with one Junkers 88 crashing at bearing 058 degrees. Four small bombs were seen to go by the bridge, landing on the starboard side, and a large bomb came near the port quarter. In the ensuing mayhem, Ledbury was ordered to fill in gaps in the screen caused by ships falling back on contact. On the way to this position three airmen were seen coming down by parachute. One was picked up and found to be German, the others were abandoned. The captured airman stated that the last raid consisted of Luftwaffe airmen flying Junkers 88s from Sicily; and that he had been shot down by close range weapons from the convoy. Ledburys crew noted that the most interesting thing about the pilot was that the nails of his boots were made of wood. Yet another aerial attack ensued, this time by dive-bombers. Two groups approached from ahead, but neither got over the convoy. Two of these planes were shot down by gunfire. After this attack, the destroyer resumed station on the starboard side of the convoy. An attack by Junkers 88s soon started whilst escort fighters were still refuelling. Ledbury suffered another near miss off her port quarter. One ship in the convoy was damaged, and [...] stood by her.|$|E
