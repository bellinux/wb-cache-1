5|$|<b>All</b> <b>line</b> {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways' {{intercity}} services along the Sørland Line call at Nationaltheatret, {{up to four}} times per day per direction. The fastest service to Kristiansand takes 4 hours and 23 minutes and 7 hours and 59 minutes to Stavanger. NSB's regional service along the Vestfold Line also calls at Nationaltheatret, normally with a one-hour headway. Eastwards, these continue past OsloS and serve {{the southern part of}} the Dovre Line until Lillehammer. All eight lines of the Oslo Commuter Rail stop at Nationaltheatret. However, not all services of <b>all</b> <b>line</b> operate west of OsloS. The Airport Express Train operates direct, high-speed services to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen every 20 minutes, with the journey taking 28 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The hockey {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter edges {{are called the}} side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. <b>All</b> <b>line</b> markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E

If these constraints do not give a total ordering for <b>all</b> <b>lines,</b> then the lines that do not have an ordering with respect to each other are additions that conflict.|$|R
25|$|If Vect1(X) is {{considered}} as a group under the operation of tensor product, then the Stiefel–Whitney class is an isomorphism: w1 : Vect1(X) → H1(X; Z/2Z). That is, w1(λ ⊗ μ) = w1(λ) + w1(μ) for <b>all</b> <b>line</b> bundles λ, μ → X.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>line</b> graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs {{without an}} induced {{subgraph}} {{in the form}} of a three-leaf tree. As with claw-free graphs more generally, every connected line graph L(G) with an even number of edges has a perfect matching; equivalently, this means that if the underlying graph G has an even number of edges, its edges can be partitioned into two-edge paths.|$|E

Major cuts would have included <b>all</b> <b>lines</b> in Wales apart from the valley lines north of Cardiff; <b>all</b> <b>lines</b> in Devon and Cornwall other than the main line link to Exeter; the Salisbury-Exeter line; <b>all</b> <b>lines</b> in East Anglia other than the <b>line</b> to Norwich; <b>all</b> rural <b>lines</b> in Scotland; the trans-Pennine line; and most local lines east of the East Coast Main Line.

25|$|It {{may have}} been, but {{probably}} was not, limited to Kiritimati; while no remains have been found, little fieldwork {{has been conducted}} and judging from the Tuamotu sandpiper's habits, almost <b>all</b> <b>Line</b> Islands would have offered suitable habitat. The Kiritimati population of P. cancellata disappeared in the earlier part of the 19th century or so, almost certainly due to predation by introduced mammals. While Prosobonia generally manage to hold their own against Polynesian rats, they are highly vulnerable to the black rat and feral cats. Given the uncertainties surrounding the introduction date and maximum population of the former, the cats {{seem to be the}} main culprits in the Kiritimati sandpiper's extinction.|$|E
25|$|This edition's early {{popularity}} can in part {{be attributed}} to a concordance based on the second edition of the book by Bonifatius Fischer, which was a key reference tool before the availability of personal computers. More recently, it has become the text of the Vulgate most commonly disseminated on the Internet. This electronic version, however, is commonly mutilated, lacking all formatting, notes, prefaces and apparatus, and often lacking the Gallican Psalter and Apocrypha. Moreover, the protocanonical part of Daniel following chapter 3 is commonly missing. Because <b>all</b> <b>line</b> breaks have been removed from most online editions, this effectively removes all punctuation. Corrected digital versions of the text that additionally include the text's apparatus are available for purchase.|$|E

2500|$|A much cleaner {{approach}} to the computation of some cohomology groups is the Borel–Bott–Weil theorem, which identifies the cohomology groups of some line bundles on flag manifolds with irreducible representations of Lie groups.

2500|$|As with Lotto, players {{could also}} have their numbers {{selected}} for them by the machine by purchasing a Big Wednesday [...] "Dip". The Basic Big Wednesday Dip cost $6.00. Players could opt to select either heads, tails or random heads/tails. A popular option was a Big Wednesday Dip with both heads and tails, which produced two tickets with the same numbers, one ticket with [...] "heads" [...] on <b>all</b> <b>line</b> and one ticket with [...] "tails" [...] on all lines, which ensured that if the player matched all the numbers, they would win both First and Second Division.|$|E

2500|$|The Mchinji Mission Orphanage, {{popularly known}} as the [...] "Home of Hope", {{is one of the}} largest children's homes in Malawi. Reverend Thomson Chipeta, remembering losing both his parents, brought {{orphaned}} children into his home in 1992 and construction of an orphanage began in 1998. As of 2007, there are six large residential houses, a dining/assembly hall, a clinic, classrooms for nursery, primary and secondary classes, and staff housing. [...] "Baby David" [...] lived in the orphanage prior to being adopted by Madonna. The children are divided into different houses and each house has its own 'amayi'. An amayi acts as the house mother for the children. Each morning all the children must attend a daily devotion, in which there will be lots of singing and prayers. Following the devotion ceremony the children will <b>all</b> <b>line</b> up outside the 'kitchen' where they will get nsima for their breakfast. Nsima, maize and beans is typically what they will eat for every meal. Not all children living at the orphanage are 'orphans', many still have family however they are unable to provide basic necessities so they send them to Home of Hope. [...] During summer vacation and other holidays many of the children will return to their villages to spend time with their family.|$|E

Whatever {{there might have been}} of {{relationship}} or friendship between her and the dead man, the news of his terrible end left her shaken, indeed, but dry-eyed. She was apparently more terrified than grieved, and now that the first shock had passed away, her mind seemed occupied with thoughts which may indeed have had some connection with this tragedy, but were scarcely wholly concerned with it. She sat for a long while with her hands still resting upon the table but her eyes fixed out of the window. Then at last she rose and made her way outside. Her friend the reception clerk was engaged in conversation with one or two men, a conversation of which she was obviously the subject. As she opened the door, one of them broke off in the midst of what he was saying and would have accosted her. The clerk, however, interposed, and drew her a step or two back into the room.|$|E
