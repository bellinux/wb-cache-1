5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.|$|E

25|$|Other {{ways to get}} to Oregon were: {{using the}} York Factory Express route across Canada, and down the Columbia River; ships from Hawaii, San Francisco, or other ports that stopped in Oregon; emigrants {{trailing}} up from California, etc. All provided <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> emigrants, but they were soon overwhelmed in numbers by the emigrants coming over the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|The British Army {{evaluated}} the Mark E, but rejected it, apparently due {{to questions about}} {{the reliability of the}} suspension.

A Thai order was placed, but taken over by the British when the war started. Vickers built a total of 153 (the most common figure) Mark Es.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{as many as}} 40,000 Mizrahim {{still remain}} in {{communities}} scattered throughout the non-Arab Muslim world, primarily in Iran, but also Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. There are few Maghrebim remaining in the Arab world too. About 5,000 remain in Morocco and fewer than 2,000 in Tunisia. Other countries with remnants of ancient Jewish communities with official recognition, such as Lebanon, have 100 or fewer Jews. <b>A</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> emigration continues, mainly to Israel and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Mobile grew {{substantially}} {{in the period}} {{leading up to the}} Civil War, when the Confederates heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a blockade under the command of Admiral David Farragut. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} hoopla {{over the}} domestic violence and civil killings provoked a massive police operation in the city with 2000 policemen surrounded the Pacco Qillo locality. The huge army of peacemakers could not curb the riots {{and had to be}} called back. There was only <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> internal migrations before the operation, but the operation triggered a mass exodus of population. The Muhajir migrated en masse from Qasimabad and the interior of Sindh into Latifabad. Similarly, the Sindhis people moved to Qasimabad from Hyderabad and Latifabad.|$|E
25|$|July {{continued}} the same pattern: {{a number of}} AA rounds expended most nights, more fired in support of ground operations around Caen, and <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> casualties from occasional shellfire and bombs.

25|$|Due to {{the broken}} ground which slowed his progress, Arimondi {{completed}} his movement at 9:00 a.m. Almost immediately {{he came upon}} <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> wounded soldiers from Albertone's brigade, which {{had been forced to}} retreat on the nearby mount Semaiata. Within half an hour the trickle became a stream and Baratieri sent Albertone orders to retire and reform under Arimondi's cover. It was too late: the Colonial Brigade, out of ammunition, disintegrated shortly afterwards. At 10:00 a.m. the Ethiopian forces, mixed with the disbanded Italians, launched their first assault on Arimondi's position.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> {{immigration}} from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, {{in the form}} of escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the Fernandinos were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking {{on the eve of the}} First World War, and pidgin English was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labor supplies.|$|E
25|$|Though Thompson's {{books were}} {{falling out of}} print in the United States, the French had {{discovered}} his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> royalties flowing towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly {{in line with what}} writers of similar works received during that era. Rather, Thompson's drinking and general instability are what left him destitute.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, Thomas Gold {{proposed}} {{the theory that}} life first developed not {{on the surface of}} the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the sinking, engineers used ROVs to seal cracks in the tanker's hull, now 4000 meters below the sea surface, and slowed the leakage to <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> 20 litres a day. By 2004, engineers had removed the oil still in the tanker by drilling small holes in the wreck, using remotely operated submersible vehicles (ROVs) {{like the one that}} originally explored the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The oil was then pumped into large aluminium shuttles, specially manufactured for this salvage operation. The filled shuttles were then floated to the surface. The original plan to fill large bags with the oil proved to be too problematic and slow. After the oil removal was completed, a slurry rich in microbiologic agents was pumped in the hold to speed up the breakdown of any remaining oil. The total estimated cost of the operation was over €100 million.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these efforts, President Roosevelt {{directed}} that the Presidential Unit Citation be awarded to the India-China Wing. Hardin was given a month's leave in the United States, promoted to brigadier general, and as the representative of the wing received the award from General Arnold on 29 January 1944, the first ever awarded to a non-combat unit. Hardin returned to the India China Wing in February 1944, just as the first of <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports arrived in theater (see Operations on the low hump and in China below). With a maximum load ceiling of only 12,000 feet the C-54s were unable to hurdle the high Hump. Japanese interceptors blocked use of eastbound routes at lower altitudes and the C-54s were limited for the time being to freight movement within India or flights between the CBI and the continental United States.|$|E

25|$|From the 1780s, Māori {{encountered}} European and American sealers and whalers; some Māori crewed on {{the foreign}} ships, with many crewing on whaling and sealing ships that operated in New Zealand waters. Some of the South Island crews were almost totally Māori. Between 1800 and 1820, there were 65 sealing voyages and 106 whaling voyages to New Zealand, mainly from Britain and Australia. <b>A</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> escaped convicts from Australia and deserters from visiting ships, as well as early Christian missionaries, also exposed the indigenous population to outside influences. In the Boyd Massacre in 1809, Māori took hostage and killed 66 members of the crew and passengers in apparent revenge for the captain's whipping {{the son of a}} Māori chief. Given accounts of cannibalism in this attack, shipping companies and missionaries kept a distance and significantly reduced contact with the Māori for several years.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
25|$|Commodore had a {{reputation}} for announcing products that never appeared, so sought to quickly ship the C64. Production began in spring 1982 and volume shipments began in August. The C64 faced a wide range of competing home computers, but with a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors. In the United States the greatest competitors were the Atari 8-bit 400, the Atari 800, and the AppleII. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. The latest revision in the aging Apple II line, the Apple IIe, had higher-resolution graphics modes than the C64. Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an open architecture system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external ROM cartridge port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception. Initial C64 sales were nonetheless relatively slow {{due to a lack of}} software, reliability issues with early production models, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983 however, <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing, especially with price cuts from $600 to just $300.|$|E
