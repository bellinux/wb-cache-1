40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the use of diagnostic labels such as seizure, attack, fit and blackout by patients who experience seizures. While previous research on patients’ preferences for diagnostic terminology has relied on questionnaires, we assess patients’ own preferences and their responses to a doctor’s use of different labels through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of doctor-patient interactions in a realistic clinical setting. We also examine whether two subgroups of patients – those with epileptic seizures and those with (psychogenic) non-epileptic seizures – show different behaviours in this respect. Our findings suggest firstly that patients make fine lexical distinctions between the various diagnostic labels they use to describe their seizure experiences; secondly, that patients play {{an active role in the}} development and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>labels</b> for their medical complaint; and thirdly, that attention to patients’ lexical choices and interactive use or avoidance of labels can be relevant for the differential diagnosis of seizures...|$|E

We show that within the already existing frameworks, the case of bounded data structures with certain recoveries of exceptional values remains unsolved. First, we justify the usefulness of “labelling ” some terms in order to easily specify exceptions without inconsistency, and we then define a general framework <b>of</b> <b>label</b> algebras which allows us to “type ” terms instead of values. Exception algebras and exception specifications are defined as a direct <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>label</b> algebras.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new {{algebraic}} framework for exception handling which is {{powerful enough to}} cope with many exception handling features such as recovery, implicit propagation of exceptions, etc. This formalism treats all the exceptional cases; on the contrary, we show that within all the already existing frameworks, the case of bounded data structures with certain recoveries of exceptional values remained unsolved. We justify the usefulness of “labelling” some terms in order to easily specify exceptions without inconsistency. Surprisingly, there are several cases where even if two terms have the same value, {{one of them is}} a suitable instance of a variable in a formula while the other one is not. The main idea underlying our new framework <b>of</b> <b>label</b> algebras is that the semantics of algebraic specifications can be deeply improved when the satisfaction relation is defined via assignments with range in terms instead of values.

The “mixed diet” consisted of β-carotene-rich vegetables, and the “oil diet ” contained β-carotene-low vegetables with supplemental β-carotene. The <b>application</b> <b>of</b> extrinsically <b>labeled</b> β-carotene was also investigated. The bioaccessibility of β-carotene was 28 μg/ 100 μg β-carotene from the mixed diet and 53 μg/ 100 μg β-carotene from the oil diet. This ratio of 1. 9 : 1 was consistent with in vivo data, where the apparent absorption was 1. 9 -fold higher in the oil diet than in the mixed diet. The labeled β-carotene was not equally distributed over time. In conclusion, the food matrix effects on bioaccessibility of β-carotene could be measured using an in vitro model and were consistent with in vivo data.
