5|$|Defining {{levels of}} joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} in determining if children {{are engaging in}} age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|Dyadic joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> a conversation-like {{behavior}} that individuals engage in. This {{is especially true}} for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case of}} the adult, speech.|$|E
5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that joint <b>attention</b> skills <b>are</b> impaired {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, social preference, attention disengagement and intention understanding, assumed {{to be associated with}} the development of joint <b>attention,</b> <b>are</b> explored in relation to joint attention skills in children with ASD at the age of 36 months. Response to joint <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> related to intention understanding, whereas the number of joint <b>attention</b> initiations <b>was</b> associated with <b>attention</b> disengagement, and somewhat less stronger with social preference. The level on which children initiated joint <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> related to social preference. Possible interpretations of these findings are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Modern classicism {{showed a}} lesser {{interest}} in naturalism {{and a greater}} interest in formal stylization. Greater <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> paid to the rhythms of volumes and spaces—as well as greater attention to the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc.) while less <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume. Greater <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used.|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the scalp-recorded, auditory evoked potential to selective <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> examined while subjects responded to stimuli presented to one ear (focused attention) and to both ears (divided attention). The amplitude of the N 1 component {{was found to be}} largest to stimuli in the ear upon which <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> to be focused, smallest to stimuli in the ear to be ignored, and intermediate to stimuli in both ears when <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> divided. The results are interpreted as supporting a capacity model of attention...|$|R
5|$|Gaze following, or shared gaze, can {{be found}} in a number of primates. Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also {{demonstrate}} shared gaze. This type of joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{and parent}} {{chimpanzees}} show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner {{by looking at}} each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention. For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> deemed threatening.|$|E

His non-Stones projects, such as the X-Pensive Winos and {{recording}} with the Wingless Angels in Jamaica, as well as collaborations with Chuck Berry and Gram Parsons amongst others are covered in some detail.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of visual <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> studied using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to index stimulus processing as the locus of <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> shifted across the visual fields. Stimuli were flashed in random order {{to one of three}} locations: one in each of the lateral visual fields and one on the vertical meridian. Selective visual-spatial <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> manifested in the ERPs as an amplitude modulation of the sensory-evoked components over frontal, central, parietal, and occipital scalp areas. Attended stimuli also elicited broader negative components that appeared to be endogenous and could be dissociated from the amplitude enhancement of the earlier sensory-evoked components. A gradient of <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> evident in the progressive decline in amplitude of the sensory-evoked components of the ERPs to the lateral stimuli as <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> focused at increasing distances from the stim-ulus location. These results are discussed in tenns of "spotlight " and "gradient " models of the spatial allocation of visual attention...|$|R

5|$|Triadic joint <b>{{attention}}</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint <b>{{attention}}</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. <b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E

In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed.

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, {{they are able to}} enter into and direct another's attention.

The ability to engage in joint <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> crucial for language development.|$|E
40|$|Subjects were {{required}} to attend {{to a combination of}} stimulus modality (vision or audition) and location (left or right). Intermodal <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> measured by comparing event-related potentials (ERPs) to visual and auditory stimuli when the modality was relevant or irrelevant, while intramodal (spatial) <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> measured by comparing ERPs to visual and auditory stimuli presented at relevant and irrelevant spatial locations. Intramodal spatial <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> expressed differently in visual and auditory ERPs. When vision <b>was</b> relevant, spatial <b>attention</b> showed a contralateral enhancement of posterior N 1 and P 2 components and enhancement of parietal P 3. When audition <b>was</b> relevant, spatial <b>attention</b> showed a biphasic fronto-central negativity, starting after around 100 ms. The same effects were also present in ERPs to stimuli that were presented in the irrelevant modality. Thus, spatial <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> not completely modality specific. Intermodal <b>attention</b> effects <b>were</b> also expressed differently in vision and audition. Taken together, the obtained ERP patterns of the present study show that stimulus attributes such as modality and location are processed differently in vision and audition...|$|R

Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where full attention was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results were consistent with the PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with full attention.|$|E
