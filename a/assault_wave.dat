5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also {{began with a}} mortar attack, but the {{communist}} <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced to}} withdraw to the east. Three Americans were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had inserted a mortar team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had been effective in denying the subsequent use of the area to launch rocket attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial <b>assault</b> <b>wave,</b> Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
25|$|Following Iwo Jima, John Rodgers resumed duty {{with the}} fast carrier task force raiding Japan while {{awaiting}} {{the invasion of}} Okinawa, last and greatest amphibious operation of the Pacific war. John Rodgers operated with the carriers as they continued to bomb both Japan and Okinawa. She began screening operations as the first <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> hit the beach on 1 April. She stood by protecting the carriers and splashed two kamikazes as they dived toward the flattops. She remained in the area supporting operations until Okinawa was finally secure on 21 June.|$|E

25|$|On February 19, 1945, the 133rd Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) {{joined the}} Fifth Marine Amphibious Corps and the Fourth Marine Division for the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima. The entire force landed on Iwo Jima on D-Day {{with the first}} <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> led by the Fourth Marine Division. The 133rd NCHB {{suffered}} severe casualties during the fight for Iwo Jima, where it distinguished itself in both front-line combat and construction. The 133rd NCHC had 370 casualties, more than 40 percent of the 875 men that landed, the highest casualties {{as part of a}} single battle in Seabee history.|$|E
25|$|After landing {{with the}} first <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> in Fedala, Wilbur {{approached}} the French lines under a white flag of truce and was escorted to their division headquarters. Finding that his intermediate contact there {{had been arrested for}} treason, he attempted to give the letter to the presiding general. The general refused to accept it, so Wilbur placed the letter on the man's desk and left. Before reaching his vehicle, he was stopped by another officer who offered to take him to Admiral Michelier. Upon arriving at the admiral's headquarters, he was turned away; Michelier refused to meet with him. Wilbur headed back to the American lines in Fedala.|$|E
25|$|For {{the battles}} of Mersa Matruh and Alamein {{and for the}} {{remainder}} of the North African Campaign, the division operated with just its two surviving field companies (233 and 505). In April 1943, in preparation for the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), 50 Division was joined by 168 (London) Infantry Brigade (consisting of 1st London Scottish, 1st London Irish Rifles and 10th Royal Berkshire Regiment) from 56th (London) Infantry Division, which brought 501 Field Company with it. The 50th Infantry Division was in the first <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> and then fought its way up the east side of the island, including the Battle of Primosole Bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Returning to Manus, Admiralty Islands, Barnstable loaded {{troops and}} cargo and arrived in Leyte Gulf 20 October 1944.

50|$|Next came Bataan and Corregidor, {{taken from}} 13-28 February 1945. Phoenix covered {{minesweeping}} operations at Balikpapan, Borneo, from 29 June to 7 July. Resistance from coastal guns was unusually heavy. Mines and shellfire sank or damaged 11 minesweepers. Phoenix furnished supporting {{fire and the}} <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> landed.|$|R
50|$|At 02:46 on 10 July {{the first}} <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> hit the Gela beaches. Plunging {{in through the}} breakers, the shock troops {{encountered}} light opposition. But furious gunfire raked the follow-up waves. Caught in the blue-white glare of searchlights, landing craft were subjected to intense fire, and LCIs took direct hits.|$|R
25|$|A total 3,795 men {{landed in}} the <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> with the {{remainder}} of the Allied force landing in four waves during the following 20 days, to reach a total of 6,574 men. The operation was the first amphibious assault launched by New Zealand troops since the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915. It was the second combat operation undertaken by the New Zealanders in the Pacific, following the Land Battle of Vella Lavella, which had taken place the previous month. The New Zealand infantry were supported by US combat support and service support units including a naval construction battalion (the 87th), a signals unit, a naval base unit, and a coastal artillery battalion (the 198th) to provide anti-aircraft fire support.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 23 January 1968, the PAVN 24th Regiment struck the {{defenders}} of Ban Houei Sane from three directions. Initially the assault was spearheaded by the 3/24 Battalion with the 198th Armoured Battalion in support, but the first <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> was delayed for various reasons. Firstly PAVN infantry and armoured corps lacked the experience in combined operations, secondly the local terrain posed many difficulties for the tank crews, causing the PT-76 light tanks to bog down attempting to cross a stream. By 06:00 Colonel Lê Công Phê ordered his troops to advance on Ban Houei Sane despite the delays of the 198th Armoured Battalion. As PAVN units moved towards the Laotian outpost, the PT-76's of the 198th Battalion turned up causing much confusion among the defenders.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the naval}} {{support for the}} LCAs {{approaching}} Bark South were LCS(M)s to provide supporting fire during their approach to the beaches. The naval plan worked adequately, with few exceptions, {{and there was no}} enemy air or sea interdiction. The Mediterranean was rough, however, and most of troops travelling in LCAs suffered sea-sickness, one man so much so that he died. Some worry plagued planners regarding LCAs swamping in the heavy surf at the shoreline, but the crews touched down and retracted their craft without serious difficulty. Anxious minutes passed at the Red and Green waiting positions, as by zero hour, when the <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> of LCAs had beached, many of the LCIs and most of the LCTs had not arrived. This was largely due to the rough sea which, though inconvenient for landing ships carrying LCAs, had considerably reduced the distances landing craft could cover.|$|E
50|$|On 20 February she got {{underway}} for Leyte Island, whence she {{proceeded to}} Ilo Ilo, Panay, to support MTB Ron 33 during the assault {{there and to}} establish a patrol base after its success. The <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> met no apparent opposition, the enemy having set fires and demolition charges and evacuated the city.|$|R
50|$|Attacks {{were carried}} out in several manners, {{including}} single or double rank battle lines with individual regiments side-by-side {{in a line of}} battle, <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> (with multiple regiments or brigades in successive waves spaced out loosely one behind the other), brigade columns (all regiments of a brigade in line one behind the other in close formation), and other formations.|$|R
50|$|When the Allies invaded Normandy on D-Day, Royal Air Force Airfield Construction Service {{engineers}} {{were among those}} in the initial <b>assault</b> <b>waves.</b> Their mission was to rapidly construct forward operating airfields, known as Advanced Landing Grounds (ALGs), on the European continent. As the Allied armies advanced across France and into Germany, several hundred airfields were built or rehabilitated {{for use by the}} allied air forces.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of an immediate Japanese counterattack by air units, the assault was planned to ensure a smooth landing, that would allow the transports to withdraw quickly. Some difficulty was experienced in landing east of the cape, while the three northern beaches were found to be completely unsuitable for landing craft to get ashore. Nevertheless, the initial <b>assault</b> <b>wave,</b> which consisted of 7,500 Marines, proceeded relatively smoothly and landed successfully by 07:30 hours. These troops pushed ashore through small dry corridors of land and began clearing defenders from the dense scrub. The 2nd Marine Raider Battalion used search dogs to locate Japanese troops hiding in the undergrowth, and by 11:00 hours, the Marines had seized the lightly defended area. Some resistance continued until nightfall, by which time the beachhead was firmly secured, coming at a cost of 78 killed in action while virtually annihilating the 270 troops of the Japanese that were defending the area around the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|The LCAs for {{the initial}} <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> were {{scheduled}} to touch down at 02:45, which they managed, {{and in most cases}} at the correct beaches. At approximately 03:15, LCIs and LCTs moving the reserve companies and assaulting battalion's headquarters were to touch down. Unfortunately, this wave was not so successful; a number of craft initially failed to locate their designated beaches, and, arriving 30 to 60 minutes late, delayed the division's movement inland. Soon after, at 03:45, the LCIs and LCTs of the brigade reserve follow-up flight were to be {{in the vicinity of the}} beaches ready to beach when opportunity afforded. All craft were to be beached by first light (04:39) or be in an unsinkable position by that time. To enable loading to be carried out after sunrise, 05:47, arrangements were made for ample smoke canisters to be carried in all craft, so that the area of the landing beaches could be adequately smoked should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|At 04:30 on 3 September, {{approximately}} an {{hour before}} first light, LCAs carrying British 5th Division and Canadian 1st Division troops of the 13th Corps, Eighth Army, touched down after crossing the Strait of Messina into Calabria. This was a shore to shore landing craft operation with the assault forces embarking at Mili Marina, south of Messina, and travelling an average of 12,000 yards to their assault beaches. The LCAs and LCMs that comprised the initial <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> were joined by DUKWs and LCI(L)s in later waves. The flotillas were led in by Motor Launches, and guided by directional tracer from Bofors guns along with four vertical searchlight beams to allow coxswains to keep their bearings. Still, navigation proved difficult. The rapid and irregular currents, whirlpools, and winds of the Messina Strait hampered navigation. Though the night was starlit, with no moon, the prodigious artillery barrage accompanying the assault contained {{a high number of}} smoke rounds (500). The navigation lights of the guiding Motor Launches, which LCA coxswains were to follow, became lost among the lights on the opposing shore.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the {{untested}} 29th Infantry Division, {{along with}} nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc, were to assault the western {{half of the}} beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial <b>assault</b> <b>waves,</b> consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing {{the need}} for a beach {{reconnaissance}} force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at Amphibious Training Base Little Creek, Virginia on August 15, 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> to the landing beach.|$|R

500|$|On February 19, Sergeant Cole led {{his machine}} gun section ashore in the D-Day assault of Iwo Jima. Moving {{forward with the}} initial <b>assault</b> <b>wave,</b> a hail of fire from two enemy emplacements halted his section's advance. Sergeant Cole {{personally}} destroyed them with hand grenades. His unit continued to advance until pinned down {{for a second time}} by enemy fire from three Japanese gun emplacements. One of these emplacements was destroyed by a machine-gunner in Cole's squad. When his machine guns jammed, armed only with a pistol and one hand grenade, Sergeant Cole made a one-man attack against the two remaining gun emplacements. Twice he returned to his own lines for additional grenades and continued the attack under fierce enemy fire until he had succeeded in destroying the enemy strong points.|$|E
500|$|The Viet Minh {{launched}} a massed assault against the exhausted defenders {{on the night}} of 1 May, overrunning [...] "Eliane 1", [...] "Dominique 3", and [...] "Huguette 5", although the French managed to beat back attacks on [...] "Eliane 2". On 6 May, the Viet Minh {{launched a}}nother massed attack against [...] "Eliane 2". The attack included, for the first time, Katyusha rockets. The French artillery fired a [...] "TOT" [...] (Time On Target) attack, so artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time. This barrage defeated the first <b>assault</b> <b>wave.</b> A few hours later that night, the Viet Minh detonated a mine shaft, blowing [...] "Eliane 2" [...] up. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours then had overrun the defenders.|$|E
50|$|On 12 August 1941, the organization's {{designation}} {{was changed}} to the 141st Armored Signal Company.

25|$|For the Normandy landings, 80th AA Bde was {{assigned}} to support I Corps landing on Juno and Sword. The leading elements were to land with the <b>assault</b> <b>waves</b> on D-Day itself (6 June). Light AA defence was emphasised {{at the start of}} the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat and the designated assault regiments landed with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties arriving later.|$|R
500|$|Two {{companies}} of the Liverpool Irish {{landed in the}} <b>assault</b> <b>wave</b> with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison's [...] "A" [...] Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in [...] "B" [...] Company's sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and DD tanks exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company's officer commanding, Major O'Brien, and the second-in-command were among those wounded. At Sword, as the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King's attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in {{an attack on a}} German position that captured 16 soldiers.|$|E
500|$|In early May, the 11th Battalion {{moved to}} Norieul, where they {{occupied}} a recently captured {{portion of the}} German line. A couple of days later, during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, their position was attacked by German [...] "shock troops". In response to the attack, supporting artillery was called down, and the attack repulsed. The Germans laid down a heavy bombardment in retaliation. An attack was ordered, but the order was rescinded when the senior officer in the forward trench, Major Aubrey Darnell, expressed concerns {{about the state of}} the soldiers in the <b>assault</b> <b>wave.</b> The Germans then put in another attack, which was once again turned back, before the 11th launched a limited counterattack and regained the ground that had been lost. The battalion, having lost 68 men killed, two captured and 140 wounded, was down to a strength of just over 400 men. They were relieved and then moved back to Bapaume, where they received a draft of over 100 reinforcements.|$|E
500|$|Krrizian {{joined the}} Marine Corps on February 23, 1944.
