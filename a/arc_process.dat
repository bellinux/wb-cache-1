25|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Haber process for the production of ammonia in 1913, nitric acid was produced using the Birkeland–Eyde process, also known as the <b>arc</b> <b>process.</b> This process is based upon the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen by atmospheric oxygen to nitric oxide at very high temperatures. An electric arc was used to provide the high temperatures, and yields of up to 4% nitric oxide were obtained. The nitric oxide was cooled and oxidized by the remaining atmospheric oxygen to nitrogen dioxide, and this was subsequently absorbed in dilute nitric acid. The process was very energy intensive and was rapidly displaced by the Ostwald process once cheap ammonia became available.|$|E

5000|$|Electroslag welding (ESW) is {{a highly}} productive, single pass welding process for thick (greater than 25 mm up to about 300 mm) {{materials}} in a vertical or close to vertical position. (ESW) is similar to electrogas welding, but the main difference is the arc starts in a different location. An electric arc is initially struck by wire that is fed into the desired weld location and then flux is added. Additional flux is added until the molten slag, reaching {{the tip of the}} electrode, extinguishes the arc. The wire is then continually fed through a consumable guide tube (can oscillate if desired) into the surfaces of the metal workpieces and the filler metal are then melted using the electrical resistance of the molten slag to cause [...] The wire and tube then move up along the workpiece while a copper retaining shoe that was put into place before starting (can be water-cooled if desired) is used to keep the weld between the plates that are being welded. Electroslag welding is used mainly to join low carbon steel plates and/or sections that are very thick. It can also be used on structural steel if certain precautions are observed. This process uses a direct current (DC) voltage usually ranging from about 600 A and 40-50 V, higher currents are needed for thicker materials.

Advanced welding processes utilize real-time control and prediction, increasing the need for detailed knowledge of arc characteristics and arc applications. This paper analyses the types of welding arcs used in the welding industry, explains corresponding features and characteristics, provides guidance for suitable applications, and presents arc type comparisons, benefits, and weaknesses. The study is based on a review of the literature, and it provides a comprehensive overview of arc phenomena. The results of this work show that in many applications, greater benefit accrues from spray and pulsed arcs than short and globular arc modes. Controlled short arc, heavy deposition rate arc, and controlled spray arc are enhanced <b>arc</b> <b>processes</b> offering significant improvements in efficiency and usability.
