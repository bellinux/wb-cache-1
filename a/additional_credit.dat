25|$|In Australia, {{credit scoring}} is widely {{accepted}} {{as the primary}} method of assessing creditworthiness.

The cast included Denis Quilley as Candide, Mary Costa as Cunegonde, Laurence Naismith as Dr. Pangloss and Edith Coates as the Old Lady. The Musical Director was Alexander Faris. It ran for 60 performances.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{internal}} and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed personal charges {{on a pair of}} MARTA credit cards used by former General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries. Ford's charges included $454 at a golf pro shop, $335 in clothing from Men's Wearhouse and a $58 visit to the dentist. In response to the 2006 audit, Ford sent MARTA a check for $1,000 as reimbursement for the charges. An <b>additional</b> <b>credit</b> card with charges involving two of his secretaries, Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart, was also uncovered. Smart used the cards to pay approximately $6,000 in private expenses, and subsequently agreed to repay this amount to MARTA.|$|E
25|$|The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station which {{replaced}} the older ticketing machines, allow commuters to purchase <b>additional</b> <b>credit</b> {{to add to}} their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single trip tickets are higher than those for EZ-Link cards. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine {{so as long as}} the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be deposited into a charity collection box, with the S$1 deposit going to charity. The rationale behind such a refundable deposit feature was that the smartcard technology contained within each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate the recycling of Standard Tickets. Since November 2007, external readers were installed on GTMs at stations operated by SMRT Corporation to address problems of card jamming in insert slots. The slots, however, remain in use for the purpose of refunding Standard Ticket deposits.|$|E

500|$|When Anderson first {{wrote the}} episode, {{she did not}} hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me, away from Washington, to somehow tie into {{what it was that}} I was going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated much of her time researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave <b>additional</b> <b>credit</b> to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E

2500|$|Economically, the Soviet Union made {{repeated}} {{efforts to}} reestablish closer contacts with Germany in the mid-1930s. The Soviet Union chiefly sought to repay debts from earlier trade with raw materials, while Germany sought to rearm. The two countries signed a credit agreement in 1935. By 1936, crises {{in the supply}} of raw materials and foodstuffs forced Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament [...] "without regard to costs".

The main obstacle to an understanding with Moscow is Hitler himself." [...] Stalin did not agree, responding to the NKVD [...] "Well, now, how can Hitler make war on us when he has granted such loans? [...] It's impossible.

2500|$|Despite the {{political}} rhetoric, in 1936, the Soviets attempted to seek closer political ties to Germany {{along with an}} <b>additional</b> <b>credit</b> agreement, while Hitler rebuffed the advances, not wanting to seek closer political ties, [...] even though a 1936 raw material crisis prompted Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament [...] "without regard to costs." [...] In the 1930s, thanks to two dishonest British Foreign Office ciper clerks, namely Ernest Holloway Oldham and John Herbert King, who sold the British diplomatic codes to the NKVD, the Soviets were able to read British diplomatic traffic. At the same time, the Soviet code-breakers were completely unable to break the German codes encrypted by the Enigma machine. The fact that Soviet intelligence-gathering activities in Germany were performed through the underground German Communist Party, which was full of Gestapo informers, rendered most Soviet espionage in Germany ineffective. Stalin's decision to execute or imprison most of the German Communist emigres living in the Soviet Union during the Great Terror finished off almost all Soviet espionage in the Reich.|$|E

2500|$|On July 7, 2011, {{sentencing}} {{arguments were}} heard. The defense {{asked for the}} sentencing {{to be based on}} one count of lying {{on the grounds that the}} offenses occurred as part of a single interview with police dealing with the same matter, the disappearance of her daughter, as one continuous lie. The defense also argued for concurrent sentences, that is for all four counts to become one count and the sentence to run together as one. The judge disagreed with defense arguments, finding that Anthony's statements consisted of [...] "four distinct, separate lies" [...] ordered the sentences be served consecutively, noting that [...] "Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy and manpower looking for Caylee Marie Anthony. This search went on from July through December, over several months, trying to find Caylee Marie Anthony." [...] Judge Perry sentenced Anthony to one year in the county jail and $1,000 in fines for each of the four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer, the maximum penalty prescribed by law. She received 1043 days credit for time served plus <b>additional</b> <b>credit</b> for good behavior, resulting in her release on July17, 2011. Anthony filed a notice of appeal on July 15, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Grey-Summers is {{a central}} {{character}} in the mid-1990s X-Men animated television series, voiced by Catherine Disher. As in the comics, {{she was in a}} relationship with Cyclops, eventually marrying Cyclops while being the target of Wolverine's unrequited affection. For the most part, she was a warm, friendly person who when necessary stepped in and played peace maker between Cyclops and Wolverine. As far as her relationship with Cyclops was concerned, they were very happy and content with each other, in stark contrast to Gambit and Rogue often fighting and bickering. The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold and adapted in season three, subdivided into the five-part [...] "Phoenix Saga" [...] in which Jean acquires the power of the Phoenix and the battle for the M'Kraan Crystal occurs, and the [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga", showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club, the Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix (voiced by Tracey Moore), and the battle to decide her fate.
