5|$|In 1868, the chancel {{and north}} <b>aisle</b> walls were rebuilt, a porch was added {{on the south}} side and a vestry added on the north side in place of one within the north <b>aisle</b> that Thomas Jones had created in 1840. The work was carried out by Henry Kennedy, the {{architect}} of the Diocese of Bangor.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of the church is the first major {{addition}} to the church: Lane's <b>Aisle.</b> This was built 1526–1529 by a local cloth merchant, John Lane (d.1529). It is fan vaulted in a style inspired by the Dorset <b>aisle</b> at Ottery St Mary and some of the carvings are similar to John Greenway's Chapel at Tiverton. John Lane and wife are buried at the east end of the <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel in {{the south}} <b>aisle</b> and St Thomas' Chapel in the north <b>aisle</b> were {{dedicated}} to St Mary and St Thomas of Canterbury respectively. They fell into disuse in the Reformation, but were restored in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|In {{supermarkets}} {{there are}} two types of <b>aisles,</b> food <b>aisles</b> and checkout <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Aisles</b> {{can also}} be seen in shops, warehouses, and factories, where rather than seats, they have {{shelving}} to either side. In warehouses and factories, <b>aisles</b> may consist of storage pallets, and in factories, <b>aisles</b> may separate work areas. In health clubs, exercise equipment is normally arranged in <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{stated in}} GR-3028, most {{equipment}} environments maintain cool front (maintenance) <b>aisles</b> and hot rear (wiring) <b>aisles,</b> where cool supply air is {{delivered to the}} front <b>aisles</b> and hot air {{is removed from the}} rear <b>aisles.</b> This scheme provides multiple benefits, including effective equipment cooling and high thermal efficiency.|$|R
5|$|The {{aisles of}} the choir {{previously}} both extended {{on either side of}} the Lady Chapel. The south <b>aisle</b> was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of StErasmus. The eastern end of the north <b>aisle</b> contains the chapel of St Werburgh.|$|E
5|$|The north choir <b>aisle</b> has a stone screen by R.C.Hussey and an {{iron gate}} dated 1558 {{that came from}} Guadalajara. At {{the east end of}} the <b>aisle</b> is the chapel of St Werburgh which has a vault of two bays, and an east window {{depicting}} the Nativity by Michael O'Connor, dated 1857. Other stained glass windows in the north <b>aisle</b> are by William Wailes, by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. The chapel contains a piscina dating from the 14thcentury, and monuments to Bishop Graham dated 1867, and to William Bispham who died in 1685, Other monuments in the north <b>aisle</b> include a tablet to Bishop Jacobson, dated 1887, by Boehm to a design by Blomfield.|$|E
5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} <b>aisle.</b> During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and the window at the east end of the north <b>aisle</b> from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south <b>aisle</b> from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south <b>aisle</b> are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north <b>aisle</b> is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} pseudo-basilican in style; the <b>aisles</b> {{are almost as}} wide as the nave, the three <b>aisles</b> each have their own vault and the nave rises above the <b>aisles,</b> {{although}} a clerestory is missing.|$|R

50|$|The nave is {{generally}} flanked {{on either side}} by <b>aisles,</b> usually single, but sometimes double. The nave {{is generally}} considerably taller than the <b>aisles,</b> having clerestory windows which light the central space. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like St. Stephen of Vienna, often have nave and <b>aisles</b> of similar height and are called Hallenkirche. In the South of France {{there is often a}} single wide nave and no <b>aisles,</b> as at Sainte-Marie in Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges.|$|R
5|$|A {{transverse}} <b>aisle</b> paralleled the qibla wall, {{with nine}} aisles {{at right angles}} to the transverse.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir <b>aisle</b> (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south <b>aisle</b> of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed <b>aisle</b> between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north <b>aisle</b> was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection. At this time, the south <b>aisle,</b> nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is on the}} Latin cross plan, with a four-bay nave and two <b>aisles.</b> The transept {{is divided into two}} <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The skillion-roofed <b>aisles</b> {{also have}} raked clear {{finished}} timber boarded ceilings supported by exposed timber trusses. Narrow round arched windows illuminate the <b>aisles</b> {{and a set}} of timber doors with fanlight over open to the exterior. Shrines dedicated to Jesus and Mary are located at the southeast ends of the <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The five {{sections}} of the eastern façade of the Stockholm Cathedral reflects the three original, medieval nave and <b>aisles</b> and the flanking two <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south <b>aisle</b> of the cathedral, {{resulting in the}} roof of the nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north <b>aisle.</b> In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south <b>aisle</b> {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the <b>aisle,</b> is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an <b>aisle</b> gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses which prevent passengers from having {{direct contact with}} the driver when the bus is in motion, even if the <b>aisle</b> gate is forced open.|$|E
50|$|The {{north and}} south <b>aisles,</b> are both of three bays; both the <b>aisles</b> and the south chapel are {{supported}} by two-stage buttresses between each window.|$|R

5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or <b>aisle.</b> As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger {{is no more than}} one seat from the <b>aisle.</b> It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Peter was {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house {{was built in the}} late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south <b>aisle,</b> chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west. In the south <b>aisle</b> are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century. The font is Norman while the pulpit is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar triptych.|$|E
