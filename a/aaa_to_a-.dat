40|$|WOS: 000295167200002 International audienceProcessing of odor {{mixtures}} by neonates is weakly understood. Previous {{studies showed}} that a binary mixture of ethyl isobutyrate/ethyl maltol (odorants A/B) blends in newborn rabbits at the 30 / 70 ratio: Pups would perceive a configural odor {{in addition to the}} components' odors. Here, we investigated whether the emergence of this additional odor in AB is determined by specific ratio(s) of A and B. To that goal, we tested whether pups discriminated between AB mixtures with lower (A(-) B, 8 / 92 ratio) or higher (A(+) B, 68 / 32) proportion of A. In Experiment 1, pups conditioned to A (or B) responded <b>to</b> <b>A(-)</b> B and A(+) B but not to AB. In Experiment 2, pups responded <b>to</b> <b>A(-)</b> B after learning of <b>A(-)</b> (and <b>to</b> A(+) B after learning of A(+)) but not to AB. In Experiment 3, after conditioning <b>to</b> <b>A(-)</b> B pups responded <b>to</b> <b>A(-)</b> and B (and to A(+) and B after learning of A(+) B) but not or less to AB. In Experiment 4, pups responded <b>to</b> <b>A(-)</b> B and A(+) B after conditioning to AB. These results confirm the configural perception of certain odor mixtures by young organisms and reveal that the proportion of components is a key factor influencing their coding, recognition, and discrimination of complex stimuli...|$|R
