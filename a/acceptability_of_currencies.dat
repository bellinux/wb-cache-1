40|$|Many cases exist <b>of</b> {{multiple}} <b>currency</b> usage throughout history. As {{two leading}} examples, secondary currencies were widespread during both the Great Depression in the United States and the 2002 recession in Argentina. What are the determinants <b>of</b> multiple <b>currency</b> usage {{and what is}} the effect on economic activity? Both issues are empirically addressed using individual-level surveys collected by the authors in Argentina during 2002 and 2003. The evidence supports the theoretically predicted determinants <b>of</b> secondary <b>currency</b> <b>acceptability</b> put forth in monetary theory. In particular, findings show that the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the secondary <b>currency</b> increases when the supply <b>of</b> national <b>currency</b> is low, the relative transaction cost <b>of</b> the secondary <b>currency</b> is low, and the individual trading technologies are less effective. Moreover the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the secondary <b>currency</b> has real effects on economic activity. Among those who use the secondary currency the monthly income gain is more than 15 % of the average Argentine's monthly income. Excluding trades of used goods, this amounts to a 0. 6 % increase in GDP. Secondary currency Monetary theory Exchange clubs Argentina Propensity score...|$|R

METHODS: During September-October 1997, 13 studies located in West (Abidjan, Bobo Dioulasso), East (Nairobi, Mombasa, Dar Es Salaam, Blantyre, Lusaka, Harare) and South Africa (Soweto, Durban), and Thailand (Bangkok) were included in a cross-sectional mailing survey about the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> VCT in antenatal clinics. Acceptance rate, return rate, overall <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> VCT (acceptance of both pre- and post-VCT sessions) were obtained using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The median overall <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> VCT was 69 % (range, 33 - 95 %). Overall <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> VCT most frequently depended on return rates because acceptance rates were generally high. Where several studies were conducted in parallel in the same city or the same country, overall <b>acceptability</b> rates <b>of</b> HIV testing were generally comparable even if the intervention programmes differed. Overall <b>acceptability</b> rates <b>of</b> VCT were high in antenatal clinics where a particular effort in implementing VCT programmes had been made.

Mothers of children with ASD aged 3 – 9 years (N = 139) completed survey measures that assessed demographics, parental attributions, treatment <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> parent-focused and child-focused behavioural interventions, severity of their child's disruptive behaviour, and severity of their child's ASD symptoms. The results showed that parental attributions of parent-referent stability, but not the other attributional dimensions, negatively predicted treatment <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> a parent-focused behavioural intervention, even when severity of disruptive behaviour was statistically controlled. Conversely, no associations were found between any attributional dimension and treatment <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> a child-focused behavioural intervention.

The results further show that the evidential support relation is crucial in differentiating between the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> an indicative conditional and the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding concessive conditional: typically, the use of a concessive conditional signals that the corresponding conditional probability is high {{in spite of the fact}} that the antecedent is evidence against the consequent, or in any case is not evidence for the consequent...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable energy {{transitions}} will be hampered without sufficient public support. Hence, it {{is important}} to understand what drives public <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> (sustainable) energy alternatives. Evaluations of specific costs, including risks, and benefits of different energy alternatives have been linked to <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> these alternatives. But how do people come up with these evaluations, and which evaluations are the key drivers <b>of</b> <b>acceptability?</b> In this review, we propose a comprehensive conceptual framework in which we integrate two growing but so far unconnected bodies of research on how objective characteristics of energy alternatives (i. e., contextual factors), on one hand, and, on the other hand, general psychological factors shape evaluations and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> energy alternatives. Importantly, we identify general factors, particularly values, that may influence evaluations and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> many different energy alternatives on a general as well as community level. We put forward a research agenda with two major themes. First, we lay out possibilities to strengthen the current knowledge basis for a conceptual framework that explains evaluations and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> energy alternatives. Second, we suggest how the framework could be extended to explain evaluations and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> energy alternatives in a more comprehensive and accurate way. Based on the knowledge developed, we discuss policy implications, some of which have not been put forward yet and hence propose new possibilities for interventions aimed at enhancing sustainable energy transitions.

40|$|Stakeholder {{participation}} in modeling studies is often advocated {{as a means}} to enhance the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> these studies. In turn, <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> modeling studies is considered as an important factor stimulating their actual use in policy making. Although these hypotheses are generally accepted, to date little empirical evidence is available to support or reject them. This study aims at exploring in more detail whether or not stakeholder {{participation in}}creases <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> modeling studies and the use of their results in policy making, and how that can be understood. For this purpose thirteen projects were analyzed. Methods employed included a review of project reports and further papers on the project, as well as standardized surveys with scientists involved in the cases and open oral interviews with other key figures. A majority of the projects concerned European cases in which land use and exploitation of water resources had to be planned in combination. Our results suggest that <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> modeling studies is correlated to the actual use of these studies, although {{it does not seem to}} be a prerequisite. In turn, <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> modeling studies is positively correlated to a participatory approach. The latter is also correlated to the extent to which policy-oriented learning took place during modeling studies. In addition our study shows that stakeholder participation enhances <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the models by allowing stakeholders to contribute ideas, knowledge, and priorities. Also communication of studies and their results to stakeholders is important for the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> models. Finally, applicability of models seems to be a prerequisite for their acceptability. No evidence was found <b>of</b> the <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> models being positively influenced by the model’s credibility, the extent to which models reduce uncertainties, the insights that models give into the effects of policies, the transparency of models and modeling studies, nor the extent to which they facilitate a mutual understanding of actors with conflicting interests. We recommend further testing of the general validity of our conclusions by evaluating other projects. ...|$|R

The fairness and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> six different types of transport pricing policies were systematically higher if policy outcomes were related to environmental justice and equality. The policy measures were evaluated as more acceptable and fair when respondents believed that future generations, nature and the environment were protected (reflecting environmental justice), and to a lesser extent, when everybody was equally affected by the policy outcomes (reflecting equality), irrespective of absolute differences in fairness and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the policies. Policy outcomes reflecting egoistic concerns (e. g. being financially worse off and being worse off than others) and equity (e. g. proportional to people's income and contribution to problems) were related to the fairness and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> some policy measures, but no systematic pattern was found across six policy measures.
