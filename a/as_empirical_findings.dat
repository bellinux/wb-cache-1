Due to shortcomings of previous studies with regard to the measurement of the main variables, our paper concentrates on new measurement approaches for sustainability disclosure and sustainability performance. Findings from a sample of 50 German and Swiss companies support our methodological approach. In particular, we find empirical evidence that legitimacy theory and voluntary disclosure theory likewise can explain certain aspects of sustainability reporting...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of the {{adoption}} of technological innovations on the efficiency of telecommunications (TLC) carriers. Firstly, since uncertainty and extra costs are likely to characterize the early phases of adoption, dynamic performances can be strikingly different from the steady state ones. Secondly, differences among carriers in technological history do matter; firms who cumulated a greater deal of specific innovations will be better at using the new technology. A cost model is formulated. The adoption of digital switching equipment is observed and a sample has been gathered for twelve european countries, over the period 1980 -' 89. As far <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> are concerned, innovative carriers expose themselves to a transient cost increase, to be cumulated with any subsequent efficiency gain; a cost cycle is determined by the adoption of new equipment; cumulativeness is at work.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} in economics {{as well as}} sociology have stressed {{the important role of}} business networks for cooperation, trust, and performance. This claim is based on solid theoretical arguments as well <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings.</b> However, neither theory nor the selective empirical results support the view that networks are always beneficial for economic transactions. This paper begins with an observation that for the purchase of IT products, network embeddedness leads to even more problems for the customer. In order to explain this effect, possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed using theory as well as empirics. The most promising explanation for this special case is the effect of uncertainty and incomplete information ex post. In order to reduce this uncertainty, the buyer forms beliefs {{on the basis of the}} opinions existing in a shared network or group. However, if the network members have the same problem of uncertainty, suppliers have an incentive to reduce their performance because such behavior will not be detected and sanctioned. An analysis of the customer's tolerance to a supplier's behavior in business transactions yields support for this argument. Even if problems in a transaction are kept constant, customers give suppliers more reputational credit if they share a common network. Reputation Business network Uncertainty...|$|E

How can be ensured that, coming from the paradigm of sustainable development, economic, ecological and social matters are implemented and managed by companies in an equal way? The instrument of the Balanced Scorecard is being discussed as a possible appropriate conceptual framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (e. g. see Bieker et al., 2001; Figge et al., 2001; Orssatto et al., 2001). But is the traditional BSC-concept effective enough to contribute to corporate social responsibility? <b>As</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> from recent research show, the predominance of the financial perspective of the BSC concept prevents companies from integrating sustainability-related issues in an equal way into this concept.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of technologies supporting transactions over distance and replacing traditional forms of interaction, designing for trust has become a core concern for researchers in both HCI and CMC. While much research focuses on increasing trust in mediated interactions, this paper takes a systemic view to identify the factors that support trustworthy behavior. In a second step, we analyze how the presence of these factors can be signaled to allow the formation of well-placed trust. For our analysis we draw on relevant research from sociology, economics, and psychology, as well <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> in HCI and CMC research. The key factors that warrant trust in another actor are contextual properties (temporal, social, and institutional embeddedness) and the trusted actor’s intrinsic properties (ability and motivation). In first interactions, trust is mainly warranted by contextual properties, as they provide external incentives and threat of punishment. As interactions are repeated over time and trust grows, intrinsic properties become more important. To increase the level of well-placed trust, researchers and designers need to identify signals for the presence of such trust-warranting properties that are reliable and easy to interpret. At the same time, they must be cheap to emit for actors whose actions are governed by them but costly to mimic for untrustworthy actors. Our analysis provides a frame of reference for the design of studies on trust in technology-mediated exchanges, as well as a guide for identifying trust requirements in design processes. We demonstrate application of the model in three scenarios: ecommerce, voice-enabled online gaming, and ambient technologies...|$|E
