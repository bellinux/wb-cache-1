40|$|EL 2, the {{dominant}} deep defect in undoped as-grown GaAs has attracted tremendous interest {{because of its}} peculiar optical properties and because of its technological importance {{for the growth of}} undoped semi-insulating GaAs. This paper first outlines the photoelectronic and optical properties of EL 2. The second part describes the optical properties of the <b>As</b> <b>sub</b> Ga antisite defect as inferred from magnetic resonance combined with optical techniques. A comparison of the data demonstrates that EL 2 and the <b>As</b> <b>sub</b> Ga antisite as defined by its electron-spin-resonance (ESR) behavior in undoped as-grown GaAs have the same optical properties. At present this fact is the most direct and convincing evidence that EL 2 is the <b>As</b> <b>sub</b> Ga antisite seen by and related techniques. Whether this antisite is an isolated defect or a complex with an arsenic interstitial is a highly controversial question...|$|R

5|$|In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, {{winning in}} 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a {{reaction}} time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon {{his own world}} record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s. Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted <b>a</b> <b>sub</b> 9.60 s time.
