5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight that was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he {{was pleased with the}} final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E

His life has taken {{a turn for the worse}} since The Dark Knight; his wife has left him and taken their children, and the mayor is planning to dismiss him from his job. Gordon feels guilty over his role in covering up Harvey Dent's crimes and is prepared to resign from his position as Commissioner over it, but then senses that Gotham is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under threat.|$|E
5|$|The USS Enterprise {{receives}} a distress call from Dr. Howard Clarke (Paul Lambert), {{the leader of}} a Federation scientific delegation on Ventax II, where the population {{is in a state of}} panic because they are convinced that their world will soon end. After the Enterprise arrives, they rescue Dr. Clarke who brings them up to date: a thousand years ago, according to Ventaxian history, the population entered a Faustian deal with Ardra, their mythology's devil. In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance, and improving their heavily polluted planet, the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later. As the millennium is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a close, the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies. These were said to be signs of her arrival.|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed that he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E

25|$|MEFO was a dummy {{company that}} was formed with {{relatively}} small amounts of capital {{that was used to}} finance German rearmament off the books. It issued bills without backing by its own resources but which were guaranteed redeemable at 1:1 for Reichsmarks for five years by the government. The MEFO bills amounts were considered a state secret and were an important element in the impression that Hitlerian economics was a success. This company essentially created a large amount of Reichsmarks off the books, inflating the currency in secret. Payment was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> due giving Hitler the option of shifting the German economy to export goods to pay the bills or going to war and paying the debts off from looting profits extracted from conquered states.|$|E
25|$|Suffering badly from malaria {{and other}} {{tropical}} diseases, {{the men were}} mainly used to provide work parties instead of undertaking the training that they would require for the fighting that would come. In June, the 53rd was attached to Maroubra Force and the following month it was split up, with two companies—'B' and 'C'—being sent to the area around Kokoda to reinforce the 39th Battalion, while {{the remainder of the}} battalion remained around Port Moresby in preparation to move up the Kokoda Track. That month the battalion received eight officer reinforcements from experienced 2nd AIF units. On 10 August, the 53rd Battalion was ordered to relieve the 39th, which was at the time positioned around Uberi. The two detached companies moved into position and upon their arrival they finally received a number of Bren guns and had a small amount of training with them, but it was not enough to bring them up to the standard required for combat against the battle-hardened Japanese soldiers that they were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up against.|$|E

500|$|Two {{types of}} traditions exist {{regarding}} Ali's awareness of his fate {{long before the}} assassination. This foreknowledge was through his own [...] "premonition of it" [...] or by Muhammad. Based on numerous traditions, Ali's beard staining with [...] "blood flowing from his head" [...] had been revealed by Muhammad or Ali. Another set of traditions by Muhammad says that [...] "the most evil man among the ancients was he who had killed the camel of the prophet Salih and among his contemporaries, he who would kill Ali."

[...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background.

500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{out of the water}} or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E

500|$|When the europium-doped yttrium {{orthovanadate}} red phosphor {{was discovered}} in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause {{a revolution in the}} color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors.

Khmer Rouge troops immediately began to forcibly empty the capital city, driving the population into the countryside and killing tens of thousands in the process. The Year Zero had begun.|$|E
