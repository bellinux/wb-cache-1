5|$|Four dihalides of cobalt(II) are known: cobalt(II) {{fluoride}} (CoF2, pink), cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2, blue), cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr2, green), cobalt(II) iodide (CoI2, blue-black). These halides {{exist in}} <b>anhydrous</b> and hydrated forms. Whereas the <b>anhydrous</b> dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{hydrated}} metal chlorides, hydrated iron(III) chloride {{can be converted}} to the <b>anhydrous</b> salt by refluxing with thionyl chloride. Conversion of the hydrate to <b>anhydrous</b> iron(III) chloride is not accomplished by heating, as HCl and iron oxychlorides are produced.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} is harmful, highly corrosive and acidic. The <b>anhydrous</b> {{material is}} a powerful dehydrating agent.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{trioxide}} {{is produced}} in the laboratory by the reaction of <b>anhydrous</b> potassium selenate (K2SeO4) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).|$|E
5|$|Used in <b>anhydrous</b> form as a {{drying reagent}} in certain reactions.|$|E
5|$|Also, pure {{lanthanum}} can {{be produced}} by electrolysis of molten mixture of <b>anhydrous</b> LaCl3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anhydrous</b> {{aluminium}} chloride {{is a powerful}} Lewis acid, capable of forming Lewis acid-base adducts with even weak Lewis bases such as benzophenone and mesitylene. It forms tetrachloroaluminate AlCl4− {{in the presence of}} chloride ions.|$|E
5|$|The water then {{carefully}} evaporated from the acidic solution to produce crystals of SnCl2·2H2O. This dihydrate can be dehydrated to <b>anhydrous</b> using acetic anhydride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anhydrous</b> SnCl2 {{can be used}} to make {{a variety}} of {{interesting}} tin(II) compounds in non-aqueous solvents. For example, the lithium salt of 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol reacts with SnCl2 in THF to give the yellow linear two-coordinate compound Sn(OAr)2 (Ar = aryl).|$|E
5|$|<b>Anhydrous</b> iron(III) {{chloride}} adopts the BiI3 structure, {{which features}} octahedral Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands. Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate consists of trans-+ cationic complexes and chloride anions, {{with the remaining}} two H2O molecules embedded within the monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium forms binary {{compounds}} {{with many}} non-metals. <b>Anhydrous</b> halides {{are known for}} F, Cl, Br and I. BeF2 has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. BeCl2 and BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25% <b>anhydrous</b> ethanol (the mandatory blend since 1993), or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels.|$|E
5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} <b>anhydrous</b> form, and if water has been absorbed {{it is easy to}} dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{chemistry}} tends not {{to involve}} π bonding {{due to the}} electron configuration of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the cyclopentadienyl complex La(C5H5)3, which is produced by reacting <b>anhydrous</b> LaCl3 with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran, and its methyl-substituted derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds. The <b>anhydrous</b> halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Some jurisdictions {{limit the}} sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily {{available}} source of lithium for ordinary consumers. Lithium {{can be used to}} reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in <b>anhydrous</b> ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions. This occurs during hydration of metal ions, so colourless <b>anhydrous</b> ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or <b>anhydrous</b> is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, {{to distinguish between the}} two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} sodium is {{volatile}} {{due to the}} difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or <b>anhydrous</b> mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide.|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under <b>anhydrous</b> mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. <b>Anhydrous</b> iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Mendeleev further {{predicted}} that eka-aluminium would be discovered {{by means of}} the spectroscope, and that metallic eka-aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would not react with air. He also {{predicted that}} M2O3 would dissolve in acids to give MX3 salts, that eka-aluminium salts would form basic salts, that eka-aluminium sulfate should form alums, and that <b>anhydrous</b> MCl3 should have a greater volatility than ZnCl2: all of these predictions turned out to be true.|$|E
5|$|The ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser {{plant is}} the <b>anhydrous</b> ammonia and {{granular}} plant operated by ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser Sdn Bhd (ABF), which is partly owned by Petronas. The company was formed on 6 December 1980. The plant started operation on 1 October 1985. It {{is also one}} of the largest granular urea plants in Asia. It is a joint venture by five ASEAN countries: Malaysia (63.5% shares), Thailand (13%), Indonesia (13%), the Philippines (9.5%), and Singapore (1%).|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. <b>Anhydrous</b> iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an <b>anhydrous</b> component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the <b>anhydrous</b> forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under <b>anhydrous</b> conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>anhydrous</b> {{neptunium}} oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as {{the full extent of}} the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, <b>anhydrous</b> salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of <b>anhydrous</b> metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with <b>anhydrous</b> hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of <b>anhydrous</b> LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of <b>anhydrous</b> ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in <b>anhydrous</b> methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
25|$|It {{can exist}} either in an <b>anhydrous</b> (water-free) form or as a monohydrate. The <b>anhydrous</b> form {{crystallizes}} from hot water, while the monohydrate forms when citric acid is crystallized from cold water. The monohydrate {{can be converted}} to the <b>anhydrous</b> form at about 78°C. Citric acid also dissolves in absolute (<b>anhydrous)</b> ethanol (76 parts of citric acid per 100 parts of ethanol) at 15°C. It decomposes with loss of carbon dioxide above about 175°C.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, a {{reaction}} between thionyl chloride and {{an excess of}} <b>anhydrous</b> alcohol {{can be used to}} produce <b>anhydrous</b> alcoholic solutions of HCl.|$|E
