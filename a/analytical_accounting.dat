40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{commentary}} is to address {{the issues raised by}} Ohlson {{from the point of view}} of <b>analytical</b> <b>accounting</b> research. The aim is not only to provide some input to young researchers who are going to publish good research using analytical methods, but also to give some hints to help users of <b>analytical</b> <b>accounting</b> research to understand and interpret the findings of this type of research. Ohlson has taken on a task of identifying a set of critical factors which are likely to lead to successful research. Good research is defined as research that makes an impression. Thus, it is not enough to get the research published - not even in a premier journal. The research should have an impact, the community should learn something. As Ohlson notes, there is enough 'ordinary' research. In my view this is the right attitude. Short-term optimization is also widespread in the research community and that is not what we should strive for. With the objective in place, I will continue to analyze the question in relation to analytical research. I start out discussing the aim of analytical research by providing a few examples of good models. The first is the Feltham-Ohlson model and the second is the agency model. Both are simple and elegant models dealing with difficult issues. The analysis proceeds to characterize good models. A good model is a simple model that zooms in on the problem under scrutiny. It is a 'minimal' model that contains the problem and nothing outside the problem. I then proceed to characterize good research in an analytical framework. This is research that tackles a problem that is of interest to the users and the researcher. In this process I also identify current notable analytical research. Finally, I contrast this to the recommendations of Ohlson. ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis commences with an {{introduction}} examining the external influences {{and the work}} ethic of J. S. Bach. The first aim, albeit subsidiary to the subsequent aim, is to magnify and raise the issues concerning the lacuna of fugal analytical methodology and the underwhelming quality of analytical literature on the J. S. Bach organ works. As such, the misconception of fugal terminology, the lax analytical interpretations {{and the lack of}} cogent and compelling <b>analytical</b> <b>accounts</b> are all addressed. The second aim which is integral to each <b>analytical</b> <b>account</b> of the fourteen fugues is to elucidate the contrapuntal paradigms and matrices contained therein. As of yet, attempts have not been made to provide rational schematic tables which illustrate the subject and countersubject(s) entries. Indeed, it is then of profound importance to examine each of these fourteen fugues and distil precisely the compositional procedures and mechanisms they possess. The fourteen fugues have not been selected without reasoning; they have also been selected to reveal a likely chronology. Fundamentally, they each reveal a vast spectrum of compositional traits, origins and hallmarks that are unique to each. The overarching purpose is thus to provide an enlightened comprehension as to the compositional procedures that define the essence of each fugue. Despite the fervour for J. S. Bach as a composer of outstanding calibre and how highly regarded the organ works are held, it is surprising that for in excess of two hundred and fifty years, the compositional procedures and structural designs of his organ works have yet to be fully understood. Whilst this thesis does not aim to provide an in - depth <b>analytical</b> <b>account</b> of each bar within each fugue, it nonetheless seeks to provide a cohesive account for the fourteen fugues and above all to reinforce that fugue is a radically varying compositional style. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the value of}} voluntary and mandatory disclosure in a market that applies International Accounting Standards (IAS) with limited penalties for non compliance. The lack of enforcement creates an element of choice {{in the level of}} mandatory disclosure by companies. Using panel-data analysis, our empirical results show that, after controlling for factors such as asset size and profitability, mandatory disclosure has a highly significant but negative relationship with firm value. This result, although puzzling from a traditional perspective, is consistent with the predictions of <b>analytical</b> <b>accounting</b> models, which emphasize the complex interplay of factors determining disclosure effects. Our results also show that voluntary disclosure has a positive but insignificant association with firm value. This lack of statistical significance supports the view that there is a complex interplay of different factors determining the relationship between disclosure and firm value.
