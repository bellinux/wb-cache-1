5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Michel Zink, whose {{influential}} 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge: Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole {{ushered in}} a new era of criticism, critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> literature about literature, a self-referential poem that comments on the improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status, encouraging a trend in studies of Renart and his work.|$|E

5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} read as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.

5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> beauty in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire {{refer to the}} mysteries of Isis, but the only source to {{describe}} them is <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written {{in the second century}} CE by Apuleius. In it, the initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into the innermost part of Isis's temple, where he has an intense religious experience, seeing the gods in person.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
