Hayworth later recalled, [...] "From the time I was {{three and a half}} … <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons." [...] She noted [...] "I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; I {{followed}} {{you here}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Tom Bradley made another will, {{as he lay}} dying. I must have it, Mr. Merrick." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> got to Geisenheimer's {{they played}} that 'Michigan' thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That time'," [...] he repeated. [...] "Why man, I {{have but}} just {{returned}} from the arena! You reached here almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I.</b> Had you been much later I should indeed have been worried, and <b>as</b> it is <b>I</b> had intended asking you about how you escaped the beast <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had completed the translation of this most interesting passage." ...|$|R
60|$|I am coming over, just <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can get {{the family}} moved and settled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, for I {{was finding}} my young friend a trifle overpowering, [...] "this is most satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|Allonby laughed. [...] "Of {{course you}} could. But, I had my instructions. I {{was told to}} give Mr. Torrance the message <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> without troubling anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} Walter any more," [...] I said, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> control myself. [...] "Oh, Laura, spare us both the wretchedness of talking of him now!" ...|$|E
60|$|On the way home, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was free, I upbraided Miss Grant for her cruelty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> {{will come}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. I {{will try to}} reach you by {{daylight}} to-morrow. My heart is with you. Call up the Redfields; they will help you." ...|$|R
60|$|Say to {{the gentlemen}} I will meet them {{personally}} at Fortress Monroe <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can get there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder you}} think so," [...] said Harry, laughing; [...] "but if I were you, I'd go home <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> {{and get some}} dry clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} {{two or three}} times,"' replied Bince, [...] "that I'd let you have it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get it. I can't get you any now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--er--I packed it in a hurry, you know. I {{wanted to}} go fishing, and so I got through <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Oh, I guess it's all right." ...|$|E
60|$|Induced by a {{despatch}} from General Grant, I {{join you}} at Fort Monroe <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can come.|$|R
6000|$|Shorty {{turned on}} him. [...] "Oh, you'll get yours <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> finish with your pardner, you little hog-wallopin' snooper, you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may spare all {{considerations}} concerning me, gentlemen,' again repeated Charles; 'yon {{mountain of}} Criffel shall fly <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> will.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{got away}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Gilbert was {{by way of}} {{becoming}} incoherent, and, so far as I was concerned, {{there was nothing more}} to be said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; O'Connor {{promised that}} he would ask for me, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak the language, so I stuck at it hard; and now, you see, I have got my reward." ...|$|E
6000|$|I lit in {{the middle}} of the floor, shot there by the {{electric}} suddenness of the surprise. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get my voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|IT is {{needless to}} tell you at what {{conclusion}} <b>I</b> arrived, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was sufficiently myself to think at all.|$|R
60|$|But <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{heard that}} the People's Revolution {{had taken place in}} Berlin I {{determined}} to make a second visit.|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} I was fully {{resolved}} neither should be, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{got into a}} situation to control the matter.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} I thought that his bad luck ’ad turned ’is brain. [...] "You’ve got it wrong," [...] I ses, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak. [...] "She walked out with me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold a pen, I sent a {{telegram}} to you. Pray, pray {{come by the}} earliest train. I also telegraphed to old Mr. Dunboyne, at the hotel in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] I asked, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak. [...] "I am {{yours and}} yours only. What have I said, what have I done, to deserve those dreadful words?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. One can't deny that. And three Percycross {{doctors are}} three more misfortunes. <b>I</b> must get home <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{come back}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] she promised, {{with a little}} break in her voice,--"as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> can, Mr. Heepman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' {{with some}} sulkiness, 'you won't be content without beggaring {{me of my}} trumpery twenty-five hundred <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am of age?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, my dear parents, and {{my beloved}} grandmother," [...] I continued, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, {{conscious}} {{of the necessity of}} being as prompt as possible, [...] "that you have misunderstood me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{went out}} to the carriage, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get away from you; but he wasn't in it. I sent Mr. Westover back to you and set out to look for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you tell}} me, Chainbearer, that Ursula has {{actually}} written a note, a letter, to this young man?" [...] I asked, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> muster resolution {{enough to put}} so revolting a question? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{decided that}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had had another morsel of cheese I would seek this Bassett {{out and be}} pretty eloquent.|$|R
60|$|I {{will send}} you my address <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am sure of it, or you can always write me to the theatre.|$|R
