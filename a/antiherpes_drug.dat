40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{selective}} <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been developed}} which all show great promise for the systemic and topical treatment of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections.

40|$|To {{determine}} if use of <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> protects {{against the development}} of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), data from 935 homosexual men with AIDS from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study were analyzed. In nested case-control analysis, neither acyclovir use for human immunodefi-ciency virus infection (odds ratio [OR], 0. 84; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 56 - 1. 26; P =. 39) nor acyclovir use for any indication (OR, 1. 02; 95 % CI, 0. 76 - 1. 38; P =. 89) {{was associated with a}} reduced risk of KS as initial AIDS diagnosis. In longitudinal analysis, acyclovir was also not protective against developing KS as a late manifestation of AIDS (after initial non-KS AIDS diagnosis). Among men with cytomegalovirus disease, ganciclovir use (relative risk [RR], 0. 56; 95 % CI, 0. 22 - 1. 44; P =. 23) and foscarnet use (RR, 0. 40; 95 % CI, 0. 051 - 3. 10; P =. 38) were associated (although not significantly) with a reduced risk of KS. Thus, acyclovir use does not appear {{to reduce the risk of}} KS, but further study of other <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> such as ganciclovir and foscarnet is warranted.

40|$|The remarkably potent and {{specific}} activity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) shown by 2 '-deoxynucleosides of furo[2, 3 -d]pyrimidin- 2 (3 H) -one and related ring systems {{is dependent on}} key structural features including the length {{and nature of the}} side-chain at C 6 and the structure and stereochemistry of the sugar moiety at N 3. Removal of the 3 '-hydroxyl group from potent anti-VZV 2 '-deoxynucleosides results in loss of the VZV activity, but such 2 ', 3 '-dideoxynucleoside analogues have shown anti-HCMV activity. We now report acyclic analogues with comparable side-chains at C 6, but with the sugar moiety at N 3 replaced with the (2 -hydroxyethoxy) methyl group (present in the <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drug</b> acyclovir). Examples of both furo[2, 3 -d]- and pyrrolo[2, 3 -d]pyrimidin- 2 (3 H) -one acyclic analogues were prepared and evaluated in a number of virus-infected cells and in tumor cell cultures.

40|$|The highly potent and {{selective}} <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drug</b> BVdUrd ((J 0 - 5 -(2 -bromo-vinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine] is cleared within 2 - 3 hours from the bloodstream upon intraperitoneal administration to rats. It is degraded to BVUra ((E) ~ 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) uracil) and this inactive metabolite is cleared very slowly from the bloodstream so that 2 A {{hours after the}} administration of BVdUrd, BVUra is still detectable in the plasma. This contrasts with several other 5 -substituted uracils, i. e. 5 -fluorouracil, 5 -iodouracil, 5 -trifluorothymine and thymine itself, which are, like their 2 '-deoxyuridine counterparts FdUrd, IdUrd, F 3 dThd and dThd, cleared from the plasma within 2 - 3 hours. The injec-tion of dThd {{or any of the}} other 5 -substituted 2 '-deoxyuridines at 3 hours after the injection of BVdUrd, that is at a time when BVdUrd has disappeared completely from the circulation, results in the re-apparition of BVdUrd in the plasma. Apparently, BVdUrd is regenerated from BVUra following the reac-tion catalyzed by pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases: BVUra + dThd •+ BVdUrd + Thy. BVdUrd can even be generated de novo if dThd (or FdUrd, IdUrd or F 3 dThd) are administered 3 hours after a preceding injection of BVUra.

40|$|The <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{aciclovir}} and ganciclovir, {{are considered}} the standard treatments and prophylactic agents for infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Until a decade ago, the impact of aciclovir on the control of severe and life-threatening herpesvirus infections was unprecedented. During the past few years, we have witnessed approval of new therapeutic drugs for infections caused by HSV and VZV (i. e. penciclovir and the oral prodrugs, valaciclovir and famciclovir), CMV (i. e. ganciclovir, cidofovir and fomivirsen) or HSV, VZV and CMV (i. e. foscarnet). A few agents, such as brivudin and benzimidavir, are in ongoing clinical development; others have been suspended because of safety concerns.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of combinations of HBPG and either ACV, phosphonoformate (PFA), or cidofovir (CDF) against HSV encephalitis. BALB/c mice were given ocular infections with HSV- 1 or HSV- 2, and treated twice daily intraperitoneally for five days with HBPG, alone or in combination with ACV, PFA, or CDF. Animals were observed daily for up to 30 days, and the day of death of each was recorded. All of the combinations showed additivity, and the combination of HBPG + ACV appeared to be synergistic, ie, protected more mice against HSV- 1 encephalitis compared with each drug given alone. Delay of treatment with HBPG for up to two days was still effective in preventing HSV- 2 encephalitis. The combination of the {{thymidine kinase}} inhibitor HBPG and the <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drug</b> ACV may have synergistic activity against HSV encephalitis. The development of a potent and safe combination therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of HSV infection of the central nervous system can improve the outcome of this infection in humans.

40|$|The {{commonly}} used antiviral drugs acyclovir (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV) possess similarly potent antiviral activities in vivo against {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV). Assay methods for sensitivity to ACV are not necessarily transferable to PCV, even though the two drugs have similar in vivo potencies and mechanisms of action. We determined by plaque reduction assay the relative activities of ACV and PCV against five laboratory-adapted strains of HSV types 1 and 2 (including sensitive and resistant strains) in seven human cell lines and one nonhuman primate cell line. Seven characteristics were {{used to evaluate the}} cell lines. All cell lines were similar in their plating efficiencies and abilities to discriminate between sensitive and resistant HSV isolates. Vero and MRC- 5 cells yielded the most discordant 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) for the two HSV types, while Vero and WI- 38 VA- 13 cells yielded large differences in the IC 50 s of ACV and PCV. The limited life spans and poor plaque morphologies of the fibroblast lines were undesirable characteristics. Among the transformed cell lines producing well-defined plaques, A 549 cells provided the best concordance between IC 50 s for the two HSV types and two <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs.</b> Comparison experiments with a yield reduction format indicated that the use of assays of this type might allow some of the cell-specific properties observed in plaque reduction assays to be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Herpes B virus (B virus [BV]) is a macaque {{herpesvirus}} that is occasionally {{transmitted to}} humans {{where it can}} cause rapidly ascending encephalitis that is often fatal. To understand the low susceptibility of BV to the acyclonucleosides, we have cloned, expressed, and characterized the BV thymidine kinase (TK), an enzyme {{that is expected to}} “activate” nucleoside analogs. This enzyme is similar in sequence and properties to the TK of herpes simplex virus (HSV), i. e., it has a broad substrate range and low enantioselectivity and is sensitive to inhibitors of HSV TKs. The BV enzyme phosphorylates some modified nucleosides and acyclonucleosides and l enantiomers of thymidine and related antiherpetic analogs. However, the potent anti-HSV drugs acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir (GCV), and 5 -bromovinyldeoxyuridine were poorly or not phosphorylated by the BV enzyme under the experimental conditions. The antiviral activities of a number of marketed <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> and experimental compounds were compared against BV strains and, for comparison, HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) in Vero cell cultures. For most compounds tested, BV was found to be about as sensitive as HSV- 1 was. However, BV was less sensitive to ACV and GCV than HSV- 1 was. The abilities of thymidine analogs and acyclonucleosides to inhibit replication of BV in Vero cell culture were not always proportional to their substrate properties for BV TK. Our studies characterize BV TK {{for the first time and}} suggest new lead compounds, e. g., 5 -ethyldeoxyuridine and pencyclovir, which may be superior to ACV or GCV as treatment for this emerging infectious disease...|$|R

As viral resistance to available chemical drugs causes problems {{in the treatment of}} herpes simplex virus type 1 infection, there is an evolving need for new <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs.</b> Therefore in the present study 5 species of medicinal plants with ethno-medical background were screened for antiherpes effect against HSV- 1 in Hep- 2 (Human epithelial type 2) cells. Different parts of the plants were collected and aqueous extract of them were prepared. These extracts were screened for their cytotoxicity against Hep- 2 cell line by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay at concentrations 50 - 1000 μg/ml. Antiherpes properties of the extracts were determined by cytopathic effect inhibition assay. Four plants extract; Thymus kotschyanus, Echinacea purpurea, Camellia sinensis and Echium amoenum L exhibited significant antiherpes effect against HSV- 1 at nontoxic concentrations to the cell lines used. The extracts of Thymus kotschyanus and Camellia sinensis showed highest antiherpes activity against HSV- 1 at most concentrations. Our findings indicated that Camellia sinensis extract has inhibit HSV- 1 multiplication at concentrations 50 - 1000 μg/ml while this figure for Thymus kotschyanus is 100 - 800 μg/ml and for Echinacea purpurea and Echium amoenum L are > 400 μg/ml. Four plants extract of assay exhibited significant antiherpes activity at a concentration nontoxic to the cell line used.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) variants infect humans. HHV- 6 B is the {{etiologic agent}} of roseola and {{is associated with}} life-threatening neurological diseases, such as encephalitis, as well as organ transplant failure. The epidemiology and disease association for HHV- 6 A remain ill-defined. Specific anti-HHV- 6 drugs do not exist and classic <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> have secondary effects that are often problematic for transplant patients. Clinical trials using IFN were also performed with inconclusive results. We investigated the efficacy of type I IFN (α/β) in controlling HHV- 6 infection. We report that cells infected with laboratory strains and primary isolates of HHV- 6 B are resistant to IFN-α/β antiviral actions {{as a result of}} improper IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) expression. In contrast, HHV- 6 A-infected cells were responsive to IFN-α/β with pronounced antiviral effects observed. Type II IFN (γ) -signaling was unaltered in cells infected by either variant. The HHV- 6 B immediate-early 1 (IE 1) physically interacts with STAT 2 and sequestrates it to the nucleus. As a consequence, IE 1 B prevents the binding of ISGF 3 to IFN-responsive gene promoters, resulting in ISG silencing. In comparison, HHV- 6 A and its associated IE 1 protein displayed marginal ISG inhibitory activity relative to HHV- 6 B. The ISG inhibitory domain of IE 1 B mapped to a 41 amino acid region absent from IE 1 A. Transfer of this IE 1 B region resulted in a gain of function that conferred ISG inhibitory activity to IE 1 A. Our work is unique in demonstrating type I IFN signaling defects in HHV- 6 B-infected cells and highlights a major biological difference between HHV- 6 variants...|$|R
40|$|Most viral diseases, {{with the}} {{exception}} of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all <b>antiherpes</b> <b>drugs</b> inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M 2 protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-α and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t) ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti–human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M 2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections.

40|$|Herpes virus {{thymidine}} kinases {{are responsible}} for the activation of nucleoside antiviral drugs including (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine. Such viral thymidine kinases (tk), beside having a broader substrate specificity compared with host cell enzymes, also show significant variation in nucleoside phosphorylation among themselves. We have determined the crystal structure of Varicella zoster virus (VZV, human herpes virus 3) thymidine kinase complexed with (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine 5 '-monophosphate and ADP. Differences in the conformation of a loop region (residues 55 - 61) and the position of two alpha-helices at the subunit interface of VZV-tk compared with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (human herpes virus 1) enzyme give rise to changes in the positioning of residues such as tyrosine 66 and glutamine 90, which hydrogen bond to the substrate in the active site. Such changes in combination with the substitution in VZV-tk of two phenylalanine residues (in place of a tyrosine and methionine), which sandwich the substrate pyrimidine ring, cause an alteration in the positioning of the base. The interaction of the (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine deoxyribose ring with the protein is altered by substitution of tyrosine 21 and phenylalanine 139 (analagous to herpes simplex virus type 1 histidine 58 and tyrosine 172), which may explain some of the differences in nucleoside sugar selectivity between both enzymes. The altered active site architecture may also account for the differences in the substrate activity of ganciclovir for the two thymidine kinases.
