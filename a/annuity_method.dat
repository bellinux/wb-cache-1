40|$|With the {{dramatic}} increase {{expected in the}} number of older people requiring care, and the tightening of public funding, individuals will be increasingly expected to contribute to and plan for their own care in later life. However, history shows us that people are very reluctant to save for their care to the extent that there are no longer any providers of pre-funded long-term care insurance products in the UK to help address this problem. In this paper, we consider a product which is a disability-linked annuity that provides benefit payments towards the cost of both domiciliary and residential nursing care. We investigate different ways in which individuals can purchase this product with the goal of minimising the impact on their living standards, hence making the purchase of the product more palatable. As well as the traditional methods of purchasing insurance out of income and savings, this product can also be purchased by making use of assets such as residential property. This flexibility would allow individuals to have control over the timing of their payments to fit around their lifestyle. Some people will be more attracted to particular payment methods than others and a framework is presented which segments people according to individual circumstances. A model is developed showing how the annuity works and how premiums are calculated.

40|$|In the ‘Actieprogramma leegstaande kantoren’ the {{strategies}} of redevelopment, transformation and demolition of existing office buildings are suggested to reduce the high vacancy rate in the Dutch office market. Available research on which strategy is most sustainable did not incorporate the estimated service life of {{the strategies}}, but applied a standard expectation, which leads to an inaccurate estimation of the environmental load per year of service life. Because the strategy is chosen in the initiative phase of a project, the design is often not present for all strategies. A perfect design for the new-build structure is often assumed leading to an unequal comparison of designs. To find {{the effect of the}} estimated service life (ESL) on the sustainability of vacancy strategies the S 3 model is developed that includes ESL and replaces the design of a strategy with ambition levels. The sustainability of three real and one averaged case is assessed and the effect of the ESL on these results is analyzed. The model does not include financial or social factors. Sustainability has been defined as ecological sustainability as calculated by Greencalc+ 4. 0. A comparison is made between the linear deduction in the lifespan accounting model and an annuity deduction. To prevent negative ESL values the improved factor method by Van Nunen (2010) is adapted and a piecewise formula is used to determine the ESL. A method that standardizes the assessment of ESL factors has been developed. Score tables describe the requirements for a building to be assigned a certain score, which are later translated to factors. The results show that the estimated service life does influence the measurement of the sustainability of vacancy strategies. Because the environmental load caused by materials is deducted over the entire service life, a higher ESL reduces the load per year for materials more than a lower ESL. This means that strategies with a higher ESL are advantaged. Excluding the remaining environmental load decreases this effect because it decreases the environmental load caused by materials. A positive <b>annuity</b> deduction <b>method</b> will cause a higher remaining environmental load and will increase the effect of including the ESL. A negative annuity will cause a lower remaining environmental load and will decrease the effect of including the ESL. Real Estate ManagementReal Estate & HousingArchitectur...|$|R
40|$|Residual value (RV) is an {{important}} component of Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), often valued at 20 % to 50 % of total construction costs. It is often overlooked which can artificially depress the project?s returns. The treatment of RV is inadequate and needs further research. Residual value represents the value of the infrastructure {{at the end of its}} project lifetime and the value that the asset generates from then on. We analyze three methods for calculating RV: straight-line depreciation, annuity/perpetuity and component. The straight-line depreciation method is the most commonly used; it is simple and quick to produce and it typically uses a percent of the total construction cost rather than real value. The perpetuity/annuity method ignores the actual value of the asset. It reflects the difference of costs and benefits between economic and useful life (<b>annuity</b> <b>method)</b> or assumes an infinite economic life (perpetuity method). The component method is the most detailed and difficult to calculate method. It gives the actual value of the physical asset at the end of project appraisal by infrastructure component. We assume three scenarios for the future for the component method. We use the case study of the Portuguese High Speed Rail project to calculate and compare each method. As expected, the perpetuity has the highest RV and net present value (NPV), followed by the <b>annuity</b> <b>method</b> and then the component method. The straight-line method produces the lowest values (other than one scenario for the component method). Sensitivity analysis is performed ceteris paribus for the demand, construction cost and discount rate factors. We conclude that RV is important in situations when the benefit-cost ratio is close to 1 and the method selected can have a large impact on the size (and sign) of the NPV...|$|E

40|$|Thesis by publication. Bibliography: pages 155 - 164. Faced with an {{uncertain}} time of death, retirees may find annuities useful {{as they can}} provide a stable lifestream of income upon retirement. In reality, around the world, the voluntary annuity take-up rate is low. Researchers suggest {{this may be due}} to several possible reasons, such as a strong bequest motive, low financial literacy, a security system with generous benefits, or the lack of liquidity to prepare for unexpected medical expenses. In this thesis, three research papers are developed, each contributing to the main goal of the thesis, which is to provide readers with a greater understanding of the economicc value of annuities for retirees. The first research paper analyses the value for money of two private annuity products in Malaysia, one is sold in 2000 and another in 2012. Two widely known methods used by economists to value annuities, the Money's Worth Ratio and the Annuity Equivalent Wealth, are utilised in this analysis. This is first such study for Malaysia. The second paper extends the original <b>Annuity</b> Equivalent Wealth <b>method</b> to incorporate several health states that may occur during the life-cycle of annuity buyers. The model allows us to value annuity products with not only the common annuity stream of income but also additional benefits that attach to other health states such as critical illness and total and permanent disability. Another original contribution of this paper is to apply a health state dependent utility function, which values a unit of consumption differently according to the current health state of the consumer. A health utility index taken from health economics studies is used to study the changes of Annuity EquivalentWealth of annuities under both the health state independent and health state dependent utility function. The final paper studies the impact of annuitisation in a general equilibrium framework where the economic agents, households, have a bequest motive. The model developed allows households to insure or annuitise optimally over their lifecycle. The model is a simple closed economy model with overlapping generations that consist of a young, middle aged and old generation. The changes in welfare for all generations and the future newborn generation as the economy reaches a new steady-state with the presence of insurance and annuity markets are calculated. Introducing insurance and annuity markets in the economy improves the welfare of the future newborn generation. This is an original contribution, and reverses the finding of a tragedy of annuitisation which arises if no bequest motive is present.

40|$|The aim {{and scope}} of the project is to study and apply Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) to {{standard}} bridges with a length of ca 20 m. Eleven bridges of reinforced concrete in northern Sweden have been studied with data from BaTMan, a Swedish bridge data base. Two alternative designs with timber (Glulam) and soil-steel (SuperCor) have also been studied. The concept of Present Value <b>Method,</b> <b>Annuity</b> Cost, and Societal Costs are described and the importance is discussed of parameters such as inflation and interest rates. In the analysis the following choices were made: interest rate 4 % and inflation rates for Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation (MR&R) 1, 5 %, for planning and design 2 %, for dismantling 3 % and for user’s costs 5 %. Methods are described for calculating user costs and for performing traffic analysis with a Swedish model called Sampers. Historical data and forecasts are presented. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how and how much the parameters involved in the analysis influence the final result. The life cycle costs for the eleven bridges vary between 4 and 20 Mkr and their annuity costs between 7 and 39 kkr. The lower costs refer to bridges with low initial investment (2, 5 Mkr) and low traffic (20 vehicles/day), whereas the higher costs refer to bridges with high initial investment (11 Mkr) and high traffic (5000 vehicles/day). Of the life cycle costs, initial investments are 45 – 84 %, user costs are 0, 6 – 47 %, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MR&R) are 4 – 14 %, dismantling are 1, 4 – 5, 6 % and planning and design costs are 0, 7 – 3, 8 %. Bridge designs with timber and soil-steel (SuperCor) are presented based on information collected from producers. LCCA has then been performed for three scenarios with different traffic volumes (100, 500 and 5000 vehicles per day in 2009), which reflect the situation in different Swedish regions. The estimated life cycle costs for the three scenarios are 2, 3 Mkr, 2, 4 Mkr and 4, 4 Mkr for the soil-steel bridges and 2, 5 Mkr, 2, 7 Mkr and 4, 7 Mkr for the timber bridges respectively. The annuity costs are 9 kkr, 9 kkr and 17 kkr for the soil-steel bridges and 10 kkr, 11 kkr and 19 kkr for the timber bridges respectively. The main conclusions from the project are that initial costs, user costs and life length have the highest influence on the life cycle costs and the annuity costs. Furthermore there exist no unique type of bridge that {{can be seen as the}} most cost efficient one. Rather, the economic efficiency depends on the location of the bridge and on the traffic volumes in that particular area. Future development is needed regarding data and stochastic and other models for forecasting of traffic, interest rates and inflation rates. Data bases need to be updated with initial costs, MR&R and life lengths for various bridge designs. Finally improved, user friendly software for LCCA would improve the beneficial use of this important concept for transportation investment decisions. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a disaggregated {{version of the}} abnormal earnings growth (AEG) model of Ohlson and Juettner-Nauroth (2005). The value of the firm then becomes discounted free cash flows minus initial debt. Discounted free cash flows are equal to capitalized operating earnings from the initial stock of operating assets plus {{the present value of}} an infinite sequence of growth projects, where each growth project is valued by discounted economic value added. Sufficient conditions for the present value of the free cash flows to be equal to the sum of these two components are investigated. The Gordon growth formula is found to be one special case. Another case concerns lumpy growth projects with depreciation according to the <b>annuity</b> <b>method.</b> We then allow for three different interest rates, the required rate of return on equity under all-equity financing, the borrowing rate, and the required rate of return on equity under partial debt financing (the latter given by MM’s Proposition 2). In the model of Ohlson and Juettner-Nauroth, these rates are the same. A firm-level model is developed that focuses on operating earnings and free cash flows with discounting at the required rate of return under all-equity financing. An equity-level model is then developed that focuses on bottom-line earnings and dividends with discounting at the required rate of return under partial debt financing. Relationships between the two models are explored. Dividend policy irrelevance holds only in a limited sense for the equity-level model...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} and limited resource. Municipal wastewater is a promising source of P via reuse and {{could be used to}} replace P derived from phosphate rocks. The agricultural use of sewage sludge is restricted by legislation or is not practiced in several European countries due to environmental risks posed by organic micropollutants and pathogens. Several technologies have been developed in recent years to recover wastewater P. However, these technologies target different P-containing flows in wastewater treatment plants (effluent, digester supernatant, sewage sludge, and sewage sludge ash), use diverse engineering approaches and differ greatly with respect to P recycling rate, potential of removing or destroying pollutants, product quality, environmental impact and cost. This work compares 19 relevant P recovery technologies by considering their relationships with existing wastewater and sludge treatment systems. A combination of different methods, such as material flow analysis, damage units, reference soil method, <b>annuity</b> <b>method,</b> integrated cost calculation and a literature study on solubility, fertilizing effects and handling of recovered materials, is used to evaluate the different technologies with respect to technical, ecological and economic aspects. With regard to the manifold origins of data an uncertainty concept considering validity of data sources is applied. This analysis revealed that recovery from flows with dissolved P produces clean and plant-available materials. These techniques may even be beneficial from economic and technical perspectives under specific circumstances. However, the recovery rates (a maximum of 25 %) relative to the wastewater treatment plant influent are relatively low. The approaches that recover P from sewage sludge apply complex technologies and generally achieve effective removal of heavy metals at moderate recovery rates (~ 40 – 50 % relative to the WWTP input) and comparatively high costs. Sewage sludge ash is the most promising P source, with recovery rates of 60 – 90 % relative to the wastewater P. The costs highly depend on the purity requirements of the recycled products but can be kept comparatively low, especially if synergies with existing industrial processes are exploited...|$|E
40|$|The {{economical}} {{competitiveness of}} various power plant alternatives is compared. The comparison comprises merely electricity producing power plants. Combined heat and power (CHP) producing power will cover {{part of the}} future power deficit in Finland, but also condensing power plants for base load production will be needed. The following types of power plants are studied: nuclear power plant, combined cycle gas turbine plant, coal-fired condensing power plant, peat-fired condensing power plant, wood-fired condensing power plant and wind power plant. The calculations are carried out by using the <b>annuity</b> <b>method</b> with a real interest rate of 5 % per annum and with a fixed price level as of January 2008. With the annual peak load utilization time of 8000 hours (corresponding to a load factor of 91, 3 %) the production costs would be for nuclear electricity 35, 0 €/MWh, for gas based electricity 59, 2 €/MWh and for coal based electricity 64, 4 €/MWh, when using a price of 23 €/tonCO 2 for the carbon dioxide emission trading. Without emission trading the production cost of gas electricity is 51, 2 €/MWh and that of coal electricity 45, 7 €/MWh and nuclear remains the same (35, 0 €/MWh) In order to study the impact {{of changes in the}} input data, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out. It reveals that the advantage of the nuclear power is quite clear. E. g. the nuclear electricity is rather insensitive to the changes of nuclear fuel price, whereas for natural gas alternative the rising trend of gas price causes the greatest risk. Furthermore, increase of emission trading price improves the competitiveness of the nuclear alternative. The competitiveness and payback of the nuclear power investment is studied also as such by using various electricity market prices for determining the revenues generated by the investment.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this project {{is to make a}} {{comparison}} of costs associated with wind and nuclear power in order to decide which one of these is the most suitable {{in the case of an}} increased demand for electricity. It is also investigated if there are other factors that can influence the choice of energy source. An average cost is calculated in terms of kronor per kilowatt-hour (SEK/kWh) using cost of investment, operation & maintenance and taxes & subsidies. Total investment cost is recalculated to production cost using the <b>annuity</b> <b>method</b> at three different interest rates (6 %, 9 % and 12 %). The comparison is made between three cases of wind power and two cases of nuclear power. For wind power there are two ocean-based (300 MW and 100 MW installed capacity, respectively) and one land-based (60 MW) wind farm. For nuclear power there is one EPR-reactor (1600 MW) and one AP 1000 -reactor (1100 MW). From the calculations it is evident that nuclear power in most cases is the most cost efficient alternative regardless of whether or not the taxes & subsidies are taken into account. However, land-based wind power is for some cases with high interest rate less expensive than the EPR-reactor, even if taxes & subsidies are excluded. If they are included, land-based wind power is less expensive than both the EPR-reactor and the AP 1000 -reactor. The smaller of the ocean-based wind farms (100 MW) is almost equal to the case of the EPR-reactor when taxes & subsidies are included. The larger ocean-based wind farm (300 MW) is the most expensive alternative in all cases. Least expensive in the majority of cases is the AP 1000 -reactor. There are several large problems related to the unsteady production of wind power. At a large-scale expansion both a great amount of regulating power and heavy reinforcements in the electricity grid are required. There is also a correlation between low availability during cold winter days when the electricity demand is at its largest. For nuclear power there are additional costs for fuel both before and after usage. This cost amounts to 0. 06 - 0. 08 SEK/kWh for both purchase of fuel and treatment of waste...|$|E
40|$|Cooling {{down the}} indoor air {{can be done}} in several ways. One way is desiccantcooling which will be used at the Stockholm Arena. This method is used in airhandling units that use {{temperature}} changes and moisture fluctuations in the air. Oneof the steps is to add heat during the cooling process {{in order to reduce the}} relativehumidity of the exhaust air. The air passes thru an adsorptions rotor which thenabsorbs moisture from the supply air. This results in the closing stages that the supplyair temperature drops when hydrating and the result is a cooler indoor temperaturethan the outdoor. This report is a result of a diploma work in building construction at UppsalaUniversity and is written as a guide for the Stockholm Arena to reduce theconsumption of purchased thermal energy, with the aim of producing its own energy. This is reported from a technical perspective, focusing at the design of a propersystem. Heat energy is today planned to be brought from district heating. It couldthou be replaced by other alternatives such as solar panels. To determine this, itinvestigates whether and to what degree solar panels can replace the district heat atthe cooling process of the indoor air from a technical perspective. This has beenimplemented with literature studies and interviews and further on calculations ofenergy but also financially by the <b>annuity</b> <b>method.</b> The case is focused on the summer conditions when the sorptive refrigeration willbe used. According to that calculations and assumptions have been made for probableenergy consumption and production. There after the investment costs weredetermined. The results gave that flat glazed solar collectors had a lower cost based on theenergy production but it required a much larger area than the vacuum solarcollectors. Based on the investment cost, vacuum solar collectors would be lesseconomi-cally significant. Further analysis showed that the solar panels took up almost the same amount ofarea whether of choosing them to stand free or be placed right on the roof. Theinvestigations of the operating temperature of the heating coil gained 60 degreesCelsius to optimize the performance. The size of the storage tank should not exceed 3 cubic meters to obtain adequate energy changes. Solar energy is added to the tankat an external heat exchanger. At times when the heat input from the solar panels islower than required the district heat is the most appropriate kind to provide externalheat. This heat is given to the hot water slope leaving the tanks so it won’t disrupt theenergy output from the solar panels. In converted case where the production of heatis greater than required the heat energy can be used for hot water production...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal heat storage, {{which is}} used to balance the supply of and demand for heat, e. g. in {{district}} heating networks, is necessary for the large-scale utilization of solar heat. The aim of this thesis was to study and develop seasonal heat storage to a point where it, if possible, would be an option in Swedish heating systems. Initial theoretical calculations indicated that the borehole heat store was feasible for seasonal heat storage. In the borehole heat store sensible heat is stored in the bedrock. The bedrock is penetrated by evenly spaced vertical boreholes, which are drilled within a square or circular land area. The holes work as heat exchangers between a heat carrier (normally water), which is pumped through the pipe system of the boreholes and the storage volume. Performed measurements in a pilot plant verified the predicted thermal behaviour of the store. A pre-design of a large-scale heat store, within the University area, was performed. After assuming the operation cycle and the properties of the store, the thermal behaviour of the Luleå heat store was simulated. The construction work of this large-scale borehole heat store (120, 000 m 3) was studied in detail and the performance was evaluated during {{the first five years of}} operation. It was found that there were several short-comings in design, construction and operation. The operation of the heat pumps caused problems. The borehole pipes were incorrectly installed, which decreased the charged heat by 23 % and recovered heat by about 34 %. Without changing the storage task the store could have been built at a cost of 4. 5 MSEK instead of 6. 3 MSEK. A model was developed to determine the optimum design of borehole heat stores. The optimum design was defined as the design that fulfils the storage task at a minimum annual storage cost, i. e. the sum of the annual costs of the investment, operation, maintenance and heat loss. The optimum and actual designs of three stores were evaluated and compared. The more recently constructed plants differed less from the optimum design than the oldest plant, situated in Luleå. The main reason was the increasing engineering experience, which influenced the design of the later stores. Typical data for the optimum design are drilling depths of 125 m and a borehole spacing of 4 m. In a 1. 6 GWh store, 65 boreholes result in a storage volume of about 125, 000 m 3. The specific construction cost, which decreases with increasing heat extraction capacity, is 1. 50 SEK/ KWh or 20 SEK/m 3 at an heat extraction capacity of 7 GWh. The <b>annuity</b> <b>method</b> (6 %, 25 y) was used to calculate the annual investment cost, which stood for approximately 65 % of the total annual storage cost. The sensitivity of the different parameters was investigated with the optimization model. It was demonstrated that the technical design of the store was greatly influenced by the cost parameters. For example, small changes in the drilling cost could mean a very different design. It was also found that it was cost-effective to investigate the soil depth and the rock thermal conductivity in detail before the design of the borehole heat store was performed.

40|$|The {{alternative}} fuel production pathway by solar thermochemical splitting {{of water and}} carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon monoxide by redox reactions of a metal oxide, and their subsequent conversion into liquid fuels by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, is investigated. These fuels could provide a means to completely decarbonize the transport sector and thus to significantly reduce its climate impact. A generic model is developed for the description of solar thermochemical reactors including heat exchangers, where reduced elements of redox material move from the reduction to the oxidation chamber {{through a number of}} heat exchanger chambers, in which they transfer energy by radiation to the cold elements moving in counter-flow. In a first implementation of the model, infinitely fast thermal diffusion within the material is assumed and the influence on heat exchange of the wall separating the hot from the cold elements is neglected. A heat exchanger efficiency potential of over 80 % is determined, where efficiency is increased towards higher reaction temperatures and reaches its maximum value in the reduction pressure range of 10 - 100 Pa due to a trade-off between additional energy requirements for vacuum pumping and enhanced fuel productivity. In a second implementation of the model, the effect of the separating wall is considered and heat diffusion in the porous redox material is solved. Heat exchanger efficiency is found to have a potential of about 70 %, where heat diffusion in the redox material is identified to be a limiting factor for heat exchange. The system can be enhanced by increasing the porosity as well as optimizing material thickness and total residence time of the elements in the heat exchanger. Through an efficient design of the heat exchanger, efficiencies close to the optimal case of infinitely fast heat diffusion can be reached. The model is adapted for the description of heat exchange between two unmixed particle beds moving in opposite directions in a cylindrical enclosure. Heat exchanger efficiency is found to have a potential of close to 60 % and to be limited by heat transfer within the particle beds which can be enhanced e. g. by optimizing the bed diameter, heat exchanger length, particle size, and the velocity of the beds. The analysis is complemented by an assessment of ecological and economic performance of a baseline case fuel production plant. The baseline assumptions are that the plant has an output of 1000 barrels per day (bpd) of jet fuel and 865 bpd of naphtha, uses water from seawater desalination and carbon dioxide by capture from the atmosphere, has a thermochemical efficiency of 20 %, and uses heat and electricity provided by conversion of solar primary energy and combustion of the gaseous Fischer-Tropsch products. The energy conversion efficiency from incident sunlight to lower heating value of the produced fuels is determined to be 5. 0 %. A life cycle analysis shows greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0. 49 kgCO 2 -eq. per liter of jet fuel, which is a reduction of over 80 % compared to conventional jet fuel. The main drivers of the GHG emissions are identified to be the origins of carbon dioxide and electricity, the combustion of gaseous Fischer-Tropsch products, and the construction of the solar concentration infrastructure. The water consumption is 7. 4 liters per liter jet fuel for on-site processes and 40. 2 liters for off-site processes, which is orders of magnitude lower than that of biofuels and about equal to that of fossil fuels. The area-specific productivity is 3. 3 × 104 liters of jet fuel equivalents per hectare and year, which is lower than the best power-to-liquid pathways but about an order of magnitude higher than that of biofuels. An economic model based on the <b>annuity</b> <b>method</b> shows production costs of 2. 23 € per liter of jet fuel for the baseline case. The economic drivers are the construction and operation of the solar concentration facility, the provision of electricity by an on-site concentrated solar power plant, carbon dioxide capture, and the lifetime of the fuel production plant. Thermochemical efficiency and solar irradiation have an important influence both on the GHG emissions and the plant economics through their determination of the required size of the solar concentration facility. It is found that jet fuel production with emissions significantly lower than conventional fuel requires a renewable source both for carbon dioxide and for electricity, such as carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere and electricity generation from sunlight. Assuming favorable development of the involved process steps, production costs of 1. 28 € per liter jet fuel at greenhouse gas emissions of 0. 10 kgCO 2 -eq. per liter are estimated. The realization of high thermochemical efficiencies is crucial for the development of an economic fuel production pathway due to its direct influence on the required size of the solar concentration facility. The developed models can be used for the continued comprehensive analysis of the fuel production pathway including the large parameter space in the design of solar thermochemical reactors and thus provide a valuable tool for further research and design...|$|E
