500|$|Aqua vitae in its {{alcoholic}} forms {{was highly}} praised by medieval physicians. In 1309 Arnaldus of Villanova wrote that [...] "t prolongs good health, dissipates superfluous humours, reanimates {{the heart and}} maintains youth." [...] In the Late Middle Ages, the production of moonshine started to pick up, especially in the German-speaking regions. By the 13th century, Hausbrand (literally [...] "home-burnt" [...] from gebrannter wein, brandwein; [...] "burnt [...] wine") was commonplace, marking the origin of brandy. Towards {{the end of the}} Late Middle Ages, the consumption of spirits became so ingrained even among the general population that restrictions on sales and production began to appear in the late 15th century. In 1496 the city of Nuremberg issued restrictions on the selling of <b>aquavit</b> on Sundays and official holidays.|$|E

Kennicott lifted the farmer into a chair and chuckled, [...] "There we are, Halvor! We'll have you out fixing fences and {{drinking}} <b>aquavit</b> in a month." [...] The farmwife sat on the couch, expressionless, bulky in a man's dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets. The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her seamed neck. Her white wool gloves lay in her lap.|$|E

50|$|In 1602, {{angelica}} {{was introduced}} in Niort, which had just been ravaged by the plague. It is used to flavour liqueurs or <b>aquavits,</b> (e.g., Chartreuse, Bénédictine, Vermouth, and Dubonnet), omelettes and trout, and as jam. The long bright-green stems are also candied and used as decoration.|$|R
50|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is an international}} restaurant with Scandinavian flair and not an ethnic restaurant. It was conceived to be a restaurant for New Yorkers and visitors to New York and not a culinary home-away-from-home for Scandinavian expats. The menu has a Scandinavian flavor profile without featuring special Scandinavian ethnic dishes. The menu favors seafood and offers several tasting menus {{as well as a}} vegetarian menu. <b>Aquavit’s</b> café is distinctly more traditional in its roots. A substantial portion of the menu showcases Scandinavian specialties such as Meatballs with Lingonberries, Gravlax and a variety of herrings. The Lounge offers small portions of dishes offered in the café and the Private Dining Room has a menu targeted to corporate customers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aquavit</b> is an {{important}} part of Scandinavian drinking culture, where it is often drunk during festive gatherings, such as Christmas dinners and weddings, and as an aperitif. In Sweden, Denmark and Germany <b>aquavit</b> is cooled down and often sipped slowly from a small shot glass. This is usually attributed to tradition. Most commonly the <b>aquavit</b> is consumed immediately following a song, called a snapsvisa. The most well-known song is Helan Går. In Finland and Sweden, <b>aquavit</b> consumed from a shot glass is commonly associated with crayfish parties, which are traditionally held during late August. In Norway, where most <b>aquavit</b> is matured in oak casks, the drink is served at room temperature in tulip-shaped glasses or shot glasses. <b>Aquavit</b> arguably complements dark beer well, and its consumption is very often preceded by a swig of beer.|$|E
50|$|After 17 {{years in}} one {{location}} (2004), <b>Aquavit</b> relocated in 2005 to new premises giving the restaurant {{an entirely new}} look. <b>Aquavit</b> opened a second restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1999, but it failed to take hold and ultimately closed in mid-2003.|$|E
50|$|As a young man, Jørgen {{studied in}} Berlin. Jørgen's father, Nicolay, {{established}} a soap factory on Fagerheim in Trondheim, {{together with his}} brother. In 1821 was the factory signed over to Jørgen {{and he made a}} liquor factory out of it. The factory delivered all kinds of liquor, such as punsj and <b>aquavit.</b> Lysholm was the first to produce Linie <b>Aquavit,</b> which became the company’s most popular brand and best selling product. Today, Linie <b>Aquavit</b> is still represented as in 1842.|$|E
50|$|Danish Distillers (De Danske Spritfabrikker) is {{a company}} that was {{headquartered}} in Aalborg, Denmark. Isidor Henius, the father of Max Henius, was {{one of the founders of}} a company that was acquired by Danish Distillers, which ended up owning all Danish spirits production. It is owned by the Norwegian-based Arcus Group since 2012. To avoid a dominant position in the Danish market, Arcus had to divest the brand Brøndums Snaps (akvavit). This brand was sold to Finland's Altia group spirits producer. The company is known for its Aalborg <b>aquavits.</b> It was established in 1881 by C. F. Tietgen. The building is located west of the Limfjord Bridge. Completed in 1931, it was designed in Neoclassical style by the architect Alf Cock-Clausen. It is now a Danish National Heritage site. The factory in Aalborg closed in April 2015 when production was moved to Norway.|$|R

5000|$|Some local off-licences in the {{northeast}} of England where there are strong historic links with Norway {{have been known to}} sell Norwegian akevitt occasionally. The drink tends to be popular amongst older people. Psychopomp Microdistillery [...] in Bristol, England, started producing an <b>aquavit</b> (termed 'Aqvavit' due to EU regulations) in 2017. In Canada <b>aquavit</b> is produced by Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery, and Island Spirits Distillery. Small distilleries in the United States also produce <b>aquavit,</b> especially in parts of the country with high populations of people of Nordic heritage, such as the distilleries in Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oregon and Washington.

5000|$|Peculiar to the Norwegian {{tradition}} are Linje Aquavits (such as [...] "Løiten Linje" [...] and [...] "Lysholm Linje"). Linje <b>Aquavit</b> {{is named}} after the tradition of sending oak barrels of <b>aquavit</b> with ships from Norway to Australia and back again, thereby passing the equator ("linje") twice before being bottled. The constant movement, high humidity and fluctuating temperature cause the spirit to extract more flavour and contributes to accelerated maturation.|$|E

50|$|The {{predominant}} {{kinds of}} schnapps until the mid of the 20th century were Köm, the northern German version of <b>Aquavit</b> or Korn (distilled from rye or wheat). The small island of Neuwerk in the North Sea, which is belongs to Hamburg, {{is famous for}} producing its own <b>Aquavit.</b> Especially the trade with South America brought Rum {{to the city and}} is featured in the Grog, a popular drink not only amongst seamen.|$|E

5000|$|The word <b>aquavit</b> {{is derived}} from Latin aqua vitae, [...] "water of life." [...] The word whisky {{is derived from}} uisge beatha, the Goidelic {{equivalent}} of this phrase. Likewise, clear fruit brandy is called [...] "eau de vie" [...] (French for [...] "water of life"). Similarly, vodka is derivative from the Russian word [...] "voda" [...] (water), in reference to vodka being the [...] "water of life." [...] An apocryphal story holds that <b>aquavit</b> actually means [...] "water from the vine," [...] a picturesque folk etymology derived through conflation of Latin vītae (genitive of vita) with the Italian vite (wine grapes - used as poetic synonymous with [...] "wine").|$|E
50|$|An inn {{opened in}} about 1800. On 22 May 1730, it {{received}} a royal license to brew its own beer and {{make its own}} <b>aquavit.</b> The inn keeper had to pay his tax to the king in cod.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aquavit</b> {{is seldom}} {{produced}} {{outside of the}} Nordic countries, although there are domestic imitations of it in some countries, especially in areas that have a large community of Nordic immigrants, such as the United States. An exception, however, is Northern Germany, {{and in particular the}} German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which was part of Denmark until the 19th century (see: History of Schleswig-Holstein) and still has a notable Danish minority. Among the most important German brands are Bommerlunder from Flensburg, Kieler Sprotte from Kiel and Malteserkreuz. The latter brand has been produced in Berlin since 1924 by a subsidiary of Sweden's Vin & Sprit AB (now Pernod Ricard), the producer of many Swedish akvavits, and can be considered a German imitation of the Nordic aquavits, since it is based on an original Danish recipe. Brands from Schleswig-Holstein, however, often have a long history, comparable to their Nordic counterparts. Bommerlunder, for instance, has been made since 1760. <b>Aquavit</b> is also {{an important part of the}} traditional cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein. German <b>aquavit</b> is virtually always distilled from fermented grain, and generally has an alcohol content of 38% alcohol by volume, marginally less than Scandinavian aquavits.|$|E
50|$|Gravet elg - {{sweet and}} salt cured moose: this {{treatment}} {{may be used}} for all red meat, but game and beef work best. It is the same procedure as for gravlaks, but brandy is often substituted with <b>aquavit,</b> and dill with juniper berries.|$|E
