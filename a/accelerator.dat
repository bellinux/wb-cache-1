5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle <b>accelerator,</b> {{which was designed to}} accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The <b>accelerator</b> was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the <b>accelerator</b> had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to <b>accelerator</b> physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle <b>accelerator</b> while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the <b>accelerator,</b> which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{returns to}} Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when {{she tries to}} arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the {{particle}} <b>accelerator,</b> but Davey reveals {{that he has been}} helping the government hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the particle <b>accelerator,</b> but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.|$|E

OpenHMPP directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an <b>accelerator</b> device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the <b>accelerator</b> memory.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{was alarmed}} by the Soviet Union's first nuclear test in August 1949. The proper response, he concluded, was an all-out effort to build a bigger nuclear weapon: the {{hydrogen}} bomb. Lawrence proposed to use accelerators instead of nuclear reactors to produce the neutrons needed to create the tritium the bomb required, as well as plutonium, which was more difficult, as much higher energies would be required. He first proposed the construction of Mark I, a prototype $7 million, 25 MeV linear <b>accelerator,</b> codenamed Materials Test <b>Accelerator</b> (MTA). He was soon talking about a new, even larger MTA known as the Mark II, which could produce tritium or plutonium from depleted uranium-238. Serber and Segré attempted in vain to explain the technical problems that made it impractical, but Lawrence {{felt that they were}} being unpatriotic.|$|E

In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received {{a gift from the}} American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water. The <b>accelerator</b> was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).|$|E

40|$|Abstract – With {{the rapid}} {{progress}} in semiconductor technologies, {{more and more}} <b>accelerators</b> can be integrated onto a single SoC chip. In SoCs, <b>accelerators</b> often require deterministic data access. However, {{as more and more}} applications are running simultaneous, latency can vary significantly due to contention. To address this problem, we propose a template-based memory access engine (MAE) for <b>accelerators</b> in SoCs. The proposed MAE can handle several common memory access patterns observed for near-future <b>accelerators.</b> Our evaluation results show that the proposed MAE can significantly reduce memory access latency and jitter, thus very effective for <b>accelerators</b> in SoCs.

5|$|What Lawrence {{needed to}} develop the idea was capable {{graduate}} students to do the work. Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's <b>accelerator</b> and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's linear <b>accelerator</b> was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E

40|$|Business <b>accelerators</b> {{are playing}} {{a key role in}} facilitating the process of new venture creation. Start-ups {{generally}} look for the best <b>accelerators</b> to make their long journey short. Media start-ups also look for a supportive mechanism to fasten their start-up experience. In this process, one of the main issues is to shorten their learning curve which is possible by use of start-up <b>accelerators.</b> Therefore, this chapter deals with the idea that which factors are important in this regard. To do so, first, a brief review of the support mechanisms is presented, and it is discussed that how start-up <b>accelerators</b> shorten the learning curve of the start-ups. Then, five media start-ups which were created in <b>accelerators</b> are studied. All of the cases were established after 2014, since the <b>accelerators</b> started working from the same year. According to the findings, there are mainly six reasons for shortening of the learning curve by start-up <b>accelerators,</b> including: (1) Short creation period, (2) Seminars and courses, (3) Co-working space, (4) Divided teams, (5) Cohort peers, and (6) Mentorship...|$|R
