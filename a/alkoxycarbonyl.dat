The complexes with R = Me and Et show 2 absorption bands centered at ca. 1650 cm- 1, which are probably due to conformational isomers with cis and trans geometry.

The 2 isomers may originate from different orientation of the <b>alkoxycarbonyl</b> ligand with respect to the asym. metal center, because of hindered rotation around the Pd-C bond due to the partial double bond character.
