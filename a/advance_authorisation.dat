25|$|The Irish War of Independence {{in effect}} {{began on the}} day that the First Dáil convened, 21 January 1919. On that date, an ambush party of IRA volunteers from the 3rd Tipperary Brigade {{including}} Séamus Robinson, Dan Breen, Seán Treacy and Seán Hogan, attacked a pair of Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men who were escorting a consignment of gelignite to a quarry in Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary. The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence. The engagement had no <b>advance</b> <b>authorisation</b> from the nascent government. However, Collins in Dáil discussion of the incident implicitly accepted responsibility on behalf of the IRB. The legislature's support for the armed struggle soon after became official.|$|E
40|$|This Report {{has been}} {{funded by the}} Joint Infrastructure Systems Committee (JISC) October 2005. Middleware, Practices and Outlook report was funded by JISC to explore the {{landscape}} of Grid security. The report summarises experiences of existing Grid middleware and practices today including Public Key Infrastructures and their limitations. A review of <b>advanced</b> <b>authorisation</b> technologies and developments within the Internet 2 community are also explored {{with regard to their}} potential impact upon Grid based e-Research.

40|$|We {{describe}} a more <b>advanced</b> <b>authorisation</b> infrastructure for identity management systems which {{in addition to}} the traditional Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP) has an application independent policy enforcement point (AIPEP), a credential validation service (CVS) and a master PDP. The AIPEP is responsible for handling sticky policies, calling the master PDP, performing application independent obligations, and validating credentials using the CVS. The master PDP is responsible for calling multiple traditional PDPs that support a variety of policy languages, and resolving conflicts between the various authorisation decisions. Whilst this authorisation infrastructure may seem more complex to implement, it is in fact easier for applications to integrate since nearly all of the complexity is hidden beneath the PEP interface...|$|R

The Grid paradigm provides a compelling model whereby seamless access to these resources can be achieved.

40|$|The {{development}} of teaching materials for future software engineers {{is critical to}} the long term success of the grid. At present however there is considerable turmoil in the grid community both within the standards and the technology base underpinning these standards. In this context, it is especially challenging to develop teaching materials that have some sort of lifetime beyond the next wave of grid middleware and standards. In addition, the current way in which grid security is supported and delivered has two key problems. Firstly {{in the case of the}} UK e-Science community, scalability issues arise from a central certificate authority. Secondly, the current security mechanisms used by the grid community are not line grained enough. In this paper we outline how these issues are being addressed through the {{development of}} a grid computing module supported by an <b>advanced</b> <b>authorisation</b> infrastructure at the University of Glasgow...|$|R
40|$|Security {{breaches}} occur due to system vulnerabilities {{with numerous}} reasons including; erro- neous design (human errors), management or implementation errors. Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses that allow an attacker {{to violate the}} integrity of a system. To address this, system administrators and security professionals typically employ tools to determine the existence of vulerabilities. Security breaches {{can be dealt with}} through reactive or proactive methods. Reactive approaches are passive, in which when a breach occurs, site administrators respond to provide damage control, tracking down how the attacker got in, resolving the vulnerability and fixing the system. On the other hand, proactive approaches preemptively discover and fix vulnerabilities in their systems and networks before attacks can occur. For many research and business areas, organizations need to collaborate with peers by sharing their resources (storage servers, clusters, databases etc). This is often achieved through formation of Virtual Organisations (VO). For successful operation of such endeavors, security is a key issue and system configuration is vital. A faulty or incomplete configuration of a given site can cause hinderances to their normal operation and indeed be a threat to the whole VO. Management of such infrastructures is complex since they should ideally address the overall configuration and management of a dynamic set of VO-specific resources across multiple sites, as well as configuration and management of the underlying infrastructure upon which the VO exists - referred to in this thesis as the fabric. This thesis investigates the feasibility of using a proactive approach towards detecting vulner- abilities across VO resources. First, it investigates whether vulnerability assessment tools can preemptively help in detecting fabric level weaknesses. Then it explores how the combina- tion of <b>advanced</b> <b>authorisation</b> infrastructures with configuration management tools can allow distributed site administrators to address the challenges associated with vulnerabilities. The primary contribution of this work is a novel approach for vulnerability management which addresses the specific challenges facing VO-wide security and incorporation of fabric man- agement security considerations...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{research}} can often have demands on finer-grained security {{that go beyond}} the authentication-only paradigm as typified by many e-Infrastructure/Grid based solutions. Supporting finer-grained access control is often essential for domains where the specification and subsequent enforcement of authorization policies is needed. The clinical domain is one area in particular where this is so. However {{it is the case}} that existing security authorization solutions are fragile, inflexible and difficult to establish and maintain. As a result they often do not meet the needs of real world collaborations where robustness and flexibility of policy specification and enforcement, and ease of maintenance are essential. In this paper we present results of the JISC funded <b>Advanced</b> Grid <b>Authorisation</b> through Semantic Technologies (AGAST) project (www. nesc. ac. uk/hub/projects/agast) and show how semantic-based approaches to security policy specification and enforcement can address many of the limitations with existing security solutions. These are demonstrated into the clinical trials domain through the MRC funded Virtual Organisations for Trials and Epidemiological Studies (VOTES) project (www. nesc. ac. uk/hub/projects/votes) and the epidemiological domain through the JISC funded SeeGEO projec...|$|R
2500|$|Scholars broadly {{agree that}} the Torah {{is a product of}} the mid-Persian period, {{approximately}} 450-400 BCE, although some place its final form somewhat later, in the Hellenistic era. Many theories have been advanced to explain its composition, but two have been especially influential. The first of these, Persian Imperial <b>authorisation,</b> <b>advanced</b> by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy. Frei's theory was deconstructed at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question. The second theory, sometimes called the [...] "Citizen-Temple Community", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it. The Torah (the Exodus story) served as an [...] "identity card" [...] defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions. Both explanations see the Exodus story as a [...] "charter myth" [...] for Israel, telling how Israel was delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belongs to him through the covenant.|$|R
