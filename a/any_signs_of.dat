5|$|The pottery {{found at}} the site were in {{an early stage of}} hand crafting, of the coarse variety, in steel-grey, dull red, brown, and buff colours with mat prints at the bottom; they were in the shape of bowl, vase and stem.

5|$|Both the Inspector and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E

5|$|When Bill Watts {{was ousted}} from his {{position}} in WCW in favor of Eric Bischoff, Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young Chris Benoit in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to help establish rising teams or give established teams opposition. Benoit and Eaton, while gelling in the ring, never showed <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> being presented as a permanent team; {{they did not have}} matching ring outfits or a team name.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E
5|$|PSA-NCAM {{appears as}} another candidate. Mice lacking NCAM show a {{dramatically}} size-reduced OB and {{an accumulation of}} migrating precursors along the RMS. It is possible that lack of NCAM results in agitation of neuron–glia interactions, and modifications in these interactions might in turn {{be responsible for the}} inhibition of migration in the RMS. It has been demonstrated that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells and data in favor of an active role of PSA–NCAM in this process has been presented. The lack of PSA–NCAM on the surface of migrating precursors might alter the proliferative properties of this glial cell population, a scenario that appears reminiscent of astrogliosis occurring in neurodegenerative diseases even before <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> neuronal damage.|$|E

5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was not {{searched for}} again until briefly in 1927 {{and again in}} October 1929, when five veteran {{collectors}} belonging to the Whitney South Seas Expedition dedicated three months to searching for the pigeon in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the pigeon was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of Rob Roy Island and Wagina off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist Shane A. Parker did not discover <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the pigeon. American scientist Jared Diamond searched for the bird in 1974 without success.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Dora {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off the western African coast on July7. The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> development. However, the system encountered an enhanced flow of moisture in the southwestern Caribbean, allowing for organization and the formation of a broad low-pressure area on July15. Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone. The next day, thunderstorm activity erupted around the system, and at 1500UTC on July18, the NHC declared the vigorous disturbance to have reached tropical depression status; in post-season analysis, the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941 the LRDG, {{now under}} {{command of the}} newly formed Eighth Army, moved from Kufra to Siwa (central Libya). The patrols were given the task of {{watching}} the desert tracks south of Jebel Akhdar and report <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements and withdrawals. 'R1' Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields {{to the west of}} Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines, later becoming the nucleus of the Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942. In early November 'T2' Patrol took four British officers to the Gebel and was to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of Operation Flipper, which had planned to kill General Rommel.|$|E

5|$|New {{orders were}} {{subsequently}} issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the Wehrmacht went {{from house to}} house over the next several days, arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E

5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|The further {{evolution}} of Callisto after accretion {{was determined by}} the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100km. Its presence would explain the lack of <b>any</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.|$|E
