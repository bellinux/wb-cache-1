5000|$|Commentators {{have criticized}} {{reliance}} on <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> to suggest unfairness towards the consumer. Edward A. Dauer {{said that the}} lowered costs of arbitration as compared to litigation may be more beneficial to businesses who tend to hire counsel at an hourly rate rather than consumers whose legal representation is subject to contingent fee agreements. Christopher R. Drahozal said that upfront arbitration costs should not affect the ability for consumers represented by lawyers on a contingent fee basis to bring claims in arbitration. [...] Stephen Ware {{said that it is}} erroneous to only compare <b>arbitration</b> forum <b>fees</b> with court fees because, he says, the entire cost of pursuing a claim in arbitration will likely be lower than the entire cost of pursuing a claim in litigation. Peter Rutledge criticized making a distinction between attorney's <b>fees</b> and <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees,</b> saying that, overall, they both represent out-of-pocket expenses for a consumer.|$|R
50|$|Other {{commentators}} {{disagree with}} the argument that post-dispute arbitration agreements would be rare. Thomas E. Carbonneau wrote that businesses could offer incentives to entice consumers to arbitrate a dispute after it arises; such incentives may include paying all of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees,</b> automatically awarding the consumer party a fraction of its attorney's fees, and having an award for the business reduced by a set proportion.|$|R

5000|$|The National <b>Arbitration</b> Forum {{assessed}} <b>fees</b> {{based on}} the size of the claim, according to a published fee schedule. According to the 2008 fee schedule, consumers claiming less than $75,000 were charged filing fees of $19 (for a claim of $1,500 or less) to $242 (for claims valued from $55,000 to $74,999), plus a $20 fee for each objection, a $100 fee to submit a post-hearing memorandum or a request for an explained decision, and up to $250 for a participatory hearing. [...] For larger claims, the NAF charged higher fees, including fees for making requests to the arbitrator or the NAF. [...] Sarah R. Cole and Kristen M. Blankley said that many contracts have different arrangements for who pays the <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees,</b> so consumers often paid less than the amount listed in the NAF fee schedule. Cole and Blankley said that, in the data set of about 34,000 cases studied, there were only five cases where a consumer paid more than $500 in arbitration fees; in all of those cases, the consumer brought a claim and was represented by counsel.|$|R
5000|$|Both the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and JAMS have {{criteria}} that a pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreement must satisfy {{as a condition}} of the organization agreeing to administer the arbitration. [...] Examples include the right for the consumer to be represented by an attorney, the right for a consumer to pursue a claim in small claims court, caps on the <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> charged to a consumer, requirements that arbitration hearings take place at a location convenient for the consumer, and the right to demand a written explanation of the arbitrator's award. The AAA adopted its Consumer Due Process Protocol in 1998. Timothy Jost wrote that consumer advocates [...] "voiced hope other ADR providers would adopt" [...] the protocol and that the AARP supported it.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009, the Searle Civil Justice Institute {{published}} {{an analysis of}} consumer cases in AAA resulting in an award from April to December 2007. [...] According to the analysis, consumer claimants seeking less than $10,000 paid an average of $1 in administrative fees and $95 in arbitrator fees, while consumer claimants seeking at least $10,000 but {{less than or equal}} to $75,000 paid an average of $15 in administrative fees and $204 in arbitrator fees. Consumer claimants seeking more than $75,000 paid an average of $1,448 in administrative fees and $1,256 in arbitrator fees. However, the report also says that because only awarded cases were considered, there may be a selection bias in that awarded cases are those where <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> did not prevent consumers from pursuing their claims in arbitration.|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} reports {{filed by the}} American Arbitration Association (AAA) {{pursuant}} to California Code requirements, this article examines outcomes of employment arbitration. The study analyzes 3, 945 arbitration cases, of which 1, 213 were decided by an award after a hearing, filed and reaching disposition between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007. This includes all the employment arbitration cases administered nationally by the AAA during this time period that derived from employer-promulgated arbitration procedures. Key findings include: (1) the employee win rate amongst the cases was 21. 4 %, which is lower than employee win rates reported in employment litigation trials; (2) in cases won by employees, the median award amount was $ 36, 500 and the mean was $ 109, 858, {{both of which are}} substantially lower than award amounts reported in employment litigation; (3) mean time to disposition in arbitration was 284. 4 days for cases that settled and 361. 5 days for cases decided after a hearing, which is substantially shorter than times to disposition in litigation; (4) mean <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> were $ 6, 340 per case overall, $ 11, 070 for cases disposed of by an award following a hearing, and in 97 percent of these cases the employer paid 100 percent of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> beyond a small filing fee, pursuant to AAA procedures; (5) in 82. 4 percent of the cases, the employees involved made less than $ 100, 000 per year; and (6) the mean amount claimed was $ 844, 814 and 75 percent of all claims were greater than $ 36, 000. The study also analyzes whether there is a repeat player effect in employer arbitration. The results provide strong evidence of a repeat employer effect in which employee win rates and award amounts are significantly lower where the employer is involved in multiple arbitration cases, which could be explained by various advantages accruing to larger organizations with greater resources and expertise in dispute resolution procedures. The results also indicate the existence of a significant repeat employer-arbitrator pairing effect in which employees on average have lower win rates and receive smaller damage awards where the same arbitrator is involved in more than one case with the same employer, a finding supporting some of the fairness criticisms directed at mandatory employment arbitration...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the {{predictions}} of conventional economic theory, firms often benefit by increasing consumer transaction costs. Firms do so by, for example, obscuring contract terms {{in a variety of}} ways, such as providing them after the contract is agreed to, enclosing them with other more interesting information, using small print, and omitting important terms such as <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> from the written contract. Firms also benefit by taking advantage of predictable consumer behaviors, such as the tendency of consumers not to seek rebates, to overload when provided with too much information, and to ignore dull information when overshadowed by vivid information. Using behavioral law and economics, this Article provides examples of practices that inflate consumer transaction costs, explains why firms benefit from such practices, and describes the conditions giving rise to such practices. This Article also explains why inflated consumer transaction costs are objectionable and explores the law 2 ̆ 7 s response to the problem. Finally, the Article argues that lawmakers should adopt a norm barring the unnecessary inflation of consumer transaction costs and describes tests that lawmakers can employ to implement such a norm...|$|R
5000|$|According to Ramona L. Lampley, {{the first}} {{generation}} of consumer arbitration clauses was characterized by drafters including not only class action waivers but also damages limitations, bars on recovery of attorney fees, requirements that consumers pay half or all of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees,</b> confidentiality requirements on the parties to an arbitration, or allowing the business to unilaterally select the arbitrator, all of which were found unenforceable by some court. [...] In August 1999, Consumer Reports cited a then-superseded arbitration clause by Gateway where a consumer would have to pay $2,000 to file a claim, would have to mail the claim to a Paris address, and would have to travel to Chicago for arbitration hearings. [...] However, in 2001, Christopher R. Drahozal wrote that [...] "unfair arbitration clauses" [...] are less prevalent than thought, and that even unfair terms could be beneficial to the contracting parties. [...] In 2001, Stephen Ware suggested that requiring consumer protections in arbitration (requiring the availability of class proceedings, applying a universal cap on consumer fees without a case-by-case determination of whether the consumer can afford those fees, [...] "requiring substantial discovery", or requiring businesses and consumers to arbitrate the same types of claims) would increase the costs of dispute resolution for the business, which would raise prices.|$|R
5000|$|The Arbitration Law {{provides}} that arbitration and arbitration commissions should be independent and free from interference by administration organs, public organizations, or individuals. While the government played an instrumental {{role in the}} founding and initial organization of the BAC, and the BMG appoints BAC personnel, the organization is effectively independent. Today, the appointment of personnel by the BMG functions as a formality. First, the stringent qualifications required for personnel {{set out in the}} Arbitration Law limits the BMG's discretion in appointing personnel. Only specified departments and organizations may recommend candidates and the BMG never vetoes the recommendations. Second, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman by designation may hold meetings of the Commission only if two-thirds of the Members are present. Any revisions of the BAC Constitution or dissolution of the BAC require the approval of {{more than two-thirds of the}} Commission Members. Other resolutions require the approval of more than two-thirds of the Commission Members present at the meeting. The decision-making process minimizes the ability of a government-appointed Commission Members from compromising the Commission's independence. Third, the BAC achieved financial independence from the government in 1998 and currently operates as a public institution [...] "managed as an enterprise." [...] Within the first three years after its creation, the BAC's caseload increased dramatically, providing the BAC with a stable source of funding from <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees.</b> The BAC has been self-funded since 2002. Fourth, the BMG has taken a [...] "hands-off approach" [...] in its strong support of the BAC. The BMG's involvement is limited to providing the BAC with necessary financial assistance, allowing the BAC to operate independently.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} estimate for construction was £17,000 (2011 $4,564,500), however in late July 1840, {{one month after}} construction began, the plans were altered by Governor George Gawler. Although all the foundations had been laid the new plans halved the building work, which effectively reduced the contract cost to £10,000 although this {{did not include the}} cost of work already completed. In October, Gawler again altered the plans by now including the gaoler's house he had earlier dropped from the original plans, added two more towers and increased the quality of the stonework by specifying ashlar which cost fifty percent more than the wrought stone specified in the original contract. These new alterations added £9,000 to the cost. By March 1841 the goal was nearing completion, the builders Borrow and Goodiar had already received £l0,950 and they now requested a further £8,733 which Gawler refused. The dispute resulted in the claim being arbitrated in court and the arbitrators requested an independent valuation of the work completed.In May, Gawler was replaced by George Grey who accused Gawler of acting [...] "under no authority whatever". Gawler denied responsibility for the work and blamed Kingston. Kingston himself claimed the work was authorised by the Board of Works who denied even inspecting the site despite evidence they did so weekly. As Gawler had kept no documentation whatsoever regarding the contract it could not be determined who was responsible and Kingston's appointment was later terminated on 4 August, six days after the gaol was completed. In early September the valuation was completed with the value of work estimated at more than £32,000 above the sum already paid, which the court awarded to Borrow and Goodiar. On 5 November the builders submitted a claim for the £32,000 plus interest, commission, legal costs and <b>arbitration</b> <b>fees</b> of more than £4,000 (2011: $9,666,000 in total). Grey refused and threatened to put the case before the British Government. In February 1842 Grey commissioned another valuation that presented a revised valuation of £19,650 (2011: $5,276,000) based solely on the original plans, which was offered to the builders. It was initially declined but accepted following pressure from the Bank of South Australia with whom Borrow and Goodiar had an £11,000 (2011: $2,954,000) overdraft. By the end of 1842 both of the colonies newspapers had taken up the cause in favour of the builders and a memorial was presented to the Secretary of the Colonies in Britain, demanding that the arbitration decision be honoured or put before a jury trial. The sum was reluctantly paid, although the actual construction costs still resulted in the builders declaring bankruptcy.|$|R

40|$|The {{national}} statutes {{on international}} commercial arbitration, the leges arbitri, do, as a rule, not contain provisions on costs. In the final award, an arbitrator has {{to determine the}} costs of the <b>arbitration</b> (the <b>fees</b> of the arbitral tribunals, of expert witnesses mandated by the arbitral tribunal etc.), which cost incurred by the parties during the arbitration are recoverable and which party has to bear what share of the costs. A decision on these issues forms part of the ordinary course of an arbitration. Further cost-related issues may arise due to the peculiarities of the case, such as a refusal of one of the parties to contribute to the financing of the arbitration. Resorting to agreements may provide a satisfactory means for certain decisions on costs in arbitration proceedings; this is by making use of the contractual nature of these agreements; by asking whether these agreements can be interpreted in a way that gives an answer to the issue at stake or - {{as in the case of}} security for costs - whether the contract may be amended to grant a motion for security for costs. It is submitted that the reasoning so achieved is at least as convincing and consistent as other approaches solicited by doctrine. Therefore, it is further submitted that this approach should be considered when an issue arises that is not addressed in the lex arbitri or the institutional arbitration rules...|$|R
