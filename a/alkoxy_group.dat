25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group.</b> The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E

40|$|Silica spheres {{that are}} {{prepared}} by the Stöber process are usually considered non-porous. Here we report on a slightly modified synthesis protocol that allows preparation of microporous Stöber particles. Successive treatment with water and alcohol at room temperature results in substantial reorganization of the silica within the Stöber particles. Hydrolysis of <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> as well as condensation and re-esterification of silanol groups upon re-immersion in alcohol are crucial for that process. As {{the result of the}} silica reorganization, micropore channels are formed within the particles.

40|$|Novel polyimide-silica nanocomposites with {{interphase}} chemical bonding {{have been}} prepared using the sol-gel process. The morphology, thermal and mechanical properties were studied {{as a function of}} silica content and compared with the similar composites having no interphase interaction. The polyimide precursors, polyamic acids (PAAs) with or without pendant hydroxyl groups were prepared from the reaction of pyromellitic dianhydride with a mixture of oxydianiline and 1, 3 phenylenediamine or 2, 4 -diminophenol in dimethylacetamide. The PAA with pendant hydroxyl groups was reacted with isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane to produce <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on the chain. The reinforcement of PAA matrices with or without <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on the chain was carried out by mixing appropriate amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and carrying out its hydrolysis and condensation in a sol-gel process. Thin hybrid films were imidized by successive heating up to 300 C∘. The presence of <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on the polymer chain and their cocondensation with TEOS developed the silica network which was interconnected chemically with the polyimide matrix. SEM studies show a drastic decrease in the silica particle size in the chemically bonded system.

These groups are further condensed in many applications, to give highly crosslinked, insoluble polysiloxane networks.|$|E
50|$|Ordinarily the {{nitrogen}} atom in the amine group is reacting as a nucleophile {{by way of}} its lone pair. This polarity can be reversed when a primary or secondary amine is substituted with a good leaving group (such as a halogen atom or an <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group).</b> The resulting N-substituted compound can behave as an electrophile at {{the nitrogen}} atom and react with a nucleophile as for example in the electrophilic amination of carbanions.|$|E

Phenyl methyl dimenthoxy silane was synthesized from dichloromethylphenysilane using lithium menthoxide in good yield. Mono-substitution of the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> by butyl lithium was studied for both enantiomers of menthol, and yielded modest enantiomeric excess. Mono-substitution of the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on phenyl methyl di-(-) -menthoxy silane by tert butyl lithium was also observed, and displayed high enantiomeric excess.

An ethoxy group (CH3CH2O-) {{is found in}} the organic compound ethyl phenyl ether, C6H5OCH2CH3 which is also known as ethoxybenzene. Related to alkoxy groups are aryloxy groups, which have an aryl group singular bonded to oxygen such as the phenoxy group (C6H5O-).|$|E
50|$|Esters are {{the most}} famous {{synthetics}} in Group V, which are 100% Synthetic chemical compounds consisting of a carbonyl adjacent to an ether linkage.

50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism for an oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde {{according to the}} so-called hypervalent twisting mechanism involves a ligand exchange reaction replacing the hydroxyl group by the alcohol followed by a twist and an elimination reaction. The twist is a requirement because the iodine to oxygen double bond is oriented out of plane with the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> and the concerted elimination {{would not be able}} to take place. This twist reaction is a rearrangement in which the oxygen atom is moved into a proper plane for a 5 membered cyclic transition state in the elimination reaction and is calculated by Computational chemistry to be the rate-determining step in the oxidation. The twist mechanism also explains why oxidation is faster for larger alcohols than for small alcohols. The twist is driven forward by the steric hindrance that exists between the ortho hydrogen atom and the protons from the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> and larger alkoxy groups create larger steric repulsion. The same computation predicts a much faster reacting IBX derivative with a 100 fold reaction rate when this ortho hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl group thus facilitating the twist until the elimination reaction takes prevalence as the rate determining step.|$|E
40|$|Organically {{modified}} siloxanes or silicates are hybrid materials which intrinsically combine {{properties and}} functions of inorganic materials, for instance glass, with those of organic polymers.
