5000|$|Early in his career, Bronson gained {{recognition}} for lyrically and stylistically resembling fellow New York rapper Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan (with whom he collaborated, along with {{friend and fellow}} rapper Termanology, on a song called [...] "Meteor Hammer", from the 2011 compilation album Legendary Weapons). Ghostface Killah himself has admitted to confusing Bronson's rapping for his own. In an interview with HipHopDX, Bronson was asked {{about how it was}} to be compared to the Wu-Tang rapper, and he responded with, [...] Yeah, I mean {{at the end of the}} day, it's <b>all</b> <b>good</b> <b>because</b> Ghostface Killah is one of the best rappers alive, so if I sound similar to the best rapper alive then that is fine. To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be Kool G Rap, he is the person I look up to the most. I am not upset but at the end of the day I am my own person and no one can take that away from me.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Evolutionary {{adaptation}} {{will help}} some animals cope with future climate change, but for juvenile salmon {{there may be}} limits to how far the thermal tolerance of cardiac function can adapt. Which animal populations will persist in a future warmer world depends, in part, {{on their ability to}} adapt to higher temperatures. As the world warms, populations can move to track preferred temperatures, they may acclimate to warmer temperatures through phenotypic plasticity, or they may become better suited to the new environment through evolutionary adaptation. There are many examples of how projected future temperatures could dramatically affect the performance {{of a wide range of}} different plant and animal species, but whether these species will adapt over the longer term is largely unknown, especially in aquatic environments. Writing in Nature Climate Change, Muñoz et al. show that physiological traits important to the survival of juvenile chinook salmon have both plasticity and genetic potential to adapt to warmer temperatures. However, the news is not <b>all</b> <b>good,</b> <b>because</b> one key trait — the upper thermal limit for heart function — appears to lack plasticity or significant genetic variation. As a result chinook populations face an increasing risk of catastrophic population loss if river temperatures continue to warm...|$|E

As this article will show, there is surprisingly little evidence to support this claim, at least for the U.

In general, studies that suggest important mortality improvements from coverage expansion have more methodological problems than those that show negligible improvements.

60|$|But is there, therefore, no need at <b>all</b> of <b>good</b> works, <b>because</b> {{a man is}} {{justified}} before God without them? or can that be called a justifying faith, that has not for its fruit good works? (Job 22:3; James 2:20, 26) Verily good works are necessary, though God need them not; nor is that faith, as to justification with God, worth a rush, that abideth alone, or without them.|$|R
60|$|Ans. By this supposition, faith justifieth not by {{receiving}} of the righteousness that Christ {{by himself}} accomplished for sinners; but by falling in with <b>all</b> <b>good</b> works, which <b>because</b> they cannot be known, much less done, by the soul at first, his faith being then, {{as to the}} perfection of knowledge of duties, weak, he standeth still before God unjustified, and so must stand until he doth comply with all those purposes of Christ's coming into the world.|$|R

5000|$|The Mercury Wonder Show ran August 3-September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent {{located at}} 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, {{in the heart}} of Hollywood. The brand-new, two-pole Big Top offered 1,100 {{bleacher}} seats — all of them free — to service members. In the center were 400 folding chairs for the public, with tickets priced at $1.65 to $5.50 for adults and 55 cents for children. For opening night only, the public seats were $5.50 and $11. Charity-minded Hollywood celebrities could pay $30 (the equivalent of $ today) for one of the 25 to 30 seats in the sucker section; it cost $50 or $100 for one of the two super-sucker seats nailed down directly behind the massive tent poles.

They are clothed, but not warmly or cheerfully. But they are naked of families, relationships, homes, values and, in most cases, jobs. They exist in modern Britain with few possessions except their words." [...] He praised the directing, noting: [...] "Leigh's method has created in Naked a group of characters who {{could not possibly have}} emerged from a conventional screenplay; {{this is the kind of}} film that is beyond imagining, and only observation could have created it." [...] He concluded: [...] "This is a painful movie to watch. But it is also exhilarating, as <b>all</b> <b>good</b> movies are, <b>because</b> we are watching the director and actors venturing beyond any conventional idea of what a modern movie can be about. Here there is no plot, no characters to identify with, no hope.

2500|$|Kant thinks that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the <b>good</b> will, <b>all</b> <b>goods</b> are qualified. By qualified, Kant means that those goods are good insofar as they presuppose or derive their goodness from something else. Take wealth as an example. Wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, but we certainly would not take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. The good will, by contrast, is good in itself. [...] Kant writes, “A good will is not <b>good</b> <b>because</b> of what it effects or accomplishes, because of its fitness to attain some proposed end, but only because its volition, that is, it is good initself [...] [...] [...] [...]” (4:394) The precise nature of the good will is subject to scholarly debate.|$|R
