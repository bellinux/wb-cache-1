40|$|This {{article is}} a {{comparative}} review of current depreciation practices in France and the United Kingdom. It starts with {{a consideration of the}} evolution of depreciation from the nineteenth century, when it was generally regarded as an optional item, often associated with profit-smoothing, through to the present day when the principle of its systematic application is never questioned. The article reviews the different regulatory frameworks controlling depreciation in France and the UK and notes the importance in France of the link with <b>allowable</b> <b>expenses</b> for tax purposes. From this analysis is drawn a series of recognition and measurement differences where the approach to depreciation is different between the two countries. Major differences are the use of residual values in the UK and their absence in France, the use of different asset categories, and different definitions for some assets. The paper then provides the results of empirical work where samples of accounts drawn from specific industry sectors are examined for evidence of actual practice. The paper concludes in observing that the research demonstrates many of the classical problems of cross-border analysis in that even a topic thought of as routine, such as depreciation, shows national differences of approach both as to asset categorization, and measurement of depreciation, so that direct comparisons are not entirely justified. ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1934, {{discussion}} of the transport policy in Dover resulted in {{the decision by the}} Tramways Committee to run tram services until 31 March 1936 and to promote a bill for the introduction of Corporation bus services within the borough. The East Kent Road Car Company Ltd. had offered to assist with the provision of bus services in the borough. The Council referred the decision back to the Committee asking for details of East Kent’s terms. In October 1934, the Council asked for expert opinion from the General Manager of Birmingham Corporation’s Tramways and Omnibus Department, Arthur Chantrey Baker. Three options were to be considered; reconditioning the tramways, the offer from East Kent, and provision of bus services by the Corporation. The result was that East Kent was to provide buses within the borough, with the Corporation receiving 75% of the profits after certain <b>allowable</b> <b>expenses</b> were deducted. The Corporation was free of any liability {{in the event of a}} loss being incurred by East Kent. The final trams ran on 31 December 1936, nine months later than was originally planned. The open-top trams were scrapped at River by burning them. The covered trams were disposed of by contract. It is believed that they too were scrapped in this way.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to a longstanding tradition in accounting research which attempts to understand accounting within its social and historical context. The topic of this historical narrative is the creation and role of accounting {{in the formation of the}} electricity industry in the US between 1882 until 1944. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first part we examine how early electrical engineers struggled to understand the nature and behavior of the costs of generating and distributing electricity at the turn of the 19 th Century. In doing so, these engineers established a relationship between costs and the engineering concepts of load factor and diversity and developed pricing structures which would recover both standing (fixed) and running (variable) costs. In the second phase, we examine how this accounting knowledge was deployed by early "inventor entrepreneurs" and businessmen in their attempts to dominate the early electric markets in the US and how investor owned regulated utilities emerged out of these strategies as a uniquely North American institution. In the final phase, we examine how accounting became the center of intense conflict between regulatory commissions and investor owned utilities in the US court system - including the Supreme Court - as representatives of these entities vied with each other over the chart of accounts, <b>allowable</b> <b>expenses,</b> the valuation of assets and depreciation. Here we contend that utility accounting did not simply grow to reflect a regulatory process but rather worked to shape utility regulation in the US. In 1944 a legal ruling displaced the primacy of accounting in the regulatory process and shifted its focus from asset valuation to rate of return determination. The space once dominated by accountants was ceded to regulatory economists. After that, accounting became taken-for-granted and matter-of-fact. ...|$|R

40|$|In the Polish {{tax system}} {{conditions}} wide possibilities of choosing {{the form of}} tax burdens have been reserved especially for natural persons running a business. A smooth switching over from one form into another is also possible, obviously not only in pursuance of tax provisions but also taking into consideration one’s own benefit from the change of taxation form. By choosing a taxation form the following elements should also be taken into account: organizational and legal form of tax payer’s business, place of running a business, kind, object, amount of taxation, abatements, exemptions and the way of documenting economic occurrences. The tax payer who is making a choice should analyse the dependence which may take place between the anticipated profitability in the economic business carried on and the particular taxation form. He should also analyse anticipated proceeds and eventual deductions, influence {{on the amount of}} <b>allowable</b> <b>expenses</b> and assess the degree of arduousness the tax payer must bear while keeping recording facilities, which are required with different forms used in the taxation. To summarize, tax lump sums can be a preferential taxation form in relation to general principles, but only for some groups of tax payers especially of minor businesses (often limited by the number of perons employed or by the amount quota of turnover) who show in their economic activity a tendency of gaining proportionally “large” income, revenues to “small” costs in the sphere of running a business. The circle of lax payers entitled {{to make use of the}} simplified taxation principles is broadly defined in view of the object categories of the kind of business run. In the last couple of years, however, a tendency of leaving this form of taxation and adopting general principles by tax payers has been observable. It is connected with the fact of disseminating exemptions from the income and value added taxes. The fact of establishing a due tax duty in advance and not after the tax year completed or the fact of relief taxation in a particular business is more and more of minor importance for tax payers. A steadily increasing number of institutions rendering a professional service as far as tax documentation of tax payer is concerned, can also constitute the encouragement to adjust general principles. Only in individual forms of running a typical craftsman business it can be of interest to tax payers, provided this way of running a business is competitive in relation to other economic subjects functioning on the market.

In her presentation to the Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, Dr Mirdha said, [...] "Ideally, all 900 or so molecules being marketed should be brought under price control, as partial control will not be effective since manufacturers freely migrate from price-controlled drugs to those outside price control. She added that prices of all patented and monopoly drugs should also be fixed.It is noted that for any price-controlled drug, all alternative medicines used in the treatment of the same disease should be regulated to prevent companies from shifting to decontrolled medicines as a way of escaping price control. According to her, a profit of maximum <b>allowable</b> post-manufacturing <b>expenses</b> of 200 per cent or 300 per cent should be given to the industry the price fixation mechanism should be less intrusive.Acting on a report by a sub-committee of which Jyoti Mirdha was the convenor, the Parliamentary Committee also alleged lapses and corruption in the process of drug approvals. It accused several frontline companies and hauled up the lead drug regulator.strong policy positions on price control of drugs, mandatory rules and penalties to govern the company-doctor relationship and control over foreign investment in Indian companies have often been termed as targeting industry players.In the Parliament she has also raised the issue of tractor owners across the country. In the 2012-2013 Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the Central Government had taken tractors out from the agricultural category {{and put them in the}} commercial category. This increased the annual insurance premium on farmers from 300 per cent to 800 per cent- the figure varying [...] For instance, a farmer in Rajasthan had to shell out Rs 10902 a year as insurance as compared to the earlier figure of Rs 1350. In Punjab, the farmers the insurance amount scaled up to Rs 22000 as against the earlier sum of Rs 8000. Dr Mirdha took up the matter with the Finance ministry and urged to reverse the [...] "anti-farmer" [...] policy decision. Minister of State for Finance Namonarayan Meena supported Dr Mirdha and took up the issue further with the Finance minister and IRDA chairman J Narayan. The IRDA chairman passed an executive order reversing the earlier decision. The quiet roll back was made even before Pranab Mukherjee addressed the Lok Sabha on Finance Bill. The order was promulgated from retrospective effect.In 2010, Dr Mirdha also expressed concern on the alleged inducement of doctors by the pharmaceutical industry with gifts and hospitality. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family welfare, of which she was the member, had noted that such a practice continued because the Medical Council of India had no jurisdiction over the Pharma industry and it could not enforce the code of ethics. Jyoti Mirdha's activism over the issue spurred the Government into action. She dispatched a bunch of air tickets to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to substantiate the claim that doctors and their families were enjoying summer trips to countries like England and Scotland, courtesy a pharmaceutical company.As many as 30 family members of 11 doctors from all over the country had reportedly enjoyed the industry's hospitality. The letter and the air tickets, which Dr Mirdha sent to the PMO was evidence of the junketeering.Jyoti Mirdha in her letter to the Prime Minister stated that the malpractice continued because even though a mandatory code made it illegal for doctors to accept [...] "favours" [...] from the pharmaceutical industry, there was no such deterrent for the industry from offering incentives to medical practitioners. This often resulted in ingenious methods being employed to flout the code.|$|R
