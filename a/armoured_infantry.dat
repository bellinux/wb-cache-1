His unit captured the Hillman Battery, a 12-bunker complex defended by 150 {{men of the}} 736 Infantry Regiment, {{as part of the}} liberation of Colleville-sur-Orne. They then fought during the Battle for Caen, and on 28 June were part of Operation Charnwood, fighting a battle at Château de la Londe, which left 161 dead on the British side. His company liberated Flers and moved on towards Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly <b>armoured</b> <b>infantry,</b> usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E

5|$|For {{operational}} tasks {{the most}} common unit is the battlegroup, formed around a combat unit and supported by units (or sub-units) from other areas. An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of <b>armoured</b> <b>infantry</b> (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example {{it would be the}} 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|These systems {{produced}} {{relatively large}} numbers of poorly <b>armoured</b> <b>infantry,</b> often armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill. There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of 15½ to 18½ feet in the later 15th century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, {{but this does not}} appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early 16th century. There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield. Archers became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the 15th century to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the Garde Écossaise. Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E

50|$|The naming {{conventions}} of the Canadian Army can be confusing. Regular Force <b>armoured</b> and <b>infantry</b> units are not usually named for a location, because personnel are drawn from across the country.

Reserve <b>armoured</b> and <b>infantry</b> units generally are named, and may carry a number if it has historical significance. In wartime, units raised for the duration often are numbered.|$|R

25|$|Naming {{conventions}} of units differ for traditional British historical reasons, creating a significant opportunity for confusion; an infantry battalion {{is equivalent to}} a cavalry regiment. An infantry regiment is an administrative and ceremonial organisation only, and may include several battalions. For operational tasks, a battle group will be formed around a combat unit, supported by units or sub-units from other areas. An example would be a squadron of tanks attached to an <b>armoured</b> <b>infantry</b> battle group, together with a reconnaissance troop, artillery battery and engineering support.|$|E
25|$|The only active units {{immediately}} {{available in}} an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts.

Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one selfpropelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.|$|E

25|$|The 4th Brigade is a brigade-level {{formation}} of the Australian Army. Originally formed in September 1914 for service during World War I, elements of the brigade served at Gallipoli and in the trenches on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. In 1921, the brigade was re-raised as a unit of Australia's part-time military forces, based {{in the state of}} Victoria. During World War II the brigade served in the New Guinea and New Britain campaigns. Following the war, the brigade formed part of the 3rd Division, however, it was later reallocated to the 2nd Division, where it serves as a Reserve combined-arms formation including units and personnel from all corps of the Army including <b>armoured,</b> <b>infantry,</b> artillery, engineers, signals and ordnance.|$|E

25|$|In the Dutch armed forces, the Colour is orange (except for {{the colour}} of the midshipsmans' corps, which is red). On the obverse is the royal cypher of the monarch {{that gave the}} {{regiment}} its (original) colour, with the unit's name underneath, both in gold; around the four edges is a laurel branch. On the reverse is {{the arms of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands without the mantle. The shield is blue and is strewn with small upright rectangles; the main device is a crowned rampant lion, holding a sword in its upper paw. The lion and rectangles are gold, whilst the blade of the sword is silver. Supporting the shield on either side is a gold rampant lion, facing outwards towards the viewer. There is a gold crown above the shield; whilst below it is a blue scroll with the motto Je Maintiendrai in gold. The shield and lions are surrounded by a wreath of green palm and oak leaves, and there is another wavy gold laurel wreath around the edge. Battle honours are added in the corners of the obverse; if additional honours are awarded, they are placed on streamers that are attached to the pike until the presentation of a new Colour. The Military Order of William or other decorations are attached to the pike when awarded. The pike has a finial of a lion on a block holding a sword and a bunch of seven arrows. Traditionally a colour is 87cm x 87cm (with a pike of 2.50 m in length), but <b>armoured</b> <b>infantry</b> regiments carry colours that measure 60cm x 60cm (with a pike of 2.20 m in length). Guards regiments carry the same colour, with some differing details.|$|E

[...] On 19 April, the first XVIII Mountain Corps troops entered Larissa and took possession of the airfield, where the British had left their supply dump intact. The seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled the spearhead units to continue without ceasing. The port of Volos, at which the British had re-embarked numerous units during the prior few days, fell on 21 April; there, the Germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil.|$|E
