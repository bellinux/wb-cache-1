40|$|<b>Application</b> <b>systems</b> that utilize {{recognition}} {{technologies such}} as speech, gesture, and color recognition provide human-machine interfacing to those users that are physically unable to interact with computers through traditional input devices such as mouse or keyboard. Current solutions to interface <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> with recognizers, however, use an ad hoc approach and lack of a generic and systematic way. The common approach used is to interface with recognizers through low-level programmed wrappers that are application dependent and require the details of system design and programming knowledge to perform the interfacing and to make any modifications to it. Thus, a generic and systematic approach to bridge the interface between recognizers and <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> must be quested. In this research work, we provide a generic and visual interfacing framework for bridging the interface between <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> and recognizers through the <b>application</b> <b>system’s</b> front end, applying a visual level interfacing without requiring the detailed system design and programming knowledge, allowing for modifications to an interfacing environment {{to be made on}} the fly and more importantly allowing the interfacing wit...|$|R

40|$|The World Wide Web {{has become}} an {{environment}} for distributed applications of all kinds. The originally intended use of the Web as distributed system for knowledge-interchange seems to disappear, compared to {{the increasing number of}} electronic commerce Web applications. Organizations offer products and services in the Web, and use the Web as a means to integrate their (heterogeneous) business <b>application</b> <b>systems.</b> Offering Web-based products requires combining services of different <b>application</b> <b>systems,</b> which were built on the coarse-grained Web implementation model. Reusing the respective fine-grained services and <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> respectively integrating these cross-platform <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> increases quality and reduces costs of the new product. However, communication between (legacy) business <b>application</b> <b>systems</b> has to be ensured on an abstract level to realize this scenario. The Web as a global point of sale seems to be very promising but obviously suffers from its heritage – the coarse-grained implementation model. We introduce a generic integration layer that uses an object-oriented approach as well as the WebComposition Markup Language to facilitate the reuse of code and design, and show how inter-application communication can be provided by means of an additional basic integration layer.

25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an <b>application</b> <b>system</b> where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step <b>application</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
