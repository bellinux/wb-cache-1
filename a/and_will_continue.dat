Users of the Windows Insider program receive occasional updates to newer preview builds of the operating system <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> {{to be able to}} evaluate preview releases after general availability (GA) in July 2015this is in contrast to previous Windows beta programs, where public preview builds were released less frequently and only during the months preceding GA. Windows Insider builds continued being released after the release to manufacturing (RTM) of Windows10.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E

5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve their capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to be upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins in}} their {{hometown}} of Pallet Town. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them alone {{can be very}} dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E

Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds have returned to the planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When asked how he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to cool almost indefinitely, {{eventually}} {{to become a}} black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, {{it is thought that}} in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E
