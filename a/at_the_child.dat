5|$|The inquiry was {{launched}} on 31 May 2001, and was {{split into two}} phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, {{in the form of}} hearings. Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

25|$|Zucker became {{interested}} in gender identity after reading Richard Green's 1974 book Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults. Zucker's graduate work in developmental psychology resulted in his master's thesis on normative gender identity development in children. While in graduate school, Zucker met his future collaborator, Susan J. Bradley, a child psychiatrist on staff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Child</b> and Adolescent Service of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry (now the Child and Family Studies Centre of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health), a public mental health centre and teaching hospital of the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.|$|E
500|$|Research on {{acquisition}} of pronouns in ASL {{has shown that}} children do not always {{take advantage of the}} iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun [...] "you", the iconicity of the point (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>child)</b> is often confused, being treated more like a name. This is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs.|$|E
500|$|Shankar did {{not support}} the idea in the initial script that {{there was some sort of}} Homonuclear {{molecule}} within DNA <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> stage of development that could be reverted to. He described the concept as [...] "silly", and insisted that it was not used. He later explained that the [...] "problem was that it was virtually impossible to come up with a sensible explanation and so we kind of did a lot of hand waving on this episode". The use of the term RVN was only created after executive producer Rick Berman requested something similar to DNA. Regarding the method in which the characters were restored to adulthood, he said [...] "Let's not even talk about it. Let's just forget that ever happened." [...] Taylor later said that Moore's changes made [...] "it work".|$|E

2500|$|Typical of Brewster's portraits is [...] "Francis O. Watts with Bird" [...] (1805), showing [...] "an {{innocent}} looking {{boy with}} manly features" [...] wearing a nightslip {{and holding a}} bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is [...] "strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant," [...] Genocchio has written.

2500|$|An initial {{burst of}} copies were {{probably}} connected with Philip's fund-raising for his rescue of Constantinople. The Bishop of Cambrai from 1439 to 1479 was John of Burgundy, Philip the Good's illegitimate half-brother, and in June 1455 the cathedral chapter commissioned twelve copies from Hayne of Brussels for twenty pounds, of {{which one is}} believed to survive, now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Like the van der Weyden in Houston, this freely interprets the Cambrai original in a contemporary Netherlandish style; the Madonna's faces are of a Northern European type, and their bodies fuller. In both adaptations, the Madonna's gaze has been significantly altered, she now looks directly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and not outwards at the viewer.|$|E

2500|$|Because of his {{previous}} work with maladapted and delinquent children, he {{became interested in the}} development of children and began work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Child</b> Guidance Clinic in London, which was also known as the East London Child Guidance Clinic. [...] Located in Islington, it was founded by the Jewish Health Organisation in 1927 and was the first children's psychiatric facility in the UK and possibly Europe. His interest was probably increased by a variety of wartime events involving separation of young children from familiar people. These included the rescue of Jewish children by the Kindertransport arrangements, the evacuation of children from London to keep them safe from air raids, and the use of group nurseries to allow mothers of young children to contribute to the war effort. Bowlby was interested from the beginning of his career in the problem of separation, the wartime work of Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham on evacuees, and the work of René Spitz with orphans. By the late 1950s, he had accumulated a body of observational and theoretical work to indicate the fundamental importance for human development of attachment from birth.|$|E
