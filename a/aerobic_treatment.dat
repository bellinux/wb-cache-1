40|$|The {{influence}} of high temperature <b>aerobic</b> composting <b>treatment</b> on {{the change of}} heavy metal combined form in pig manure was studied using Tessier sequential extraction method. After <b>aerobic</b> composting <b>treatment,</b> the total concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, As in pig manure increased. The concentrations of residual forms increased generally; only the concentrations of sulfide and organic combined form As and Zn decreased. The concentrations of exchangeable form Cu, Zn, Cr and As decreased markedly. Composting treatment could decrease the distribution coefficients of exchangeable form and carbonate form Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As and Fe-Mn oxides combined form Pb, Cu, Cr and As.

50|$|ATS {{effluent}} {{is relatively}} odorless; a properly operating system will produce effluent that smells musty, {{but not like}} sewage. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> is so effective at reducing odors, {{that it is the}} preferred method for reducing odor from manure produced by farms.|$|E
5000|$|In an <b>aerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> system, {{influent}} first enters an {{aeration tank}} where the powdered carbon is added, {{making up a}} portion of mixed liquor suspended solids.

50|$|In sewage {{treatment}} systems, an anaerobic filter (AF) {{is a form}} of anaerobic digester. The digestion tank contains a filter medium where anaerobic microbial populations—organisms that live in the absence of oxygen — can establish themselves. Such filters are commonly employed in the treatment of waste water. These reactors are gaining in popularity versus more established <b>aerobic</b> waste-water <b>treatment</b> systems because they produce a less solid residue than do other types of filter.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on earlier}} results {{showing that the}} removal of SSRIs from sewage sludge is {{different}} during <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>treatment,</b> {{it was interesting to}} compare this with what would happen in the aeration process that landfill leachate goes through.|$|R
30|$|Biological {{treatment}} systems primarily use aeration {{techniques and}} membrane bioreactors. Aeration techniques produce higher effluent quality compared to filtration techniques. As {{part of this}} system, oxygen is transferred into the gray water through bubbling. This in turn causes the bacteria to multiply and breakdown the organic pollutants. Membrane bioreactors use <b>aerobic</b> biological <b>treatment</b> with filtration techniques for better efficiency and usually disinfected before reusing the treated water. These types of systems however involve higher capital and operational costs.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} septic system, the <b>aerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> system produces {{a high quality}} secondary effluent, which can be sterilized and used for surface irrigation. This allows much greater flexibility in {{the placement of the}} leach field, as well as cutting the required size of the leach field by as much as half.|$|E

50|$|The {{aeration}} {{stage and}} the disinfecting stage are the primary differences from a traditional septic system; in fact, an <b>aerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> system {{can be used as}} a secondary treatment for septic tank effluent. These stages increase the initial cost of the aerobic system, and also the maintenance requirements over the passive septic system. Unlike many other biofilters, <b>aerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> systems require a constant supply of electricity to drive the air pump increasing overall system costs. The disinfectant tablets must be periodically replaced, as well as the electrical components (air compressor) and mechanical components (air diffusers). On the positive side, an aerobic system produces a higher quality effluent than a septic tank, and thus the leach field can be smaller than that of a conventional septic system, and the output can be discharged in areas too environmentally sensitive for septic system output. Some aerobic systems recycle the effluent through a sprinkler system, using it to water the lawn where regulations approve.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{performance}} limitations the water discharged from API type separators usually requires several further processing stages before the treated {{water can be}} discharged or reused. Further water treatment is designed to remove oil droplets smaller than 150 micron, dissolved materials and hydrocarbons, heavier oils or other contaminants not removed by the API. Secondary treatment technologies include dissolved air flotation (DAF), Anaerobic and <b>Aerobic</b> biological <b>treatment,</b> Parallel Plate Separators, Hydrocyclone, Walnut Shell Filters and Media filters.|$|R

40|$|Due to leakages, spills, {{improper}} disposal and accidents during transport, {{organic compounds}} have become subsurface contaminants that threaten important drinking water resources. One strategy to remediate such polluted subsurface environments {{is to make}} use of the degradative capacity of bacteria. It is often sufficient to supply the subsurface with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and <b>aerobic</b> <b>treatments</b> are still dominating. However, anaerobic processes have advantages such as low biomass production and good electron acceptor availability, and they are sometimes the only possible solution. This review will focus on three important groups of environmental organic contaminants: hydrocarbons, chlorinated and nitroaromatic compounds. Whereas hydrocarbons are oxidized and completely mineralized under anaerobic conditions in the presence of electron acceptors such as nitrate, iron, sulfate and carbon dioxide, chlorinated and nitroaromatic compounds are reductively transformed. For the aerobic often persistent polychlorinated compounds, reductive dechlorination leads to harmless products or to compounds that are aerobically degradable. The nitroaromatic compounds are first reductively transformed to the corresponding amines and can subsequently be bound to the humic fraction in an aerobic process. Such new findings and developments give hope that in the near future contaminated aquifers can efficiently be remediated, a prerequisite for a sustainable use of the precious subsurface drinking water resource...|$|R
