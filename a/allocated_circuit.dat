40|$|In a copper-based local loop, {{a circuit}} pair is {{indirectly}} connected to each subscriber usually via a primary cross connection point (PCP) which {{acts as a}} buffer to absorb circuit demand fluctuations among subareas. But some telephone operators adhere to the classic practice of direct wiring based on technological preferences without taking advantage of cost-efficient flexibility points. We analyze the extra cost of maintaining the old practice of direct wiring over the popular one using flexibility points in a single PCP area. For that, the expectation of circuit shortages in subareas during a single replenishment period for the direct wiring is first obtained. Exploiting the convexity of the expectation, we then present a procedure for optimally <b>allocating</b> <b>circuits</b> among subareas, which not only serves its own purpose of circuit provisioning for the direct wiring but also precisely calculates the extra cost over the indirect case...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{system design}} is being {{revolutionized}} by the widespread {{adoption of the}} multi- and many-core paradigms. As the number of elements on a single chip and their performance continue to increase, the communication architecture is gradually becoming the key ingredient determining various trade-offs between costs and performance: on-chip interconnects provide a vital facility for highly parallel systems, particularly in data intensive applications, where {{the choice of the}} underlying communication architecture, tailored on the particular application requirements, is critical to the whole architecture. In that respect, {{the first part of this}} thesis goes through the main options available for building different on-chip communication architectures, focusing on the design automation of structured communication architectures based on crossbars and shared buses connected through bridges. An automated methodology for optimizing many-core interconnect architectures, based on the application communication requirements, is presented. The proposed methodology turns the description of the application communication requirements into an on-chip synthesizable interconnection structure satisfying given area constraints. In addition, it could take into account possible dependencies between tasks in order to co-optimize the communication scheduling and interconnect synthesis. However, it is increasingly challenging for an electrical interconnect to meet power constraints since the power dissipation of electrical on-chip networks poorly scales with performance leading to a growing energy cost. Silicon Photonics seems to be able to empower ultra-high bandwidth with low power consumption: nanophotonic waveguides (the photonic equivalent of a wire) can achieve bandwidths in the Tb/s range, while photonic signaling consumes less power than electrical interconnects since the energy consumption necessary to send a message optically is independent of the bitrate and the distance between the two end-points with no need for power consuming repeaters, regenerators or buffers. However, designing an optical on-chip network requires addressing several challenges that have no equivalent in the electronic domain. The photonics inability to perform inflight buffering and logic suggests the use of hybrid architectures made up of a photonic circuit-switched and an electronic packet-switched networks. In this regard, in the second part of this thesis, we first propose a new power-aware path-setup protocol able to put <b>allocated</b> <b>circuits</b> on a stand-by state, rapidly recovering them when needed. Then, a novel hybrid Optical-Electronic NoC named H 2 ONoC is presented. Thanks to a hybrid optical topology, it is possible to achieve higher bandwidth values and constant energy dissipation regardless of the network and traffic size. Compared to previously proposed architectures, H 2 ONoC exhibits higher throughput, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency with heavy traffic. Therefore the main contribution of the thesis is twofold: engineering as the integration of the proposed design methods into tools to automate the interconnect design steps has direct applicability for designing multi- and many-core systems, and scientific since advanced and original communication architectures exploiting silicon photonics are presented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Numerous {{water supply}} systems and {{community}} based water boards {{have been created}} {{with the aid of}} international organizations and NGOs in developing countries. These water systems have great potential to improve people’s social life and health in these countries. However, in reality, these water systems are often not effectively managed; often, they do not function well and are abandoned before the designed lifespan. Water boards, the community based organizations established to run the systems, could also stop functioning. At the same time, a highly centralized water and sanitation sector, which many of the developing countries have, results in lack of governmental assistance, especially in rural areas. One of the future directions to overcome this situation is decentralization, which gives more authorities to local governments and water boards. Honduras is a typical example of this water management issue, yet with high potential to be a future successful model for the decentralization. Since the 1990 s, the national government has been trying to decentralize its water and sanitation sectors to give more authority to municipalities and local water boards in rural communities. At the same time, both government and community based organizations have been <b>allocating</b> <b>circuit</b> riders to visit the communities to provide technical and administrative assistance. Despite these efforts, there are still problems associated with water management and the decentralization processes. This study attempts to fathom the current issue pertaining to water systems and water boards in Honduras, particularly the impact of decentralization and the need for assistance in rural communities. I interviewed six water boards in three different rural areas to identify the current issues. In addition, related articles and the national laws were reviewed to understand the process of decentralization and the institutional structure of the water and sanitation sector. The study revealed that the rural communities have enough potential to administer their own water systems. However, they have not obtained much benefit or authority from decentralization. None of six communities interviewed is receiving regular support from the government. There are two communities which get regular external assistance and they are having less concern and are confident about maintaining the water systems. On the other hand, communities without any regular external assistance are experiencing difficulties in operating their water systems. In addition, there is less trust among people in these communities to get support from the inside. The study suggests that the national government should still proceed with decentralization but provide more financial and educational support to empower local governments and rural communities. In addition, local governments should facilitate cooperation between communities and resolve conflict between them. However, {{the most important thing is}} for rural communities to improve the situation by joining an organization which provides regular assistance or creating similar organization by themselves...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{circuits}} {{are well}} suited for applications that require predictable service with a constant bit rate for a prescribed period of time, such as cloud computing and e-science applications. Past research on upstream transmission in passive optical networks (PONs) has mainly considered packet-switched traffic and has focused on optimizing packet-level performance metrics, such as reducing mean delay. This study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and packet PON (DyCaPPON) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet-switched service. DyCaPPON provides $(i) $ flexible packet-switched service through dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and $(ii) $ consistent <b>circuit</b> service by <b>allocating</b> each active <b>circuit</b> a fixed-duration upstream transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet traffic. Through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{information}} processing is expressed using quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates which {{are arranged in}} the terms of quantum circuits. Here, each qubit is associated to a quantum circuit wire which is used to conduct the desired operations. Most of the existing quantum <b>circuits</b> <b>allocate</b> a single quantum circuit wire for each qubit and, hence, introduce a significant overhead. In fact, qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation but only between their initialization and measurement. Before and after that, corresponding wires may be used by other qubits. In this work, we propose a solution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum circuits with respect to the required wires. To this end, we introduce a representation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the respective need for wires. Based on this analysis, a method is proposed which "recycles" the available wires and, by this, reduces the size of the resulting circuit. Experimental evaluations based on established reversible and fault-tolerant quantum circuits confirm that the proposed solution reduces the amount of wires by more than 90 % compared to unoptimized quantum circuits.

40|$|One goal of {{synthetic}} biology is {{to design and}} build genetic circuits in living cells {{for a range of}} applications with implications in health, materials, and sensing. Computational design methodologies allow for increased performance and reliability of these circuits. Major challenges that remain include increasing the scalability and robustness of engineered biological systems and streamlining and automating the synthetic biology workflow of “specify-design-build-test. ” I summarize the advances in microfluidic technology, particularly microfluidic large scale integration, {{that can be used to}} address the challenges facing each step of the synthetic biology workflow for genetic circuits. Microfluidic technologies allow precise control over the flow of biological content within microscale devices, and thus may provide more reliable and scalable construction {{of synthetic}} biological systems. However, adoption of microfluidics for synthetic biology has been slow due to the expert knowledge and equipment needed to fabricate and control devices. I present an end-to-end workflow for a computer-aided-design (CAD) tool, Fluigi, for designing microfluidic devices and for integrating biological Boolean genetic circuits with microfluidics. The workflow starts with a ``netlist" input describing the connectivity of microfluidic device to be designed, and proceeds through placement, routing, and design rule checking in a process analogous to electronic computer aided design (CAD). The output is an image of the device for printing as a mask for photolithography or for computer numerical control (CNC) machining. I also introduced a second workflow to <b>allocate</b> biological <b>circuits</b> to microfluidic devices and to generate the valve control scheme to enable biological computation on the device. I used the CAD workflow to generate 15 designs including gradient generators, rotary pumps, and devices for housing biological circuits. I fabricated two designs, a gradient generator with CNC machining and a device for computing a biological XOR function with multilayer soft lithography, and verified their functions with dye. My efforts here show a first end-to-end demonstration of an extensible and foundational microfluidic CAD tool from design concept to fabricated device. This work provides a platform that when completed will automatically synthesize high level functional and performance specifications into fully realized microfluidic hardware, control software, and synthetic biological wetware...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To analyse {{the effect}} of task {{oriented}} circuit training compared with usual physiotherapy in terms of self reported walking competency for patients with stroke discharged from a rehabilitation centre to their own home. Design: Randomised controlled trial with follow-up to 24 weeks. Setting: Multicentre trial in nine outpatient rehabilitation centres in the Netherlands Participants: Patients with stroke {{who were able to}} walk a minimum of 10 m without physical assistance and were discharged from inpatient rehabilitation to an outpatient rehabilitation clinic. Patients were randomly <b>allocated</b> to <b>circuit</b> training or usual physiotherapy, after stratification by rehabilitation centre, with an online randomisation procedure. Intervention: Patients in the intervention group received circuit training in 90 minute sessions twice a week for 12 weeks. The training included eight different workstations in a gym and was intended to improve performance in tasks relating to walking competency. The control group received usual outpatient physiotherapy. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the mobility domain of the stroke impact scale (SIS, version 3. 0). Secondary outcomes were standing balance, self reported abilities, gait speed, walking distance, stair climbing, instrumental activities of daily living, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Differences between groups were analysed according to the intention to treat principle. All outcomes were assessed by blinded observers in a repeated measurement design lasting 24 weeks. Results: 126 patients were included in the circuit training group and 124 in the usual care group (control), with data from 125 and 117, respectively, available for analysis. One patient from the circuit training group and seven from the control group dropped out. Circuit training was a safe intervention, and no serious adverse events were reported. There {{were no significant differences between}} groups for the stroke impact scale mobility domain (β= 0. 05 (SE 0. 68), P= 0. 943) at 12 weeks. Circuit training was associated with significantly higher scores in terms of gait speed (0. 09 m/s (SE 0. 02), P< 0. 001), walking distance (20. 0 m (SE 7. 4), P= 0. 007), and modified stairs test (- 1. 6 s (SE 0. 7), P= 0. 015). There were no significant differences between groups for the other secondary outcomes, except for the leisure domain of the Nottingham extended activities of daily living and the memory and thinking domain of the stroke impact scale. With the exception of gait speed (- 0. 04 m/s (SE 0. 02), P= 0. 040), there were no significant differences between groups at follow-up. Conclusion: Task oriented circuit training can safely replace usual physiotherapy for patients with stroke who are discharged from inpatient rehabilitation to the community and need further training in gait and gait related activities as an outpatient.

40|$|Modern {{consumer}} {{electronic systems}} are mostly based on analog and digital circuits and are designed as analog/mixed-signal systems on chip (AMS-SoCs). {{the integration of}} analog and digital circuits on the same die makes the system cost effective. in AMS-SoCs, analog and mixed-signal portions have not traditionally received much attention due to their complexity. As the fabrication technology advances, the simulation times for AMS-SoC circuits become more complex and take significant amounts of time. the time <b>allocated</b> for the <b>circuit</b> design and optimization creates a need to reduce the simulation time. the time constraints placed on designers are imposed by the ever-shortening time to market and non-recurrent cost of the chip. This dissertation proposes {{the use of a}} novel method, called metamodeling, and intelligent optimization algorithms to reduce the design time. Metamodel-based ultra-fast design flows are proposed and investigated. Metamodel creation is a one time process and relies on fast sampling through accurate parasitic-aware simulations. One of the targets of this dissertation is to minimize the sample size while retaining the accuracy of the model. in order to achieve this goal, different statistical sampling techniques are explored and applied to various AMS-SoC circuits. Also, different metamodel functions are explored for their accuracy and application to AMS-SoCs. Several different optimization algorithms are compared for global optimization accuracy and convergence. Three different AMS circuits, ring oscillator, inductor-capacitor voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO) and phase locked loop (PLL) that are present in many AMS-SoC are used in this study for design flow application. Metamodels created in this dissertation provide accuracy with an error of less than 2 % from the physical layout simulations. After optimal sampling investigation, metamodel functions and optimization algorithms are ranked in terms of speed and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed design flow provides roughly 5, 000 x speedup over conventional design flows. Thus, this dissertation greatly advances the state-of-the-art in mixed-signal design and will assist towards making consumer electronics cheaper and affordable...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} years has the Nostrum Network on Chip (NoC) been {{developed}} to become a competitive platform for network based on-chip communication. The Nostrum NoC provides a versatile communication platform to connect {{a large number of}} intellectual properties (IP) on a single chip. The communication is based on a packet switched network which aims for a small physical footprint while still providing a low communication overhead. To reduce the communication network size, a queue-less network has been the research focus. This network uses de ective hot-potato routing which is implemented to perform routing decisions in a single clock cycle. Using a platform like this results in increased design reusability, validated signal integrity, and well developed test strategies, in contrast to a fully customised designs which can have a more optimal communication structure but has a significantly longer development cycle to verify the new design accordingly. Several factors are considered when designing a communication platform. The goal is to create a platform which provides low communication latency, high throughput, low power consumption, small footprint, and low design, verification, and test overhead. Proximity Congestion Awareness is one technique that serves to reduce the network load. This leads to that the latency is reduced which also increases the network throughput. Another technique is to implement low latency paths called Data Motorways achieved through a clocking method called Globally Pseudochronous Locally Synchronous clocking. Furthermore, virtual circuits can be used to provide guarantees on latency and throughput. Such guarantees are dificult in hot-potato networks since network access has to be ensured. A technique that implements virtual circuits use looped containers that are circulating on a predefined circuit. Several overlapping virtual circuits are possible by <b>allocating</b> the virtual <b>circuits</b> in different Temporally Disjoint Networks. This thesis summarise the impact the presented techniques and methods have on the characteristics on the Nostrum model. It is possible to reduce the network load by a factor of 20 which reduces the communication latency. This is done by distributing load information between the Switches in the network. Data Motorways can reduce the communication latency with up to 50 % in heavily loaded networks. Such latency reduction results in freed buffer space in the Switch registers which allows the traffic rate to be increased with about 30 %. QC 2010112...|$|R
