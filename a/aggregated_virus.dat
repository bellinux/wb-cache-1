In all cases, neutralization {{was due to}} antibody-mediated virus aggregation, and the unpolymerized virions accounted for the residual infectivity. The effect of papain on previously neutralized virus was to deaggregate the virus to fully infective single virions. With some antibodies, the amount of <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> regressed {{in the region of}} greatest antibody excess, even though the virus remained fully neutralized.

40|$|AbstractPrevious studies (Mertenset al., Virology 157, 375 – 386, 1987) {{have shown}} that removal of the outer capsid layer from {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV) significantly reduces (approximately × 10 − 4) the infectivity of the resultant core particle for mammalian cells (BHK 21 cells). In contrast, the studies reported here, using a cell line (KC cells) derived from a species ofCulicoidesthat {{can act as a}} vector for BTV (Culicoides variipennis), demonstrated a much higher infectivity of core particles than that in mammalian cells (approximately × 103). This increase resulted in a specific infectivity for cores that was only 20 -fold less than that of purified disaggregated virus particles (stored in the presence of 0. 1 % sodium-N-lauroylsarcosine (NLS)). Removal of this detergent caused intact virus particle aggregation and (as previously reported) resulted in an approximately 1 log 10 drop in the specific infectivity of those virus particles which remained in suspension. In consequence the specific infectivity of core particles for the KC cells was directly comparable to that of the intact but <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus.</b> These data are compared with the results from oral infectivity studies using two vector species (C. variipennisandCulicoides nubeculosus), which showed similar infection rates at comparable concentrations of purified cores, or of the intact but <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> particles (NLS was toxic to adult flies). The role of the outer core proteins (VP 7) in cell attachment and penetration, as an alternative route of initiation of infection, is discussed. Previous studies (Mertenset al., Virology 157, 375 – 386, 1987) also showed that the outer capsid layer of BTV can be modified by proteases (including trypsin or chymotrypsin), thereby generating infectious subviral particles (ISVP). The specific infectivity of ISVP for mammalian cells (BHK 21 cells) was shown to be similar to that of disaggregated virus particles. In contrast, we report a significantly higher specific infectivity of ISVP but not of the intact virus (approximately × 100) for two insect cell lines (KC cells and C 6 / 36 mosquito cells (derived fromAedes albopictus)). In oral infection studies with adults of the two vector species, ISVP produced the same infection rate at approximately 100 -fold lower concentrations than either core particles or the intact but <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> particles. The importance of mammalian host serum proteases, or insect gut proteases, in modification of the intact virus particle to form ISVP and their role in initiation of infection and the vector status of the insect is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of light}} {{scattering}} {{for the investigation}} of proteins, protein <b>aggregates,</b> <b>viruses</b> and even DNA molecules has become widespread during {{the last couple of}} decades 1. Extensive measurements of the aggregation and gelation of miscellaneous proteins have been done, with globular, easily isolated food proteins getting the most attention.

A few papers have been published that describe the use of light scattering to investigate the most important myofibrillar proteins, myosin and actin. These would usually be the isolated proteins from different animals (for example, rabbit myosin 2). Light scattering is taken to mean in this context both static (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS or PCS). The domain of these techniques is the measurement of molar weight, size, shape (SLS) and diffusion (DLS).

40|$|Aleutian mink disease {{parvovirus}} (ADV) {{causes a}} persistent infection associated with circulating immune complexes, immune complex disease, hypergammaglobulinemia, {{and high levels}} of antiviral antibody. Although antibody can neutralize ADV infectivity in Crandell feline kidney cells in vitro, virus is not cleared in vivo, and capsid-based vaccines have proven uniformly ineffective. Antiviral antibody also enables ADV to infect macrophages, the target cells for persistent infection, by Fc-receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The antibodies involved in these unique aspects of ADV pathogenesis may have specific targets on the ADV capsid. Prominent differences exist between the structure of ADV and other, more-typical parvoviruses, which can be accounted for by short peptide sequences in the flexible loop regions of the capsid proteins. In order to determine whether these short sequences are targets for antibodies involved in ADV pathogenesis, we studied heterologous antibodies against several peptides present in the major capsid protein, VP 2. Of these antibodies, a polyclonal rabbit antibody to peptide VP 2 : 428 - 446 was the most interesting. The anti-VP 2 : 428 - 446 antibody <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> particles into immune complexes, mediated ADE, and neutralized virus infectivity in vitro.

40|$|African horse {{sickness}} virus (AHSV) is an arbovirus {{capable of}} successfully replicating in both its mammalian host and insect vector. Where mammalian cells show a severe cytopathic effect (CPE) following AHSV infection, insect cells display no CPE. These differences in cell death could {{be linked to}} the method of viral release, i. e. lytic or non-lytic, that predominates in a specific cell type. Active release of AHSV, or any related orbivirus, has, however, not yet been documented from insect cells. We applied an integrated microscopy approach to compare the nanomechanical and morphological response of mammalian and insect cells to AHSV infection. Atomic force microscopy revealed plasma membrane destabilization, integrity loss and structural deformation of the entire surface of infected mammalian cells. Infected insect cells, in contrast, showed no morphological differences from mock-infected cells other than an increased incidence of circular cavities present on the cell surface. Transmission electron microscopy imaging identified a novel large vesicle-like compartment within infected insect cells, not present in mammalian cells, containing viral proteins and virus particles. Extracellular clusters of <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> particles were visualized adjacent to infected insect cells with intact plasma membranes. We propose that foreign material is accumulated within these vesicles and that their subsequent fusion with the cell membrane releases entrapped viruses, thereby facilitating a non-lytic virus release mechanism different from the budding previously observed in mammalian cells.

When Pesascek virus was clarified by low-speed centrifugation, homologous antiserum hardly neutralized the virus. However, when the virus was filtered through membranes having a porosity only twice the diameter of the virus, monodispersed virus was obtained which was efficiently neutralized. Serum titers were up to 1, 000 times higher if the neutralization test was carried out with monodispersed virus. Virus in non-neutralizable aggregates was found to constitute 30 % of the infective units of unfiltered Pesascek virus but only 0. 1 % of the antigenically related DuToit strain. This explains why DuToit strain has been a more satisfactory indicator strain for detecting type 4 antibodies, regardless of the echo 4 strain used for inducing the antibodies. Clarified suspensions and ultrafiltrates of viruses belonging to the picorna-, reo-, myxo-, adeno-, herpes-, and poxvirus groups were studied. Clarified suspensions yielded persistent fractions of 0. 005 % for poliovirus, of 0. 1 % for reovirus, of 0. 6 % for influenza virus, of < 0. 001 % for adenovirus, of 0. 06 % for herpesvirus, and of 10 to 30 % for vaccinia virus.

40|$|The {{influenza}} virus enters target cells via {{the action of}} hemagglutinin proteins (HA) inserted into the viral envelope. HA promotes membrane fusion between the viral envelope and endosomal membrane at low pH, following viral binding to sialic acid-containing receptors on target cells, and internalization by endocytosis. The effect of target membrane sialic acid residues on the fusion activity of the {{influenza virus}} towards model membranes was evaluated by both reduction, (i. e. treating somatic cells with neuraminidase- (NA-) prior to virus-cell interactions), and by supplementing liposomes with the gangliosides GD 1 a and GT 1 b. The harshness of the neuraminidase pretreatment of target cells required to affect virus-induced membrane merging was found to greatly depend on the assay conditions, i. e. whether a virus-cell prebinding step at neutral pH was included prior to acidification. Minor concentrations of neuraminidase were found to greatly reduce virus fusion, {{but only in the}} absence of a prebinding step; they had no effect if this step was included. Although membrane merging was greatly reduced following cell neuraminidase pretreatment, virus-cell association at low pH was not disturbed proportionately. This probably reflects unspecific virus-cell binding under these conditions, probably of inactivated or <b>aggregated</b> <b>virus</b> particles, which does not translate into membrane merging. This seems to suggest both that target membrane sialic acid can protect the virus from losing its activity before triggering membrane merging, and that the importance of this interaction is not merely to ensure virus-target proximity.

Wild-type HSV- 1 is resistant to Ab-independent complement neutralization; however, HSV- 1 mutant virus lacking gC is highly susceptible to complement resulting in> 100 -fold reduction in virus titer. We evaluated the mechanisms by which complement inhibits HSV- 1 gC null virus to better understand how gC protects against complement-mediated neutralization. C 8 -depleted serum prepared from an HSV- 1 and- 2 Ab-negative donor neutralized gC null virus comparable to complement-intact serum, indicating that C 8 and terminal lytic activity are not required. In contrast, C 5 -depleted serum from the same donor failed to neutralize gC null virus, supporting a requirement for C 5. EDTA-treated serum did not neutralize gC null virus, indicating that complement activation is required. Factor D-depleted and C 6 -depleted sera neutralized virus, suggesting that the alternative complement pathway and complement components beyond C 5 are not required. Complement did not <b>aggregate</b> <b>virus</b> or block attachment to cells. However, complement inhibited infection before early viral gene expression, indicating that complement affects {{one or more of}} the following steps in virus replication: virus entry, uncoating, DNA transport to the nucleus, or immediate early gene expression.

Experiments were carried out with high and low pH and temperature conditions.

For each experimental condition, Ct values were higher at pH 8 than at pH 6, higher at 5 °C than at 15 °C, and higher for dispersed AD 40 (dAD 40) than for dispersed FCV (dFCV). dFCV and dAD 40 were more sensitive to free chlorine than dispersed PV- 1 (dPV- 1). Cts for 2 log inactivation of aggregated FCV (aFCV) and aggregated PV- 1 (aPV- 1) were 31. 0 and 2. 8 orders of magnitude higher than those calculated from experiments carried out with dispersed virus. Cts for 2 log inactivation of dFCV and dAD 40 in treated groundwater at 15 °C were 1. 2 and 13. 7 times greater than in buffered-demand-free (BDF) water experiments at 5 °C.

40|$|Mesophyll protoplasts {{of barley}} were {{efficiently}} infected with brome mosaic virus (BMV) {{in two different}} ways under different conditions. Polycation-inde-pendent infection occurs at low pH in low ionic strength inoculum whereas poly-cation-dependent i fection occurs at high pH in higher ionic strength inoculum. Optimal conditions at low pH were 20 /~g/ml BMV, 0. 2 #g/ml poly-L-ornithine and 0 " 7 M-mannitol in o-I mM-potassium citrate buffer, pH 5 " 0; about 7 o % of proto-plasts were infected. Optimal conditions at high pH were I/~g/ml BMV, I #g/ml poly-L-ornithine and 0 " 7 M-mannitol in 50 raM-phosphate buffer, pH 8 - 8; nearly 60 % of protoplasts became infected. A brief contact of virus and poly-L-ornithine was essential for infection at high pH whereas it inhibited polycation independent infection at low pH. At high pH, poly-L-ornithine formed <b>aggregates</b> with <b>virus.</b> Infection of protoplasts seemed {{to be controlled by}} the strength of the positive charge on virus particles at low pH and that on the virus-poly-L-ornithine complexes at high pH...|$|R
5000|$|The {{notion that}} viruses were {{particles}} {{was not considered}} unnatural and fitted in nicely with the germ theory. It is assumed that Dr. J. Buist of Edinburgh {{was the first person}} to see virus particles in 1886, when he reported seeing [...] "micrococci" [...] in vaccine lymph, though he had probably observed clumps of vaccinia. In the years that followed, as optical microscopes were improved [...] "inclusion bodies" [...] were seen in many virus-infected cells, but these <b>aggregates</b> of <b>virus</b> particles were still too small to reveal any detailed structure. It was not until the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska (1906-1988) and Max Knoll (1887-1969), that virus particles, especially bacteriophages, were shown to have complex structures. The sizes of viruses determined using this new microscope fitted in well with those estimated by filtration experiments. Viruses were expected to be small, but the range of sizes came as a surprise. Some were only a little smaller than the smallest known bacteria, and the smaller viruses were of similar sizes to complex organic molecules.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to make {{researchers}} aware {{of the benefits of}} an efficient quality control system for prediction of a developed vaccine's efficacy. Two major goals should be addressed when inactivating a virus for vaccine purposes: first, the infectious virus should be inactivated completely in order to be safe, and second, the viral epitopes important for the induction of protective immunity should be conserved after inactivation in order to have an antigen of high quality. Therefore, some problems associated with the virus inactivation process, such as <b>virus</b> <b>aggregate</b> formation, protein crosslinking, protein denaturation and degradation should be addressed before testing an inactivated vaccine in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: This study {{reports the}} {{activity}} of two biguanides against MS 2 bacteriophage used as a surrogate virus for nonenveloped mammalian viruses and provides an explanation as to their apparent limited efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: When tested in a standard suspension test, two polyhexamethylene biguanides (PHMB), VANTOCIL TG and COSMOCIL CQ, reduced the viability of MS 2 by only 1 - 2 log(10) PFU ml(- 1). Exposure time up to 30 min did not affect {{the activity of}} the biguanides, although both PHMB were shown to strongly interact with MS 2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation kinetics and change in virus hydrophobicity suggested that PHMB induces the formation of viral aggregates. This hypothesis was supported using dynamic light scattering that showed an increase in viral aggregates sizes (up to 500 nm) in a concentration-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It has been reported that viral aggregation is responsible for virus survival to the biocide exposure. Here, this might be the case, because the virucidal activity of the biguanides was modest and viral aggregation important. The formation of viral <b>aggregates</b> during <b>virus</b> exposure to PHMB was unlikely to overestimate the virucidal potential of the biguanides...|$|R
40|$|Exames ao microscópio electrônico de tecidos foliares e radiculares de plantas infetadas pelo vírus do mosaico comum ou do mosaico amarelo do feijoeiro, mostraram a presença de dois tipos de inclusões no cito-plasma: filamentosas, consideradas como partículas de vírus, e lamelares, típicas dos vírus do grupo Y. Essas inclusões não foram encontradas no pólen ou no óvulo de feijoeiros infetados. Como o vírus do mosaico comum do feijoeiro é transmitido pelo pólen, sugere-se que êle ocorre nestas células em concentração muito baixa, ou mesmo na forma de ácido nucléico. Two {{types of}} cytoplasmic {{inclusions}} {{were observed in}} leaf and root tissues of host plants infected with the common and yellow bean mosaic viruses: (1) filamentous inclusions considered as an <b>aggregate</b> of <b>virus</b> particles and (2) lamellar inclusions which appeared with varied configurations that represent sections at different angles of the same cylindrical structure. No type of inclusion or virus particle was seen in pollen and ovule from bean plants infected {{with each of the}} two viruses. Since, however, the common bean mosaic virus is transmitted through the pollen it is suggested that it occurs in very low concentration in this structure or else as viral nucleic acid...|$|R
40|$|Electron micrographs of Newcastle virus {{suspended}} in allantoic fluid or water show {{a number of}} irregular globular forms (1). Filamentous or tailed forms have not been found in these fluids. However, when the virus is trans. ferred to saline and a mount is made directly of this material, tailed or spermlike forms are found to predominate (2 - 4). The fdentification of certain particles seen in the electron microscope as virus particles is not easy. Even some 10 years after the original description of the tobacco mosaic virus as a long thin rod (5) there is some discussion as to whether these particles represent individual units (6) or <b>aggregates</b> of <b>virus</b> (7). It is not legitimate to accept any spherical particle obtained from a mixture of materials as virus just {{because it has a}} size which agrees with previous calculations and because it is frequently found in these partially purified preparations. All available methods for associating or dissociating the two must be applied. We first would like to outline certain evidence which we believe associates the filamentous or sperm-like bodies seen in saline preparations with the individua...|$|R
40|$|Ultrastructure {{of plant}} cells doubly {{infected}} with a potyvirus {{and the other}} unrelated viruses was investigated. Five potyviruses and five other viruses were used to make ten combinations of double infections on systemic host plants, and infected leaves were examined by electron microscope. In double infection, the two viruses in every combination were detected in the same cells and were observed at the same sites as those in single infection. Virus-specific inclusions such as <b>virus</b> <b>aggregates</b> or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were consistently observed in doubly infected cells. Particles of cucumber mosaic virus and two tobamoviruses were closely associated with potyvirus-induced inclusion bodies of the tube and scroll types. No {{significant differences were found}} in cytopathological effects and structure of inclusion bodies between single and double infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{proteasome}} {{is a large}} protease complex {{present in}} the cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. This chapter describes how proteasomes in living cells can be visualized using fluorescently tagged subunits. The use of noninvasive fluorescent tags like the green fluorescent protein enables visualization of various subunits of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and prevents possible artefacts like disruption by microinjection or altered fluorescence distribution caused by fixation. Once quantitative incorporation of tagged subunits into proteasomes is ensured, the distribution of proteasome complexes can be visualized in vivo. In addition, different bleaching techniques {{can be applied to}} study the dynamics of proteasomes within the cell. Finally, we describe how proteasomes can be recruited to particular sites of degradation during various cellular conditions like <b>aggregate</b> formation and <b>virus</b> infectio...|$|R
