5|$|Brawl {{allows the}} player to select from 39 characters. Some are new, but others return from Melee—in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, {{fighting}} capabilities, or both. For example, Link and Fox have adopted designs from more recent titles, while Samus has gained the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> {{into a new}} form, Zero Suit Samus. Dr. Mario, Roy, Young Link, Mewtwo, and Pichu are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers or trophies.|$|E
5|$|Brawl also {{features}} compatibility with four kinds of controllers (the Wii Remote on its side, the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination, the Classic Controller, and the GameCube controller), while its predecessors only used the one controller designed for that system.

5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish {{such as the}} flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are {{an important}} component of the C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as list and set, commonly referred to as containers. A common trait among these containers is their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> size during the execution of the program. To achieve this, some form of dynamic memory allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E

30|$|Two other {{relevant}} requirements are evolvability and sustainability. Evolvability {{is related to}} biological systems. According to Rowe and Leaney [145], evolvability is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> self-adapt <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the environment, pre-requirements, or technology changes. Accordingly, this definition has {{a close relationship with}} the autonomic technologies previously discussed.|$|R
5|$|Laing, who {{was charged}} with maleficium, confessed she had made spells with buckets of water and burning coals as well as {{stabbing}} needles into a wax model of her intended victim. She met the Devil {{in the form of}} a black dog on Ceres Moor and made a bargain with him; she knew he was the Devil as he had the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> shape and had undergone a transformation in front of her. Initially she offered him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E
5|$|Tabuu is {{the villain}} of Super Smash Bros. Brawls story mode, The Subspace Emissary. He is a human-shaped {{apparition}} composed of pure energy, {{with a single}} eye-shaped object located where a person's stomach would be. He is able to conjure several weapons for use in battle, including a rapier and large chakram. His other powers include the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his size at will and teleportation. Towards the end of The Subspace Emissary, it is revealed that Tabuu is the entity that controlled Master Hand and the true antagonist behind {{the events of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
50|$|Haruhi Suzumiya (Suzumiya Haruhi) is {{the title}} {{character}} and female protagonist of the Haruhi Suzumiya series created by Nagaru Tanigawa. Despite the series being named after her, the lead protagonist is Kyon. She possesses unconscious god-like <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> destroy, and reshape reality to her desires. In an interview, Tanigawa stated that {{the idea for the}} character came during a sleepless night {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|R

5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of the}} performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E
