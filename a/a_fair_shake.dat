Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shake.</b>|$|E

500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got a raw deal. The actor {{who could have}} been the definitive 007... had the bad luck to inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest, struggling to cope with its general creative decline {{and the end of the}} Cold War". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shake</b> by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E
40|$|As a {{business}} adviser {{one of my}} favourite creative industries rantras – half rant, half mantra – is “make sure you are rewarded for your creative output”. To which I like to add, for reasons of clarity, “don’t write the song but only get paid for t-shirt”. I was reminded of this message again this morning reading an article by Ben Sisario in The New York Times, Defining and Demanding <b>a</b> Musician’s <b>Fair</b> <b>Shake</b> in the Internet Age published 30 Sept 2013. In the article, musician David Lowery expresses his views on an artist’s ability to make money from their music in the teenage years of the 21 st century. Although I am old enough to recognise the name of Lowery’s band, Camper Van Beethoven, I cannot hum, let alone sing, any of its tunes but I think Lowery hits the right notes in his related blog post where he opines: “My Song Got Played On Pandora 1 Million Times and All I Got Was $ 16. 89, Less Than What I Make From a Single T-Shirt Sale!” In the past, what has troubled me about this strange commercial lay-off has been that if businesses and practitioners in the creative industries don’t value their work, then who can blame their customers for not valuing it either. Once you price your creative output (that song or that design) at $ 0 or very close to, then {{that is how the}} larger market will value it too. And who can blame them?  I am constantly disappointed (and exasperated and flummoxed) by the number of creative BUSINESSpeople I have met who are prepared to price their product or service so low that there’s no profit. They justify this approach because they say they need to get some work in the door; OR they will work for free in the hope of so impressing the client they’ll get some paid work someday; OR give it away (via someone else who’ll exploit it) because it will be good marketing; OR offer it up for free in exchange for a new follower or another like.

Reportedly, Lea had become tired of the role and was growing weary of the ambiguous nature of the character.

The night the episode aired, Lea wrote on his personal website: [...] "I felt that [...] wasn't getting <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shake</b> anyway.
