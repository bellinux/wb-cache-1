5|$|After <b>Algeria</b> became {{independent}} in 1962, about 800,000 Pieds-Noirs of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France while about 200,000 chose {{to remain in}} <b>Algeria.</b> Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 {{by the end of}} the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|From the French {{invasion}} on 18 June 1830 {{until its}} independence, <b>Algeria</b> was administratively part of France, and its European population was simply called Algerians or colons (colonists), whereas the Muslim people of <b>Algeria</b> were called Arabs, Muslims or Indigenous.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, <b>Algeria</b> {{signed a}} {{contract}} for 6 AW101 helicopters. In August 2012, {{it was reported that}} <b>Algeria</b> had signed an agreement with AgustaWestland for the provision of up to 80 helicopters, 42 of which were to be AW101s. Under the terms of this arrangement, early aircraft were to be manufactured by AgustaWestland, while <b>Algeria</b> was to commence the assembly of some AW101s later on.|$|E
50|$|By 2013 the American {{historian}} Dr. Niki Gamm {{argued that}} {{the total population of}} Turkish origin remains unclear and that estimates range between 5-10% of <b>Algeria's</b> population of 37 million (accounting to between 1.85 million and 3.7 million) However, by 2015 the Russian government-controlled news agency Sputnik, citing the 2014 Algerian population statistics, reported that there are 760,000 people of full Turkish origin (i.e. 2% of <b>Algeria's</b> population), whilst those of full and partial Turkish origin account to 9.5 million of <b>Algeria's</b> 38 million inhabitants (i.e. 25% of <b>Algeria's</b> population).|$|R

50|$|<b>Algeria’s</b> {{currency}} is the dinar (DZD). The dinar is loosely {{linked to the}} U.S. dollar in a managed float. <b>Algeria’s</b> main export, crude oil, is priced in dollars, while most of <b>Algeria’s</b> imports are priced in euros. Therefore, the government endeavors to manage fluctuations {{in the value of}} the dinar. As of April 2008, US$1 was equivalent to about DZD64.6. <b>Algeria’s</b> foreign currency reserves have grown rapidly since 2000, reflecting rising prices for exported oil. At the end of 2007, foreign reserves totaled US$99.3 billion, up from US$12 billion in 2000 and the equivalent of almost four years of imports. In 2007 the estimated inflation rate was 4.6 percent.|$|R
5|$|P. d. tingitanus (Loche, 1867), {{described}} from <b>Algeria,</b> {{is found}} in the Maghreb from Ajdabiya in Libya to Béni Abbès in <b>Algeria,</b> and to Morocco's Atlantic coast. It hybridises extensively with the Spanish sparrow, especially {{in the eastern part of}} its range.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to <b>Algeria.</b> The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its <b>Algeria</b> policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both <b>Algeria</b> and France.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, <b>Algeria,</b> producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, <b>Algeria</b> were built. <b>Algeria</b> quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
50|$|North American audiences have {{remained}} {{for the most}} part unaware of <b>Algeria's</b> cinematographic experience. Following the nationalization of <b>Algeria's</b> film industry in June 1969, the American Motion Pictures Export Association of America (MPEAA) called for a boycott of all Algerian productions.|$|R

5|$|Those {{who moved}} to France {{suffered}} ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding {{the collapse of the}} French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for <b>Algeria.</b> Thus, the recent history of the Pieds-Noirs has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term rapatriés d'Algérie implies that they once lived in France, most Pieds-Noirs were born in <b>Algeria.</b> Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered Pieds-Noirs, were as indigenous to <b>Algeria</b> as its Muslim population.|$|E

Upon reaching {{the city in}} September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to <b>Algeria.</b> A two-year resistance movement organized {{in response to the}} French capture of the royal palace was effectively put {{down at the end of}} 1897.|$|E

5|$|Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877– 21 October 1904) was a Swiss {{explorer}} and writer. As a teenager, Eberhardt, {{educated in}} Switzerland by her father, published short stories under a male pseudonym. She {{became interested in}} North Africa, and was considered a proficient writer on the subject despite learning about the region only through correspondence. After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to <b>Algeria</b> in May 1897. She dressed as a man and converted to Islam, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in <b>Algeria</b> and the French administration.|$|E
