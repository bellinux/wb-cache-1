She has co-author the Working Paper on Free, Prior and Informed Consent of the Indigenous People which was incorporated in the UN Declaration for Indigenous People. Motoc was on the co-author of the UN Guidelines principles for Extreme poverty. She was the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Human Genome, author of the first reports of the United Nations {{in the field of}} genetics(2004-2007)She was UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for the Democratic Republic of Congo(2001-2004). In this capacity she has visited the Democratic Republic of Congo in conflict area, She has reported on the massive violations on human rights quoted including by International Criminal Court Prosecutor. In 2003 the report of Iulia Motoc has stated [...] "By their magnitude, the violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo cover all the violations contained in the articles of the Rome Statute of the ICC relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes war. These provisions could constitute the legal framework of the violations found in the country, as these violations create a frightening picture of the situation of human rights in the most serious world."Iulia Motoc was elected {{member of the}} Advisory Committee for the Protection on National Minorities (1998-2004) and (2008-2012). She was member of the Fundamental Rights Agency of the European Union(2010-2012)Motoc was <b>arbitrer</b> with ICSID, Washington(2008-2014).|$|E
40|$|This article aims at {{emphasizing}} {{the level of}} institutional ethics {{for the needs of}} an organization, which is the consumersř protection. By the means of this marketing research which has as a starting point the Fishbein- Rosenberg model, we wish to point out the importance of the main attributes specified by the Law of the Public Servant, whether these can be the basis of the relationship between consumers and economic operators. The institution of consumersř protection acts as an <b>arbitrer</b> in this case and we wish to find out whether these attributes follow the requirements of the relationship between consumer and the institution which protects them...|$|E
40|$|The paper reads Bole Butake’s play Family Saga as a {{conscious}} artistic intervention, written {{to mediate the}} conflict between the English-speaking Cameroonians and their French-speaking counterparts. It identifies and analyses the strategies of applied theatre, especially the techniques of forum theatre deployed by Butake to catalyse the process of expiation and amelioration that are a requisite for meaningful reconciliation. The paper further demonstrates how research is simulated within the plot of the play to offer opportunities for recollecting information for reconstructing the myth of origin. It is through the narration of the myth, framed in a play within a play and techniques of forum theatre, that the past is laid bare and interrogated. This forum theatre process that involves a backward glance leads to some kind of expiation, which results in the protagonists ’ discovery of their true identities. The paper argues that Butake uses the possibilities of applied theatre to create dialogue leading to healing of fractured relationships.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a two-component continuous review inventory system {{where one of}} two components is produced by the organisation {{and the other is}} supplied by an outside supplier. The two components are assembled into an end product. There are two different product types. Demand occurs according to a Poisson process for each of the product types. It is assumed that product 1 is produced and its production time is arbitrarily distributed. Production is interrupted when the inventory level of product 1 reaches its maximum level. Replenishment of product 2 is done according to an adjustable reorder policy, and the lead-time follows an exponential distribution. Identifying the stochastic process as a semi-regenerative process, steady-state measures such as mean stationary rate of the number of demands lost, mean number of demands satisfied, mean number of replenishments made, are found. The total unutilised capacity of the production system is found, and a cost analysis is also studied. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the results obtained. OPSOMMING ‘n Voorraadsisteem wat kontinu hersien word vir twee verskillende komponenttipes word bestudeer. Die komponente word gebruik vir twee verskillende produktipes. Die verbruik van elke produktipe word beskryf deur ‘n Poissonverdeling. Die produksietyd vir produktipe 1 is <b>arbitrêr</b> verdeel. Sodra die voorraadpeil van produk 1 die maksimum bereik, word produksie gestaak. Aanvulling van produktipe 2 word gedoen volgens ‘n verstelbare herbestelbeleid met eksponensiele leityd. Identifisering van die stogastiese proses as half-regenererend lei vervolgens tot bepaling van gestadigde maatstawe soos gemiddelde aantal verlore eenhede, gemiddelde bevredigde vraag, en gemiddelde aantal aanvullings. Die totale ledigheid van die sisteem word bepaal en die gepaardgaande koste bereken. ‘n Syfervoorbeeld word voorgehou om die resultate te bevestig...|$|E
