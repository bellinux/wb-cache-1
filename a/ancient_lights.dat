500|$|After the war, Moore {{rejected}} {{a grant to}} study at the University of Cambridge, citing a wish to [...] "stand on my own two feet". He wrote his first book, Guide to the Moon (later retitled Patrick Moore on the Moon) in 1952 and it was published a year later. He wrote it on a 1908 Woodstock typewriter, which he used for every book he published. He was a teacher in Woking and at Holmewood House School in Langton Green, from 1945 to 1953. His second book was a translation {{of a work of}} French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs (Moore spoke fluent French). After his second original science book, Guide to the Planets, he penned his first work of fiction, The Master of the Moon, the first of numerous young adult fiction space adventure books (including the late 1970s series the Scott Saunders Space Adventure); he wrote a more adult novel and a farce titled <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights,</b> though he did not wish either to be published.|$|E

6000|$|The {{child was}} born with good intentions. [...] "Padda be good, be good," [...] {{he used to say}} as the breakables flew before him. [...] "Padda" [...] was his {{rendering}} of Pantagruel, the nickname Redwood imposed on him. And Cossar, disregarding certain <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights</b> that presently led to trouble, did, after a conflict with the local building regulations, get building on a vacant piece of ground adjacent to Redwood's home, a comfortable well-lit playroom, schoolroom, and nursery for their four boys--sixty feet square about this room was, and forty feet high.|$|E
60|$|In the Police Guide of the Fatherland he {{will find}} set forth {{a list of the}} things the doing of which will bring to him {{interest}} and excitement. In Germany you must not hang your bed out of window. He might begin with that. By waving his bed out of window he could get into trouble before he had his breakfast. At home he might hang himself out of window, and nobody would mind much, provided he did not obstruct anybody's <b>ancient</b> <b>lights</b> or break away and injure any passer underneath.|$|E
60|$|McGinnis's Court was a {{democratic}} expression of some obstinate and radical property-holder. Occupying a limited space between two fashionable thoroughfares, {{it refused to}} conform to circumstances, but sturdily paraded its unkempt glories, and frequently asserted itself in ungrammatical language. My window--a rear room on the ground floor--in this way derived blended light and shadow from the court. So low was the window-sill, that had I been the least predisposed to somnambulism, it would have broken out under such favorable auspices, and I should have haunted McGinnis's Court. My speculations as to {{the origin of the}} court were not altogether gratuitous, for by means of this window I once saw the Past, as through a glass darkly. It was a Celtic shadow that early one morning obstructed my <b>ancient</b> <b>lights.</b> It seemed to belong to an individual with a pea-coat, a stubby pipe, and bristling beard. He was gazing intently at the court, resting on a heavy cane, somewhat in the way that heroes dramatically visit the scenes of their boyhood. As there was little of architectural beauty in the court, I {{came to the conclusion that}} it was McGinnis looking after his property. The fact that he carefully kicked a broken bottle out of the road somewhat strengthened me in the opinion. But he presently walked away, and the court knew him no more. He probably collected his rents by proxy--if he collected them at all.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights</b> {{create a}} portal {{through to the}} theatre. Martin reveals that Luke's theory on the <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights</b> is true. Martin insinuates that in the old universe, they used to control all lifeforms. The <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights</b> survived the Big Bang and needed Martin Trueman to rule the world because, he was the 'Chosen One'. Sarah Jane tries {{to talk him out}} of it but to no avail. Rani and Luke try to shut down the {{broadcast}} by flicking the mains switch off, but it is protected by the Ancient Lights' energy. Rani is an Aries and eventually becomes possessed, leaving only people with the star-sign of Taurus, which includes Sarah Jane and Clyde, not under Trueman's control. However Luke, who was not born and so does not have a star-sign, realises he can stop the power of the <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights</b> by breaking Trueman's circle. Realising that he has been beaten, Trueman cannot bear to return to his former life and instead chooses to become one with the stars, disappearing in a trail of golden dust. In the aftermath, the unaware Earth authorities begin a search for Trueman, and Sarah Jane declares the date will be Luke's equivalent to a birthday.|$|E
