5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from Efe's {{that it is}} highly {{unlikely}} that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins can be used to demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E

25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from one another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means {{that one of the most}} interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E
25|$|The poem also captures some {{feelings}} in Coleridge's previous works, especially in analyzing a problematic childhood and {{an exploration of}} religion. Partly, these feelings were fueled by his inability to accept his opium addiction and other problems. The poems also contain Coleridge's desires for Hutchinson, but these were later removed from the printed edition of the works. The editions <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that they reflect the conflict and division that Coleridge felt during 1802. The tone of the poems are different, as the original was passionate and emotional, and the printed version was organized and philosophical.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|The {{sound from}} a Category I whistle is {{primarily}} a byproduct of source motion. In every case, there is a back reaction of the medium on the source (resistive and reactive impedance). One example of a weak back reaction is a vibrating iron body in air. The densities <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> the back reaction is often ignored. Back reactions of air on an air source or water on a water source can be different. In many cases, say turbulent jets, the sound created is random and it is convenient to consider the sound to be merely a byproduct of the flow. In this category the back reaction is insufficient to strongly control source motion, so whistles are not in this category.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff.

And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt.

25|$|Thymidine kinase {{has been}} {{determined}} in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue. No standard method for the extraction or for the assay has been developed and TK determination in extracts from cells and tissues have not been validated in relation to any specific clinical question, see however Romain et al. and Arnér et al. A method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analog 5-Bromovinyl 2'-deoxyuridine. In the studies referred to below the methods used {{and the way the}} results are reported <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that comparisons between different studies are not possible. The TK1 levels in fetal tissues during development are higher than those of the corresponding tissues later. Certain non-malignant diseases also give rise to dramatic elevation of TK values in cells and tissue: in peripheric lymphocytes during monocytosis and in bone marrow during pernicious anemia. As TK1 is present in cells during cell division, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the TK activity in malignant tissue should be higher than in corresponding normal tissue. This is also confirmed in most studies.|$|E

500|$|Professor James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming [...] {{claimed the}} study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess [...] "conscious awareness, {{particularly}} a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours". Rose argues that since fish brains <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from human brains, fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are, so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes. Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex. However, animal behaviorist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because [...] "different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions." ...|$|E
500|$|The Albums 2000–2010 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most reviewers. A writer from The Sun awarded the box set a perfect five star rating, stating [...] "Whether you like hot-pant Kylie, indie Kylie, girl-next-door Kylie or dark Kylie, there's something for every Kylie fan {{in this special}} box-set. Made up of five albums and celebrating ten years of tunes, we challenge you {{to get them out}} of your head." [...] Scott Harrah from Stagezine awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, but did not review the box set; instead, he reviewed each album individually because [...] "all [...] <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> in both sound and concept." [...] Jon O'Brien from AllMusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, labelling her earlier work as [...] "infectious". Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E
500|$|This logical {{structure}} {{can be seen}} as a prototype for the organisation of On the Origin of Species, presenting the detail of various aspects of the problem, then setting out a theory explaining the phenomena, followed by a demonstration of the wider explanatory power of the theory. Unlike the Origin which was hurriedly put together as an abstract of his planned [...] "big book", Coral Reefs is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in the Appendix. Coral Reefs is arguably the first volume of Darwin's huge treatise on his philosophy of nature, like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for the history of life. In presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences, interpreting patterns visible in the present as the results of history. In one passage he presents a particularly Malthusian view of a struggle for survival – [...] "In an old-standing reef, the corals, which <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> in kind on different parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle one with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly favourable circumstances." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{association}} of bisexuality with promiscuity {{stems from a}} variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women, or only with {{one person at a time}} is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural assumptions that [...] "men and women <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other" [...] ("a defining feature of heterosexism"), and that [...] "verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire." ...|$|E

Many no-limit players have difficulty gearing down for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit."

Because one is not (usually) risking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances.|$|E

[...] Non-REM sleep occurs first and after a transitional period is called slow wave sleep or deep sleep. During this phase, body temperature and heart rate fall, and the brain uses less energy. REM sleep (also known as paradoxical sleep), a smaller portion of total sleep time and the main occasion for dreams (or nightmares), is associated with desynchronized and fast brain waves, eye movements, loss of muscle tone, and suspension of homeostasis.|$|E
2500|$|Brightness is {{a measure}} of how much light is {{reflected}} by paper under specified conditions and is usually reported as a percentage of how much light is reflected, so a higher number represents a brighter or whiter paper.

The following table shows how the two systems rate high brightness papers, but there is no simple way to convert between the two systems because the test methods <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>different.</b> Note that the ISO rating is higher and can go above 100. This is because today’s white paper manufacturing uses fluorescent whitening agents (FWA). Because the ISO standard only measures a narrow range of blue light, it is not an adequate measure for the actual whiteness or brightness.|$|E
