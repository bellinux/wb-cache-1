25|$|Neil Livingstone was a Sunday {{school teacher}} and {{teetotaller}} who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He extensively read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises. This rubbed {{off on the}} young David, who became an avid reader, but he <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read Philosophy of a Future State, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale {{that he needed to}} reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.|$|E

500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series back for another season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe reminded us that time has parallels just as space does, and that the past is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its Over There is overlaid on our world." ...|$|E

While Stephen Downie from TV Week quipped, [...] "The romance between Josh and Naomi has a use-by date but, much like the couple, we're willing to enjoy this ride while it lasts." [...] Claire Crick from All About Soap praised the couple, even though she thought they were complete opposites. Crick <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> their [...] "hilarious secret hook-ups".

No matter what the result the motivation was {{for people to understand}} about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people. He <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> God very much and fought with great strength against tyranny and communism. That is what I want the people to understand." ...|$|E

500|$|Like Ken Tucker, Hanson <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> how Olivia {{coped with}} someone posing as herself, {{saying that it}} made her seem like an [...] "honest, real woman". Despite not {{typically}} liking [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes, James Poniewozik of Time Magazine thought it [...] "did quite a good job using the case {{to tell the story}} of the tension between Peter and Olivia, and the emotional aftermath of returning to a life someone else has borrowed". Rhea Dee of Pinkraygun.com almost entirely focused on Olivia's reactions to being back in the prime universe. Dee praised the realistic tone, writing that normally in other shows she was used to the female character being [...] "annoying" [...] after trauma, but [...] "not once in this episode did I feel like Olivia’s emotions were irrational".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{it with a}} B+. SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall wrote, [...] "Tightly written, well acted, {{and directed}} with a sure hand, this second episode of the season bears out my original prediction: this year is going to rock." [...] Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times praised the episode's use of a [...] "Harold", in which three separate plots working off a central theme converge together. He <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> the climatic scene involving a gunshot-induced deaf Peter and the subway. [...] "I hope more people were watching this episode for so many reasons: To see how good [...] "Fringe" [...] has become, to get addicted to the show and, most important, {{to see that they}} quoted my blog in the promo for next week.

[...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E
