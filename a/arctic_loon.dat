40|$|Four viruses {{isolated}} from poultry in the USSR and Poland {{were identified as}} influenza A strains. One strain was closely related to fowl plague virus, the second showed an antigenic relationship to A/chicken/Scotland/ 59 (Hav 5 N 1), and two others were antigenically related to A/duck/Ukraine/ 1 / 63 (Hav 7 Neq 2) and A/duck/England/ 56 (Hav 3 Nav 1). Antibodies to different strains of influenzavirus were detected in sera collected from poultry and from wild birds in the northern area of the USSR. More of the sera collected from migratory sea birds in the autumn gave HI reactions than did those collected in the spring. HI reactions were of higher titre when recent locally isolated viruses were used than with reference strains of influenzavirus. Sera collected {{in the autumn of}} 1969 from wild sea birds (mostly herring gulls, ducks, <b>arctic</b> <b>loons,</b> and long-tailed ducks) frequently showed HI activity not only with avian influenzavirus but also with A/equine/Miami/ 1 / 63 (Heq 2 Neq 2) and A/Hong Kong/ 1 / 68 (H 3 N 2).

5000|$|The black-throated loon, Gavia arctica, was {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus as Colymbus arcticus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae. It {{was moved to}} the genus Gavia by the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1897. The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for [...] "sea mew", as used by the ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific arctica is Latin for [...] "northern" [...] or [...] "Arctic". The name of the subspecies viridigularis stems from the Latin [...] "viridis", meaning [...] "green", and the Latin [...] "gularis", meaning [...] "throated", in reference to the green throat of this subspecies. The common name, black-throated loon, stems from its black throat patch. This loon is also called the <b>Arctic</b> <b>loon</b> and the black-throated diver.|$|E
40|$|The {{advertising}} song {{of birds}} codes both species and individual recognition (Falls 1982). These two functions compete. Individual recognition of mates, kin and com-petitors (Catchpole & Slater 1995) requires variability, but species recognition should select for constancy. Evalu-ation of whether calls, {{like those of}} the common loon, permit individual recognition from year to year requires study over long periods. Such studies might also illumi-nate the trade-off between the constancy required for spe-cies recognition and the variability needed for individual recognition. An increasing number of banded common loons whose vocalizations have been recorded has now made such a study possible. A study of individual recognition in loons is of interest both on theoretical and practical grounds. Some highly endangered birds have loud and conspicuous vocaliza-tions, so a number of investigators have proposed using these vocalizations for individual recognition. By recog-nizing individuals, {{it should be possible to}} estimate population size (McGregor et al. 2000). This approach is attractive because it avoids the necessity of capturing and individually marking individuals. McGregor & Byle (1992) used recordings of European bitterns, Botaurus stel-laris, to recognize individual bitterns. Peake et al. (1998) examined individuality in the vocalizations of the corn crake, Crex crex, and Gilbert et al. (1994) measured the vo-calizations of both European bitterns and <b>Arctic</b> <b>loons,</b> Gavia arctica. In all of these studies, the investigators could recognize individual birds by their vocalizations and found that they were constant within a breeding season and, for a small sample, from one breeding season to the next. However, none of these studies measured the stabil-ity of the vocalizations of marked individuals over several years. We report the results of such a study here. The yodel vocalization of the common loon is a struc-turally complex territorial call (Fig. 1) given in response to an intruding adult on, or flying over, a breeding territory. Loons often yodel at night (McIntyre 1988). Study of yo-dels of marked males (Walcott et al. 1999; Walcott & Evers 2000) has confirmed earlier reports that each male’s yode...|$|R
50|$|Ring-billed, herring {{and great}} black-backed gulls are {{abundant}} {{as well as}} various other waterfowl species. Large numbers of Canada geese and other waterbirds stop at the lake during their fall migration. Mallards have been seen particularly in the Shirleys Bay area. Red-throated <b>loons,</b> <b>Arctic</b> terns, and common terns have also been spotted. Moderate numbers of shorebirds concentrate in the muddier parts of the shoreline such as at Shirleys Bay and Andrew Hayden Park. A colony of purple martins makes their home at the Nepean Sailing Club.|$|R

50|$|The black-throated loon (Gavia arctica), {{also known}} as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>loon</b> and the black-throated diver, is a migratory aquatic bird found in the {{northern}} hemisphere, primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia. It winters along sheltered, ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This loon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It has two subspecies including the nominate. It was previously considered to be the same species as the Pacific loon, of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species, although this is debated. In a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA, the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species, the common loon and the yellow-billed loon.|$|E
40|$|The physico-chemical {{characteristics}} and the planktonic diatom flora were studied in high <b>arctic</b> <b>Loon</b> Lake (Geographical Society Ø, East Greenland). Loon Lake is a cold, monomictic, alkaline, low conductive and likely oligotrophic lake {{with a maximum}} water depth of 11. 70 m and a low diversity of planktonic diatoms. In summer 2003, the lake-water diatom community consisted of three taxa: frustules belonging to the morphologically highly variable Cyclotella ocellata-polymorpharossii-tripartita-complex were most abundant, and both Discostella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria tenera were of minor importance. The morphological variability of the three diatom taxa is documented by light micrographs...|$|E
40|$|Loons {{are large}} diving birds having long, straight, and acutely pointed bills, with {{feathers}} covering the lores (region between eye and bill) and extending to the linear nostrils. There are 10 functional primaries and 22 – 23 secondaries, the inner secondaries {{shorter than the}} primaries. Molting of the remiges (flight feathers) is simultaneous, and the wings are not used for underwater propulsion. The 16 – 20 rectrices (tail feathers) are short and stiff. The body feathers are shiny and water-resistant; aftershafts and adult down feathers are present. The legs are set extremely far back on the body, making standing very difficult and walking or takeoff from land nearly impossible. The tarsus is laterally compressed, with reticulated (network-like) scales, and is unserrated behind. The lobed hallux (hind toe) is long and slightly elevated, the front toes are fully webbed, and all the toes have sharp claws. The wings are long and pointed, and the body is somewhat elongated, with a fairly long neck. The adults have white underparts, and in most species both sexes are spotted or striped with black and white {{on the back and}} neck during the breeding season. All species are monogamous, with distinct breeding and wintering plumages that lack sexual dimorphism. The nests are built of vegetational debris and placed at the water 2 ̆ 7 s edge. The eggs (usually 2) are spotted and are elliptical to ovate, and the young are unpatterned and nidifugous, with two successive coats of uniformly brownish down. The family has a Holarctic distribution, and all the species are migratory, wintering primarily on salt water and breeding solitarily on freshwater lakes or large tundra ponds. Their foods are primarily fish and aquatic invertebrates, but they also eat small amounts of plant materials. Four extant species are usually recognized, all having breeding ranges that include North America, primarily in boreal and arctic regions.

5|$|The {{common loon}} or great {{northern}} diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in <b>Arctic</b> Eurasia. Common <b>loons</b> winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|R
