25|$|While <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> a time {{frequently}} {{marked by}} {{participation in the}} workforce, the number of adolescents in the workforce is much lower now than in years past {{as a result of}} increased accessibility and perceived importance of formal higher education.

AAS use in <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> also correlated with poorer attitudes related to health.|$|E
25|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It {{is a period of}} multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.|$|E

Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and it now appears that premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.|$|E

25|$|A broad way of {{defining}} <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> {{the transition from}} child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan & Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time. However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition—often {{in the form of}} a ceremony—can last for only a few days.|$|E
25|$|According to some accounts, {{phimosis}} prevented Louis XVI of France from impregnating {{his wife}} for the first seven years of their marriage. She was 14 and he was 15 when they married in 1770. However, the presence and nature of his genital anomaly is not considered certain, and some scholars (such as Vincent Cronin and Simone Bertiere) assert that surgical repair would have been mentioned in the records of his medical treatments if it had indeed occurred. It should be mentioned that non-retractile prepuce in <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> normal, common, and usually resolves with increasing maturity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> {{a period}} {{frequently}} marked by increased {{rights and privileges}} for individuals. While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, {{since the advent of}} the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (children here defined as under 18), almost {{every country in the world}} (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked child labor, enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography.|$|E

25|$|One major {{critique}} of youth empowerment {{is that most}} programs take a risk-focused approach. There {{has been a major}} emphasis on what is going wrong for youth in their lives rather than what goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> a time when young people master skills and concepts.|$|E
25|$|Age {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} {{the risk of}} developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. <b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol and other drug experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (see this related article).|$|E
25|$|The end of {{adolescence}} {{and the beginning}} of adulthood varies by country and by function. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered (chronologically and legally) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage. <b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.|$|E

25|$|<b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> also a {{time for}} rapid {{cognitive}} development. Piaget describes adolescence as the stage of life in which the individual's thoughts start taking more of an abstract form and the egocentric thoughts decrease. This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective. A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of executive functions, that is, cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour, which are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex. The thoughts, ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one's future life, playing {{a major role in}} character and personality formation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} {{of social and}} religious transition ceremonies {{that can be found}} in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification. Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which <b>adolescence</b> <b>is,</b> at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge {{drinking is}} more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking {{is associated with a}}dverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.|$|E

25|$|Heavy binge {{drinkers}} {{tend to have}} delayed auditory {{and verbal}} memory and deficits in executive planning function and episodic memory, which are similar to deficits seen in Korsakoff's syndrome. Impairments in spatial working memory and pattern recognition tasks also {{have been found in}} heavy binge drinkers. Impulse control is also impaired in binge drinkers, especially female binge drinkers. Additionally, immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visual information is impaired; conversely, semantic organizational ability is better in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers. Studies in adolescents have shown that regular binge drinking may cause long-lasting cognitive impairments, though the threshold needed to produce significant effects remains unclear. Cognitive impairment in adults is also unclear, as one study found no association between binge drinking and cognitive impairment. Binge drinking is believed to increase impulsivity due to altered functioning of prefrontal–subcortical and orbitofrontal circuits. Binge drinking and alcoholics who have undergone multiple detoxifications is associated with an inability to interpret facial expressions properly; this is believed to be due to kindling of the amygdala with resultant distortion of neurotransmission. Adolescents, females and young adults are most sensitive to the neuropsychological effects of binge drinking. Adolescence, in particular early <b>adolescence,</b> <b>is</b> a developmental stage that is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic and neurocognitive adverse effects of binge drinking due to it being a time of significant brain development.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Adolescence</b> (...) <b>is</b> a {{transitional}} stage {{of physical and}} psychological development that generally occurs {{during the period from}} puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). <b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females. Physical growth (particularly in males), and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties. Thus age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence.|$|E
