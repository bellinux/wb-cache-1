Another study found patients who participated in active therapy shortly after injury increased mobilization of the neck with significantly less pain within four weeks when compared to patients using a cervical collar. Active treatments are light repetitive exercises that work the area to maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or under the care of a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery.

40|$|Background: Different {{mobilization}} protocols {{have been}} proposed for rehabilitation after hand flexor tendon repair to provide tendon excursion sufficient to prevent adhesions. Several cadaver {{studies have shown that}} the position of the neighboring fingers influences tendon excursions of the injured finger. We hypothesized that the positions of adjacent fingers influence the long finger flexor digitorum profundus tendon excursion, measured both absolutely and relative to the surrounding tissue of the tendon. Methods: Long finger flexor digitorum profundus tendon excursions and surrounding tissue movement were measured in zone V in eleven healthy subjects during three different rehabilitation protocols and two experimental models: (1) an <b>active</b> four-finger <b>mobilization</b> protocol, (2) a passive four-finger mobilization protocol, (3) a modified Kleinert mobilization protocol, (4) an experimental modified Kleinert flexion mobilization model, and (5) an experimental modified Kleinert extension mobilization model. Tendon excursions were measured with use of a frame-to-frame analysis of high-resolution ultrasound images. Results: The median absolute long finger flexor digitorum profundus tendon excursions were 23. 4, 17. 8, 10. 0, 13. 9, and 7. 6 mm for the <b>active</b> four-finger <b>mobilization</b> protocol, the passive four-finger mobilization protocol, the modified Kleinert mobilization protocol, the experimental modified Kleinert flexion mobilization model, and the experimental modified Kleinert extensionmobilizationmodel, respectively, and these differences were all significant (p ≤ 0. 041). The corresponding relative flexor digitorum profundus tendon excursions were 11. 2, 8. 5, 7. 2, 10. 4, and 5. 6 mm. Active four-fingermobilization protocol excursions were significantly (p = 0. 013) greater than passive four-finger mobilization protocol excursions but were not significantly greater than experimental modified Kleinert flexion mobilization model excursions (p = 0. 213). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated large and significant differences among the different rehabilitation protocols and experimental models in terms of absolute and relative tendon displacement. More importantly, the present study clearly demonstrated the influence of the position of the adjacent fingers on the flexor tendon displacement of the finger that is mobilized. Clinical Relevance: The positions of adjacent fingers in tendon mobilization protocols have a large influence on both absolute and relative tendon excursions. The most commonly used protocols after flexor tendon repair may not lead to optimal tendon excursions. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} available evidence comparing the effectiveness of different rehabilitation regimes in repaired extensor tendon injuries of the hand. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 -January 2008), PEDro (up to January 2008), EMBASE (1980 -January 2008) and CINAHL (1982 -January 2008) databases was conducted, and reference lists were scanned for relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Studies on the rehabilitation of surgically repaired extensor tendon injuries of the hand in which patients received {{one of the following}} interventions: immobilization, early controlled mobilization, or early <b>active</b> <b>mobilization.</b> DATA EXTRACTION: The methodologic quality of the selected studies was assessed by 2 reviewers. All randomized controlled trials, high quality controlled clinical trials, and other design studies with sufficient quality were included in the best evidence synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four randomized controlled trials and 1 other design study were included. Short-term outcomes after immobilization were significantly inferior to outcomes after early controlled mobilization.

Sixty patients were operated at Padua Orthopaedic Clinic by using the two different procedures: (1) Ma and Griffith in 30 cases and (2) Tenolig in 30 cases. Risk of rupture developing has been evaluated in relation to sex, age, side, kind of trauma, work and presence of preoperative risk factors. The Morbidity of surgical technique has been evaluated in with respect to surgical time, hospital permanence, immobilization, <b>active</b> nonweight-bearing <b>mobilization,</b> assisted weight bearing until the full one, number of early and late complications before and after hospital discharge. Effectiveness has been evaluated in relation to return time to common life, work and sport; anatomical and functional features have been evaluated using McComis score, rating results as: very good (from 80 to 70), good (from 69 to 60), fair (from 59 to 50) and poor (0).

30|$|In {{our first}} series of patients, {{immediately}} after surgery we applied a continuous passive motion machine {{to all of}} the operated ankles. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have been previously published on the immediate postoperative application of a passive motion machine for the postoperative treatment of these lesions, although Ahl et al. [5] have recommended <b>active</b> early <b>mobilization</b> of operated-on ankle fractures, starting the second week after the operation. Moreover, Salter et al. [23] reported in an experimental study that early joint motion stimulates articular cartilage to heal by means of a reparative tissue more similar to hyaline cartilage than to fibrocartilage. We believe that postoperative passive mobilization may enable the patient to achieve quick recovery of the ankle range of motion, as well as better healing of the articular cartilage lesions. In fact, none of the patients in our first series had significant restriction of range of motion of the ankle joint at follow-up, compared with the second series in which we observed moderate limitation of the ankle joint in seven patients. At radiographic examination, we observed minor or moderate signs of osteoarthritis in only two patients of the first series, one of whom had suffered extensive damage to the articular cartilage owing to a severe fracture-dislocation with disruption of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, whereas we observed minor or severe signs of osteoarthritis of the ankle joint in seven patients of the second series.|$|R
40|$|The {{broad-host-range plasmid}} R 1162 is conjugally mobilized at high {{frequency}} by the IncP- 1 plasmid R 751 but is poorly mobilized by pOX 38, a derivative of the F factor. In both cases, {{the origin of}} transfer (oriT) and the Mob proteins of R 1162 are required, indicating that these plasmids are mobilized by similar mechanisms. R 1162 encodes a primase, essential for vegetative replication of the plasmid, that is made both as a separate protein and as the carboxy-terminal domain of MobA, one of the R 1162 mobilization proteins (P.

When R 751 is the mobilizing vector, the primase is not required for mobilization of plasmids containing cloned mob-oriT R 1162 DNA. However, detectable mobilization of such plasmids by pOX 38 requires both the primase and its cognate initiation site, oriented for synthesis of the complement to the transferred strand. The long form of the primase is required for optimal transfer: R 1162 replicons lacking this form also are not transferred detectably by pOX 38 and are less well mobilized by R 751. The distance between oriT and the primase initiation site affects the frequency of mobilization, and this effect is polar {{in the direction of}} transfer. Our results indicate that the R 1162 primase is <b>active</b> in <b>mobilization</b> of R 1162 and suggest that the MobA-linked form is an adaptation increasing its effectiveness during transfer...|$|R
