The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of different dairy-based food products on early atherogenesis using both conventional and metabonomic approaches in hyperlipidemic hamsters. The hamsters received up to 200 g/kg of fat as <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butter</b> or cheese made from various milk fats or canola-based oil (CV), in addition to a non-atherogenic low-fat diet. Aortic cholesteryl ester loading was considered to be an early atherogenic point, and metabolic changes linked to atherogenesis were measured using plasma (1) H NMR-based metabonomics. The lowest atherogenicity was obtained with the plant-oil cheese diet, followed by the dairy fat cheese diet, while the greatest atherogenicity was observed with the butter diet (P< 0. 05). Disease outcome was correlated with conventional plasma biomarkers (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, R(2) = 0. 42 - 0. 60). NMR plasma metabonomics selectively captured part of the diet-induced metabotypes correlated with aortic cholesteryl esters (R(2) = 0. 63). In these metabotypes, VLDL lipids, cholesterol, and N-acetylglycoproteins (R(2) range: 0. 45 - 0. 51) were the most positively correlated metabolites, whereas a multimetabolite response at 3. 75 ppm, albumin lysyl residues, and trimethylamine-N-oxide were the most negatively correlated metabolites (R(2) range: 0. 43 - 0. 63) of the aortic cholesteryl esters. Collectively, these metabolites predicted 89 % of atherogenic variability compared to the 60 % predicted by total plasma cholesterol alone. In conclusion, we show that the food environment can modulate the atherogenic effect of dairy fat. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the first use of plasma metabonomics for improving the prognosis of diet-induced atherogenesis, revealing novel potential disease biomarkers...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} alcohol extracts of chamomile flowers (CFE), anise seeds (ASE) and dill seeds (DSE) in corn oil, soybean oil, beef tallow and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butter</b> fat (ABF) was investigated during storage at 65 &# 194;&# 186;C. The extent of oxidation {{was followed by}} peroxide value (PV). In addition, reducing power of these extracts was determined. Alcohol extracts of these plants at 3 g kg - 1 were more effective as antioxidant than BHA (0. 2 g kg - 1) in corn and soybean oils, while they were less effective in beef tallow and ABF. CFE was more effective in retarding fat oxidation in corn and soybean oil than ASE and DSE, which both showed similar activity. However, in beef tallow and ABF all extracts showed similar activities. On the other hand, the reducing power of these extracts showed different behavior. CFE, which was the most active as antioxidant among the extracts showed the lowest reducing power. Furthermore, ASE and DSE, which exhibited similar antioxidant activity, the former has lower reducing activity than the latter, indicating that the antioxidant activity didn&# 226;&# 128;&# 153;t correlate linearly with the reducing power of these extracts. Se investig&# 243; la actividad antioxidante de extractos alcoh&# 243;licos de flores de camomila (CFE), semillas de an&# 237;s (ASD) y eneldo (DSE) en aceites de ma&# 237;z y soja, sebo y grasa de mantequilla anhidra (ABF), almacenados a 65 &# 194;&# 186;C. El seguimiento de la oxidaci&# 243;n se realiz&# 243; mediante el &# 237;ndice de per&# 243;xidos. Adem&# 225;s, se determin&# 243; el poder reductor de los mismos. La actividad antioxidante de los extractos alcoh&# 243;licos de estas plantas (3 g k - 1) result&# 243; m&# 225;s eficaz que la del BHA (0. 2 g kg - 1), en cambio, resultaron menos eficaces en el sebo y ABF. El extracto de manzanilla result&# 243; ser mejor antioxidante para los aceites de ma&# 237;z y soja que los extractos ASE y DSE, ambos mostraron una actividad similar. Sin embargo, en el sebo y la ABF todos los extractos revelaron una actividad antioxidante parecida. El poder reductor de estos extractos mostr&# 243; un comportamiento diferente. El CFE que fue el extracto m&# 225;s activo como antioxidante present&# 243; el menor poder reductor, adem&# 225;s, mientras que los extractos ASE y DSE presentaron una actividad antioxidante similar, el primero de ellos mostr&# 243; un poder reductor inferior, indicando que la actividad antioxidante no se correlaciona linealmente con el poder reductor de estos extractos...|$|E
