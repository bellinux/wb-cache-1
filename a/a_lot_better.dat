25|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself for New South Wales thereafter, Jaques transformed his career by signing for the English County Championship side Northamptonshire in 2003. He was prolific, hitting over 1200 runs including a triple century {{and returned to}} NSW an established member of the Pura Cup Champions. 2003/04 saw the consolidation of Jaques' English form in Australia as he built a reputation of being a player who could score quickly but also occupy the crease for many hours. After returning to England to play for Yorkshire (1,118 runs in 2004 and 1,359 in 2005) and maintaining a consistent standard with New South Wales (1,191 runs in 2004–05), many were calling for his promotion to the national team. He went back to England to play for Worcestershire for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, where he scored 1689 runs in 18 matches. Uniquely for the current Australian test team, Jaques has played more first-class games overseas than he has in Australia (62 overseas, mainly in England, 51 in Australia as of 25 November 2007).

The song's refrain of [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> when you're gone" [...] betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Mark Deming {{has pointed out that}} {{the use of the word}} [...] "probably" [...] in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, The Byrds' manager, has noted that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, [...] "There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll Feel <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> <b>Better,</b> it doesn't say: [...] "I'll feel <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better", but [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better."
