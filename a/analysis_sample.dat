OA is performed during routine predictive maintenance to provide meaningful and accurate information on lubricant and machine condition.

The study of wear in machinery is called tribology. Tribologists often perform or interpret oil analysis data.|$|E

50|$|Estimate the Discriminant Function Coefficients and {{determine}} the statistical significance and validity—Choose the appropriate discriminant analysis method. The direct method involves estimating the discriminant function {{so that all the}} predictors are assessed simultaneously. The stepwise method enters the predictors sequentially. The two-group method should be used when the dependent variable has two categories or states. The multiple discriminant method is used when the dependent variable has three or more categorical states. Use Wilks’s Lambda to test for significance in SPSS or F stat in SAS. The most common method used to test validity is to split the sample into an estimation or <b>analysis</b> <b>sample,</b> and a validation or holdout sample. The estimation sample is used in constructing the discriminant function. The validation sample is used to construct a classification matrix which contains the number of correctly classified and incorrectly classified cases. The percentage of correctly classified cases is called the hit ratio.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{complexity}} of the mechanisms regulating heart rate, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that applying HRV analysis based on methods of non-linear dynamics will yield valuable information. Although chaotic behavior has been assumed, more rigorous testing has shown that heart rate variability cannot be described as a low dimensional chaotic process. However, application of chaotic globals to HRV has been shown to predict diabetes status. The most commonly used non-linear method of analysing heart rate variability is the Poincaré plot. Each data point represents a pair of successive beats, the x-axis is the current RR interval, while the y-axis is the previous RR interval. HRV is quantified by fitting mathematically defined geometric shapes to the data. Other methods used are the correlation dimension, nonlinear predictability, pointwise correlation dimension, detrended fluctuation analysis,approximate entropy, sample entropy, multiscale entropy <b>analysis,</b> <b>sample</b> asymmetry and memory length (based on inverse statistical analysis). It is also possible to represent long range correlations geometrically.|$|E
5000|$|The Couette flow {{orientation}} {{system is}} {{the most widely used}} method of sample orientation for UV LD. It has a number of characteristics which make it highly suitable as a method of sample alignment. Couette flow is currently the only established means of orientating molecules in the solution phase. This method also requires only very small amounts of <b>analysis</b> <b>sample</b> ( [...] 20 - 40 µl) in order to generate an LD spectrum. The constant recirculation of sample is another useful property of the system, allowing many repeat measurements to be taken of each sample, decreasing the effect of noise on the final recorded spectrum. [...] Its mode of operation is very simple, with the sample sandwiched between a spinning tube and a stationary rod. As the sample is spun inside the cell, the light beam is shone through the sample, the parallel absorbance calculated from horizontally polarised light, the perpendicular absorbance from the vertically polarised light. Couette flow UV LD is currently the only commercially available means of LD orientation.|$|E
