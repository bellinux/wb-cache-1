5000|$|Like TVB, ATV used a {{contract}} artist system, {{in which the}} station acted as both employer and booking agent. Artistes were signed to contracts which mean that they could only appear in that station's programmes; the artistes were kept on a basic wage with <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> <b>paid</b> on a per episode or per appearance basis. Acting as an artiste's booking agent, the station would also have a veto in what personal appearances, endorsements and advertisements an artiste may take, demanding a cut of all fees. Artistes would also be pushed to take jobs favored by the station, with artistes who rebelled and refused being put [...] "on ice" [...] (Chinese: 被雪, 雪藏), or being forced to see out their contract at the basic wage, but not being used in any of station's programs and forbidden from any other work.

25|$|Prior to 1960, law {{enforcement}} in Suffolk County was the responsibility of local towns and villages {{as well as the}} New York State Police. From the 17th century until well into the 20th century, many of these jurisdictions employed only part-time constables, who were usually appointed by local communities and paid to enforce court orders. <b>Additional</b> <b>fees</b> were <b>paid</b> for making arrests, serving warrants and transporting prisoners.

25|$|Sisal: In 1928, the Societe Fonciere du Sud de Madagascar began {{testing the}} {{viability}} of growing Sisal near Ranopiso. While about 1,000 hectares were planted, by 1935 exports were only 65 tons. In 1932, this company obtained a 4,000 hectare concession in the Mandrare river valley where sisal was found to flourish. By 1947, five sisal companies had a total of 3,075 hectares planted and employed 1,470 people. In 1951, a station of the applied research institute IRCT - Centre de Recherches Sisalières du Mandrare - is set up {{in order to enhance}} sisal intensive farming and productivity. Production grew from 2,500 tons in 1950 to almost 29,000 tons produced in 1964. By 1959, due to the steel bridge erection easing the Mandrare right bank development, six companies had expanded the area, cultivated to 14,528 hectares and employed 4,502 people. Between 1953 and 1958, in part due to <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> <b>paid</b> by France, these exports were worth 500 millions CFA. In 1962, there were 7,500 people (men and women) producing sisal and the value of sisal exports was just over 1 billion FMG (a year when 99 ships docked in Fort Dauphin) and while it was just over two billion FMG in 1964, by 1966 the value of exports was just under one billion FMG and the number of employees had dropped to 4,500 by 1967. By 1969, there were about 20,000 hectares planted producing about 25,000 tons per year (half of which went to France) which was the limit established for Madagascar by the FAO. However, in three years in the mid-1960s, the value of sisal decreased by more than 50 percent due to synthetic fibers which took sisal's place. In spite of this, production was almost 25,000 tons as late as 1970. Current production is appx. 3,000 tons per year from the Mandrare Valley.|$|R

Abstract Research on the design of assistive educational technologies rarely explicitly address the implications of children's sociodemographic characteristics, such as class, race and gender. Through a field-study with children with visual impairments, we investigated how their experiences of the classroom and of disability varied depending on their socioeconomic contexts. Children whose families were of lower socioeconomic status {{were more likely to report}} feeling excluded, and to refer to school as a "hardship" with "little purpose. " We reflect here on the extent to which design interventions can contribute to (re) shape these experiences, and on the position of the researcher as an ally...|$|R

40|$|Many of our Latino {{immigrant}} students belong to indigenous cultures within Mexico. Their families often maintain the unique cultural heritages that existed {{long before the}} arrival of the Spaniards. This class is the first in a sequence of three that studies ancient civilizations of Mexico and traces their influence on Mexican society throughout history and into the present. This series begins with the early cultures of Mesoamerica and ends with the Olmecs and the Mayans. Students will read about one aspect of the specific topic of each class and then make a brief presentation of what they learned. In a friendly, supportive environment, students will expand their facility with the Spanish language while learning about the varied and interesting cultures of the people who speak it.
