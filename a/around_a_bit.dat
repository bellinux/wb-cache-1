25|$|Reviews for the Wii {{version of}} the game have been mixed. Most people criticized the game's {{questions}} for being too simple and repetitive, some which are not based on Pixar movies (though the questions do change <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with quick, shallow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides; the bird rarely if ever soars. When it lands, it will jerk the tail forcefully {{just like a}} wagtail. A laughing falcon frequently and often conspicuously stays on a perch for hours, sitting upright and observing the ground alertly, sometimes flicking its tail or nodding, or moving <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> on its perch with slow, cautious little steps. It is generally peaceful and unlike other falcons will not harm smaller birds.|$|E

500|$|Calleia excelled as {{the villain}} in films, {{but he wanted}} to create {{characters}} with some sympathy. [...] "I'd like to get away from straight villain roles," [...] he said in a 1936 interview. [...] "But I have no wish to be a hero. I enjoy roles where I get slapped <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> It's far more stimulating to play a character that isn't all one thing—not all bad and not all good." [...] He created a series of darkly mysterious characters edged with humor in films including Algiers (1938), Five Came Back (1939), Golden Boy (1939), The Glass Key (1942) and Gilda (1946).|$|E

Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at this point, I want to switch things <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E

[...] Kellman selected [...] "Amor Gitano", [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] and the [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] remix as the highlights of the EP. The EP led to Beyoncé receiving a nomination for Pop New Artist of the Year at the 2008 Lo Nuestro Awards, and [...] "Bello Embustero" [...] was nominated for Record of the Year at the 8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Kenneth E. Rathburn of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "Both {{versions}} of 'God Help the Outcasts' offer {{a level of}} mid-road quality {{that came to be}} expected after the Disney Renaissance," [...] writing of Mollenhauer's, [...] "The film version seems to limp <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> while delivering more of that emotional punch needed as we transition to the second act," [...] while Midler's [...] "has that credits vibe we all know and love from Disney films" [...] which [...] "keeps us sticking around when we'd otherwise abandon the theater." [...] However, Rathburn concluded, [...] "said version is a little detached for the sake of thematic relevance." [...] Jack Smith of BBC Online gave the song a very unfavorable review, writing, [...] "The sentiments of 'God Help The Outcasts' ... are spoiled by syrupy production," [...] describing Midler's rendition as [...] "overwrought." [...] Plugged In observed, [...] "One heartwarming scene finds Esmeralda praying selflessly on behalf of the world's outcasts." [...] However, [...] "such moments are overshadowed by simmering passions, a shapely heroine and dark elements likely to upset." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tricky is {{a father}} to two daughters. The {{musician}} Martina Topley-Bird, who was discovered by Tricky while {{she was sitting on}} a wall near his Bristol home, is the mother of one of the daughters Mazy.

2500|$|Polanski {{approached}} the subject skeptically, saying, [...] "I don't {{believe in the}} occult. I don't believe. Period." [...] Yet he enjoyed the genre. [...] "There [...] {{a great number of}} clichés of this type in The Ninth Gate, which I tried to turn <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> You can make them appear serious on the surface, but you cannot help but laugh at them." [...] The appeal of the film was that it featured [...] "a mystery in which a book is the leading character" [...] and its engravings [...] "are also essential clues".|$|E
2500|$|It {{appears that}} {{what is now the}} DDMFZ was {{originally}} aligned on the OWL. [...] Then about 50 Ma ago North America crashed into what is now the Olympic Peninsula along an axis nearly perpendicular to the OWL, pushing the rock of the Mesozoic (pre-Cenozoic) Western and Eastern Melange Belts (WEMB, blue on the map) across the OWL, bowing the DDMFZ, and initiating the SCF and thereby splitting the Chuckanut Formation. [...] On {{the north side of the}} DDMFZ, and wrapping <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> to the east side, is a suite of distinctive rocks – the Helena—Haystack mélange ("HH Melange" [...] on the map) – which was collapsed into vertical folds. [...] Similarly distinctive rock is found in Manastash Ridge (shown on the map, but almost too small to see) still lying on the OWL, just east of the SCF.|$|E

2500|$|A Spring 1981 {{concert at}} the Palladium in New York City {{proved to be a}} turning point. Described by music journalists as a career-defining {{performance}} by Jett, it helped solidify a strong New York following for Joan Jett & the Blackhearts. After a year of touring and recording, the Blackhearts recorded a new album entitled I Love Rock 'n Roll for the label. Ambel was replaced by local guitarist Ricky Byrd during the recording. Byrd recalled in an interview with Guitarhoo!, [...] "One day I went to a studio to jam <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with Jett and everything clicked". The first single from the album was a cover of the title track, [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll", originally written and recorded by Arrows, which {{in the first half of}} 1982 was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks in a row. It is Billboards No. 56 song of all time and has also been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Sneaky Sound System {{established}} their own label, Whack Records. Angus recalled being rejected by recording companies when proposing {{an album of}} original material, [...] "We were told by every label we might sell 10,000 copies and it wasn't worth it ... {{so we decided to}} do it ourselves". On 15 November that year, they issued their debut single, [...] "Hip Hip Hooray", on their label and distributed by MGM Distribution. Angus wrote the track, and contributed guitar, keyboards, bass guitar, drums and lead vocals. It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top100. In late May, Hesse indicated that a new album was due later that year. However, he left soon after and the group decided that they required a female vocalist, Angus and D met Connie Mitchell (ex-Primary) by chance in a public park as she sat singing and playing guitar to a friend. They asked her to join as lead vocalist, Mitchell later remembered, [...] "I thought they were a bit dodgy ... You know, two guys coming up to you, excited, jumping <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> saying 'Come to our studio'". Their second single, [...] "Tease Me", had been recorded before Mitchell joined with lead vocals by D and guest vocalist Pepper (Pip Edwards), it appeared on 18 July 2005, but did not chart.|$|E

She also said that she tries to concentrate on the [...] "happy times".|$|R
5000|$|Lennon has {{described}} the material as [...] "a bit more free-flowing than his previous work", calling it his [...] "favourite album so far". Revealing how Everything Changes came about, Lennon explained: [...] "Obviously, if {{you sit down and}} play <b>around</b> for <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> you’re {{going to come up with}} ideas. One thing led to another and pretty soon I had about 30 ideas, so I invited some friends to come over and flesh them out into songs".|$|R

We took more time on that song, and took it to the studio, and saw the whole thing really come to life, from scratch.|$|R
