Dylan's mother approaches him, {{and tells him}} {{that he is not}} like other kids <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Doggett arrives at the girl's home and finds Reyes and Natalie alive. Dylan and his mother, however, are nowhere to be found. A subsequent search of the Lokensgard home reveals other bodies, including the bug specialist, cocooned but survived, and Dylan's father, who supposedly ran off years earlier. After leaving with his mother, Dylan sends Natalie one last message in the form of fireflies: [...] "I love you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There was {{one moment}} in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers – under Gur's command – reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody {{prepared}} it and nobody was prepared for it; {{it was as if}} Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of [...] "Hatikvah"".|$|E
500|$|Hill, on {{the other}} hand, argued that: [...] "The United Kingdom was not a foreign power at Federation, is not a foreign power now <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a foreign power while the Constitution remains in its present form." [...] Hill said that because the Constitution was enacted {{as part of a}} statute of the British Imperial Parliament it derived its {{validity}} from British law. Further, she argued that because section 128 of the Australian Constitution provides that the Constitution cannot be changed except in accordance with that section, then only a constitutional referendum could change this special status of the United Kingdom, and the Australia Act had no effect, [...] "so long as the United Kingdom retained any residual influence upon legislative, executive or judicial processes in Australia, it could not be regarded as 'foreign' to Australia." ...|$|E

500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of}} the playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in life, Lady Munster {{became a}} novelist and short story writer, writing {{under the title}} the Countess of Munster. At the age of nearly sixty, she {{published}} two novels; her first, Dorinda, in 1889, and her second, A Scotch Earl, in 1891. The plot of Dorinda centred on {{a young woman who}} eventually kills herself after stealing works of art from her friends. Oscar Wilde noted Munster's skill in writing Dorinda; he compared the [...] "exceedingly clever" [...] novel's eponymous heroine to [...] "a sort of well-born" [...] Becky Sharp, and praised the author's ability [...] "to draw... in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social types and social exceptions". In 1888, an article by Munster about ballad singing appeared in The Woman's World, a Victorian women's magazine edited by Wilde. A Scotch Earl, which centred on a vulgar Scottish nobleman named Lord Invergordon, was less well received by contemporaries. The Spectator published a critical review soon after its publication which suggested that the novel's showering of [...] "contempt upon the society of wealth and rank" [...] was close to Republicanism or Socialism. The review criticised A Scotch Earl for lacking [...] "any merits of construction or style", and added that Lady Munster was [...] "not <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a capable novelist".|$|E

2500|$|... "The EU is not <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a superpower" [...] {{because the}} EU lacks [...] "the {{substance}} of superpowers" [...] due to shortcomings in the EU foreign & military policy according to David Miliband, the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, who explained the requirements: [...] "reach [...] possess {{the capacity to}} arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government's will". Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd opined: [...] "In geopolitical terms Europe is now irrelevant".|$|E

2500|$|The {{criticism}} of writing in Plato's Seventh Letter, whose authenticity is contested, is nonetheless {{accepted by the}} Tübingen School. There Plato asserts—if he is really the author—that his teaching can only be communicated orally (at least, he says, {{that part of it}} he is 'serious' about). He emphatically says that there is no text capable of expressing his philosophy <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> since it cannot be communicated like other teachings. [...] Real understanding in the soul, the letter continues, arises only from intense, common effort and a shared path in life. Deep insights occur suddenly, the way a spark flies up and lights a fire. Fixing thought in writing is damaging since it produces illusions in the minds of readers, who either despise what they do not understand or become arrogant about their superficial learning.|$|E
2500|$|Following its {{re-election}} with {{a majority}} government in the 1998 Quebec provincial election, the Parti Québécois government of Lucien Bouchard announced plans to amalgamate the twenty-nine municipalities on Montreal Island. The province's initial plan was to create three new cities (representing the eastern, central, and western zones of the island), but this was later superseded by a plan to amalgamate the entire island into a single municipality. Bossé and other suburban mayors vocally opposed these plans, with Bossé on one occasion saying that mergers [...] "were not, are not, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the solution to the}} problems of the metropolitan region." [...] Bossé later briefly offered support in principle for a plan, proposed by provincial advisor Louis Bernard, to create one city divided into twenty-seven boroughs. This notwithstanding, he ultimately opposed the government's final strategy for amalgamation (which included the creation of boroughs) and led a public protest against the merger in December 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Newly {{arrived in}} Rome, Ingres read with {{mounting}} indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings {{sent to him}} from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: [...] "So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace;... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; [...] and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine." [...] He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, [...] "When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry." ...|$|E

A Baraita taught that there never was an apostate town <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Rabbi Eliezer said that no city containing even a single mezuzah could be condemned as an apostate town, as [...] instructs with regard to such a town, [...] "you shall gather all the spoil of it {{in the midst of the}} street thereof and shall burn [...] [...] [...] all the spoil," [...] but if the spoil contains even a single mezuzah, this burning would be forbidden by the injunction of [...] which states, [...] "you shall destroy the names of [...] [...] [...] [...] You shall not do so to the Lord your God," [...] and thus forbids destroying the Name of God.
