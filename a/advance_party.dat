5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s <b>advance</b> <b>party,</b> formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed.

The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E

Washington, who was with the general, surmised that the evil he had apprehended had come to pass. For want of scouting <b>parties</b> ahead the <b>advance</b> <b>parties</b> were suddenly and warmly attacked. Braddock ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Burton to hasten to their assistance with {{the vanguard of the}} main body, eight hundred strong. The residue, four hundred, were halted, and posted to protect the artillery and baggage.|$|R

The leading element of Sullivan's column, General Thomas Conway's brigade, attacked the British 2d Light Infantry battalion, which had been reinforced by the British 40th Regiment of Foot under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Musgrave.
