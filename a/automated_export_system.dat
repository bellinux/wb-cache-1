Most exporters now file the required documents via the <b>Automated</b> <b>Export</b> <b>System.</b> Because of filing options, {{for the majority}} of exporters, we have no information on &quot;low-valued &quot; exports (LVEs), those valued at or below the exemption level of $ 2, 500; for the remainder, we have records for all LVEs. As exporters are not required to report their LVEs, the Census Bureau estimates the low-valued component for any country by multiplying its total of exports valued over $ 2, 500 by a pre-determined factor. This factor, specific to the country of export, was determined in the late 1980 's based on data collected up to that point in time. However, while export patterns [...] commodities, modes of transport, quantities, and values [...] have changed, the factors remain the same. Some experts believe that the current system may underestimate LVEs. In this paper, we look back at research into several approaches to estimate LVEs.

40|$|Corynebacterium glutamicum {{is known}} for its {{effective}} excretion of amino acids under particular metabolic conditions. Concomitant activities of uptake and excretion systems would create an energy-wasting futile cycle; amino acid <b>export</b> <b>systems</b> are therefore tightly regulated. We have used a DNA microarray approach to identify genes for membrane proteins which are overexpressed under conditions of elevated cytoplasmic concentrations of methionine. One of these genes was brnF, coding for the larger subunit of BrnFE, a previously identified two-component isoleucine <b>export</b> <b>system.</b> By deletion, complementation, and overexpression of the brnFE genes in a C. glutamicum strain, in which the two uptake systems for methionine were inactivated, we identified BrnFE as being responsible for methionine export. In the presence of both substrates in the cytoplasm, BrnFE was found to transport isoleucine and methionine at similar rates. The expression of the brnFE gene cluster depends on an Lrp-type transcription factor and was shown to be strongly induced by increasing cytoplasmic methionine concentration. Methionine was a better inducer than isoleucine, indicating that methionine rather than isoleucine might be the native substrate of BrnFE. When the synthesis of BrnFE was blocked by chloramphenicol, fast methionine export was still observed, but only at greatly increased cytoplasmic levels of this amino acid. This indicates the presence of at least one other methionine <b>export</b> <b>system,</b> presumably with low affinity but high capacity. Under conditions where cytoplasmic methionine does not exceed a concentration of 50 mM, BrnFE is the dominant <b>export</b> <b>system</b> for this amino acid...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cell simulation, {{which aims}} to predict the complex and dynamic {{behavior}} of living cells, is becoming a valuable tool. In silico models of human red blood cell (RBC) metabolism have been developed by several laboratories. An RBC model using the E-Cell simulation system has been developed. This prototype model consists of three major metabolic pathways, namely, the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the nucleotide metabolic pathway. Like the previous model by Joshi and Palsson, it also models physical effects such as osmotic balance. This model was used here to reconstruct the pathology arising from hereditary glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, {{which is the most}} common deficiency in human RBC. Results Since the prototype model could not reproduce the state of G 6 PD deficiency, the model was modified to include a pathway for de novo glutathione synthesis and a glutathione disulfide (GSSG) <b>export</b> <b>system.</b> The de novo glutathione (GSH) synthesis pathway was found to compensate partially for the lowered GSH concentrations resulting from G 6 PD deficiency, with the result that GSSG could be maintained at a very low concentration due to the active <b>export</b> <b>system.</b> Conclusion The results of the simulation were consistent with the estimated situation of real G 6 PD-deficient cells. These results suggest that the de novo glutathione synthesis pathway and the GSSG <b>export</b> <b>system</b> {{play an important role in}} alleviating the consequences of G 6 PD deficiency. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMetallothioneins (MTs) are {{ubiquitous}} metal-binding, cysteine-rich, small proteins {{known to}} provide protection against toxic heavy metals such as cadmium. In {{an attempt to}} increase the ability of bacterial cells to accumulate heavy metals, sheep MTII was produced in fusion with the maltose binding protein (MBP) and localized to the cytoplasmic or periplasmic compartments of Escherichia coli. For all metals tested, higher levels of bioaccumulation were measured with strains over-expressing MBP-MT in comparison with control strains. A marked bioaccumulation of Cd, As, Hg and Zn was observed in the strain over-expressing MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, whereas Cu was accumulated to higher levels when MBP-MT was over-expressed in the periplasm. Metal <b>export</b> <b>systems</b> may {{also play a role}} in this bioaccumulation. To illustrate this, we over-expressed MBP-MT in the cytoplasm of two mutant strains of E. coli affected in metal export. The first, deficient in the transporter ZntA described to export numerous divalent metal ions, showed increasing quantities of Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb being bioaccumulated. The second, strain LF 20012, deficient in As export, showed that As was bioaccumulated in the form of arsenite. Furthermore, high quantities of accumulated metals, chelated by MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, conferred greater metal resistance levels to the cells in the presence of added toxic metals, such as Cd or Hg, while other metals showed toxic effects when the <b>export</b> <b>systems</b> were deficient. The strain over-expressing MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, in combination, with disruption of metal <b>export</b> <b>systems,</b> could be used to develop strategies for bioremediation...|$|R
