5000|$|Astronomical chronology, or astronomical dating, is a {{technical}} method of dating events or artifacts {{that are associated}} with astronomical phenomena. Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the Ancient Near East; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations.

2500|$|Two {{types of}} chronologies can be distinguished: a {{relative}} chronology and an <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology.</b> The former establishes {{the order of}} phases, periods, cultures and reigns, whereas the latter establishes their absolute age expressed in years. In archaeology, relative chronologies are established by carefully excavating archaeological sites and reconstructing their stratigraphy – {{the order in which}} layers were deposited. In general, newer remains are deposited on top of older material. Absolute chronologies are established by dating remains, or the layers in which they are found, through absolute dating methods. These methods include radiocarbon dating and the written record that can provide year names or calendar dates.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{corpus of}} 'direct dates' for rock art {{around the world}} has changed the way {{researchers}} understand rock art. 'Direct dating' refers to methods for obtaining chronometric ages through the dating of material directly associated with motifs, thus providing minimum, maximum or actual ages. Materials associated with rock art that may be directly dated include the original media (e. g. beeswax), organic binders found in pigment, or natural coatings (e. g. wasp nests) which can either provide a terminus ante quem or terminus post quem for art. In Australia, 432 direct dates for rock art are now available, providing the basis for developing <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> for rock art regions and specific periods within them.

40|$|Establishing {{a robust}} {{chronology}} {{is fundamental to}} most palaeoenvironmental studies. However, the number and positioning of dated points is critical. Using a portable luminescence reader, {{it is possible to}} rapidly generate high resolution down core relative age profiles. Profiles of portable luminescence data from two coastal dunes were evaluated and compared with the results of particle size analysis, stratigraphy, and an independent historical chronology. Results show that, even in young samples, portable luminescence data is dominated by an age related signal which in homogeneous sediment need not be corrected for moisture, feldspar content changes or grain size. Profiles therefore provide relative chronologies from which accumulation phases can be established, and from which better targeted sampling and comparison to other sites could be undertaken. Even though they do not provide instant <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies,</b> field-based portable luminescence profiling of Late Quaternary sites hold much potential to improve the resultant chronologies...|$|R

We explored this assumption by searching for evidence of buried impact basins, in the largest occurrences of Early Noachian terrain. The hypothesis is that if such basins exist, they indicate crust which must predate the surface units mapped as the oldest on Mars, and those units must then be less than 4. 6 BY old. Alternatively, if no such buried features are seen, then the surface units may represent crust {{of the same age}} below, which could in principle be as old as Mars. Here we show the former alternative is true. There must be crust older than the oldest mapped surface units. We also show that a number of Noachian terrains on Mars appear to have a common total (visible + buried) crater retention age. This might be either the age of the original (planet-wide?) crust of Mars, or may indicate crater saturation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the ancient}} Near East provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events {{in terms of a}} succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like [...] "in the year X of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a relative chronology is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative chronology can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king Ashur-Dan III refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BCE. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology</b> established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.|$|E

We assess terrestrial and lake sediments using mineralogical, geochemical and statistical techniques and provide <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> by radiocarbon datings and infra-red stimulated luminescence datings including fading correction. Our findings and their discussion in a broader regional context show that there is a Mid Holocene climate optimum. The shift towards warmer and wetter conditions involved changes from Aeolian dynamics of sand mobilization to loess-like sediment accumulation owing to the establishment of dust-trapping vegetation. Between 4 and 2. 8 ka BP we track a decline in moisture supply which is then followed by relatively humid conditions until today. We infer that the region is sensitive to changes of the westerlies dynamics. In addition, we conclude that the Late Holocene was characterized by favorable climatic conditions that probably were an important prerequisite for the repetitive colonization of the Orkhon Valley throughout the last 3000 years...|$|R

These values show oceanographic conditions characterized by a reduced offset between atmospheric and surface water 14 C contents, suggesting a nonexistent or a very weak upwelling and some stratification of the water column.

40|$|The Tharsis Montes volcanoes and Olympus Mons are giant shield volcanoes. Although {{estimates}} of their average surface age {{have been made}} using crater counts, {{the length of time}} required to build the shields has not been considered. Crater counts for the volcanoes indicate the constructs are young; average ages are Amazonian to Hesperian. In relative terms; Arsia Mons is the oldest, Pavonis Mons intermediate, and Ascreaus Mons the youngest of the Tharsis Montes shield; Olympus Mons is the youngest of the group. Depending upon the calibration, absolute ages range from 730 Ma to 3100 Ma for Arsia Mons and 25 Ma to 100 Ma for Olympus Mons. These <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> are highly model dependent, and indicate only the time surficial volcanism ceased, not the time over which the volcano was built. The problem of estimating the time necessary to build the volcanoes can be attacked in two ways. First, eruption rates from terrestrial and extraterrestrial examples can be used to calculate the required period of time to build the shields. Second, some relation of eruptive activity between the volcanoes can be assumed, such as they all began at a speficic time or they were active sequentially, and calculate the eruptive rate.

40|$|Using {{language}} {{to date the}} origin and spread of food production, Archaeology and Language II represents groundbreaking work in synthesizing two disciplines that are now seen as interlinked: linguistics and archaeology. This volume is {{the second part of}} a three-part survey of innovative results emerging from their combination. Archaeology and historical linguistics have largely pursued separate tracks until recently, although their goals can be very similar. While there is a new awareness that these disciplines can be used to complement one another, both rigorous methodological awareness and detailed case-studies are still lacking in the literature. This three-part survey is the first study to address this. Archaeology and Language II examines in some detail how archaeological data can be interpreted through linguistic hypotheses. This collection demonstrates the possibility that, where archaeological sequences are reasonably well-known, they might be tied into evidence of language diversification and thus produce <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies.</b> Where there is evidence for migrations and expansions these can be explored through both disciplines to produce a richer interpretation of prehistory. An important part of this is the origin and spread of food production which can be modelled through the spread of both plants and words for them.

40|$|Ban Chiang is a prehistoric site in {{northeast}} Thailand which was excavated in 1974 and 1975 {{under the direction}} of Chester Gorman of The University Museum, University of Pennsylvania and Pisit Charoenwongsa of the Fine Arts Department of Thailand. The excavators were only able to publish a preliminary report prior to the death of Gorman in 1981. Since the publication of the preliminary report in 1976, it became evident that revisions in the preliminary chronology were necessary, particularly for the dating of the appearance of bronze and iron found at the site. ^ The main goal of this dissertation is to develop a revised chronology for the prehistoric deposit at Ban Chiang based on a stratigraphic interpretation of burial ceramics and radiocarbon dates. A relative chronology of three Periods and ten ceramic phases is proposed. A radiocarbon chronology extending from the fourth millennium B. C. to the early first millennium A.

The ceramic and <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> are compared with other evidence excavated from the region and a reasonably close fit is found.

However, on volcanic flanks, fossil carbon is often not preserved, and of uncertain origin when present in paleosols. Also, low 14 C-volcanic CO 2 may have mixed with atmospheric and soil 14 C-CO 2, potentially causing biased ages.
