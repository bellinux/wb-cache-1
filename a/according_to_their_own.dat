5|$|Early {{settlers}} did not {{adhere to}} traditional architectural practices when constructing houses, but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses {{are no longer}} standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with thatched roofs, resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century. Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and other foreign and indigenous groups lived <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation. As racial segregation eased {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the public display of Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.|$|E

5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|When the French colonized Madagascar in 1896, initial Betsimisaraka {{satisfaction}} {{with the fall of}} the Merina government rapidly evolved into displeasure with French control. This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka, particularly including the bandits and other outlaws who had long been living <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> law in the eastern rainforests; the movement extended to the broader Betsimisaraka population, who mounted a strong resistance to French rule between 1897-1899. These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists.|$|E

40|$|Non-precedential {{judicial}} opinions {{issued by}} the federal appellate courts have generated significant controversy. Given that the federal appellate courts are unlikely to abandon the practice of issuing non-precedential opinions on <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> what other options exist for prohibiting the practice? This article discusses the constitutionality of a procedural rule or statute prohibiting the federal appellate courts from prospectively designating selected opinions as non-precedential. It explains how the rules governing non-precedential opinions allow federal appellate courts to 2 ̆ 2 opt out 2 ̆ 2 of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> rules of precedent. It then examines the rulemaking process, showing how the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are promulgated pursuant to delegated legislative authority and can, therefore, regulate only matters that Congress could regulate by statute. With those premises in mind, the article then explores the constitutional limits of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s ability to regulate the courts 2 ̆ 7 use of precedent. It shows that a federal statute or procedural rule prohibiting prospective designation of selected opinions as non-precedential would be constitutional using both formalist and functionalist reasoning. As long as the statute or rule did not specify the weight federal appellate courts must <b>accord</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> opinions, it would not encroach impermissibly on the courts 2 ̆ 7 Article III judicial power...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{investigation}} the applicability of SSR and ISSR markers in evaluating the genetic relationships in twenty accessions of Aegilops and Triticum species with D genome in different ploidy levels. Totally, 119 bands and 46 alleles were detected using ten primers for ISSR and SSR markers, respectively. Polymorphism Information Content values for all primers ranged from 0. 345 to 0. 375 with an average of 0. 367 for SSR, and varied from 0. 29 to 0. 44 with the average 0. 37 for ISSR marker. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 81 % (ISSR) and 84 % (SSR) of variability was partitioned among individuals within populations. Comparing the genetic diversity of Aegilops and Triticum accessions, based on genetic parameters, shows that genetic variation of Ae. crassa and Ae. tauschii species are higher than other species, especially in terms of Nei’s gene diversity. Cluster analysis, based on both markers, separated total accessions in three groups. However, classification based on SSR marker data was not conformed <b>to</b> classification <b>according</b> <b>to</b> ISSR marker data. Principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA) for SSR and ISSR data showed that, the first two components clarified 53. 48 % and 49. 91 % of the total variation, respectively. This analysis (PCoA), also, indicated consistent patterns of genetic relationships for ISSR data sets, however, the grouping of accessions was not completely <b>accorded</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> geographical origins. Consequently, a high level of genetic diversity was revealed from the accessions sampled from different eco-geographical regions of Iran...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the Oslo Accords, {{the interim}} self-government agreements signed {{between the government}} of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), during the period 1993 - 1995. It suggests that the Israeli recognition of the PLO as the official representative of the Palestinian people did not translate into an acceptance that the Palestinians possessed an equal national right to the territories that both peoples claimed. The acceptance of the PLO as a strategic partner ironically served to consolidate Israel's post- 1967 settlement presence in the West Bank and Gaza strip. It provided Israel with the means to achieve a separation of peoples without a withdrawal from the occupied territories, to keep the land but not its indigenous population. Through {{the structure of the}} Palestinian interim self- governing agreements, the Rabin government sought to 'persuade' the PLO to abandon its goal of Palestinian statehood through a complex co-optation process. In this situation, Israel would control the terms and momentum of the interim period, bringing the PLO into a position of substantial authority under its aegis while simultaneously creating an irreversible fait accompli that would impel the Palestinian leadership to forego its demands for sovereignty and settle for an alternative, permanently sub-sovereign final status arrangement instead. But in contrast to preceding analyses of Oslo, this study argues that these circumstances cannot be wholly interpreted in Realist terms, as an instance of traditional power politics or an act of shrewd statecraft. It is undeniably true that the key Israeli leaders at the time, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, were manipulating the Oslo <b>Accords</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ends, but this deliberative process cannot be fully explained at the level of agency. It must instead be understood as reflecting a new logic of rule that has been explicated in the works of the theorists Gilles Deleuze and Michael Hardt...|$|R
