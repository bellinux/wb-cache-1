25|$|On 21 May 2008, the {{executive}} {{council of the}} Irish Congress of Trade Unions voted to support <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote in the referendum. Rank and file members of the individual unions were not balloted and the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union (TEEU) advised its 45,000 members to vote No. The Irish bishops conference stated the Catholic Church's declaration that the treaty would not weaken Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion, however the conference did not advocate either <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> or No vote. By the start of June, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party had united in their push for <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote despite earlier divisions. The two largest farming organisations, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA) and the Irish Farmers' Association called for <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote, the latter giving its support after assurances from the Taoiseach Brian Cowen that Ireland would use its veto in Europe if a deal on World Trade reform was unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Greece and Rome, beans {{were used}} in voting; a white bean was used to cast <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote, and a black bean for no. Even today, the word koukia (κουκιά) is used unofficially, {{referring}} to the votes. Beans were used as a food for the dead, such as during the annual Lemuria festival.|$|E

25|$|Giffords {{voted against}} President Bush's Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Giffords {{was one of}} 60 lawmakers {{who voted against the}} Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 during its first House vote before {{switching}} to <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote in its second House vote, and she voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.|$|E
25|$|Proposition H {{was a local}} {{ordinance}} on the November 8, 2005 {{ballot in}} San Francisco, California, which gained national attention for its banning of most firearms within the city. The measure passed with <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote of 123,033 to a no vote of 89,856. The proposition was later struck down in court.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of May, the Irish Alliance for Europe {{launched}} its campaign for <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote in the referendum this consisted of trade unionists, business people, academics and politicians. Its members include Garret FitzGerald, Ruairi Quinn, Pat Cox and Michael O'Kennedy. The Taoiseach Brian Cowen stated that should {{any member of the}} Fianna Fáil parliamentary party campaign against the treaty, they would likely be expelled from the party.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} constitutional amendments to allow inclusion of Aboriginal people in censuses and giving the Parliament of Australia the right to introduce legislation specifically for Aboriginal people. In the lead up to the referendum Perkins was manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, an organization that took {{a key role in}} advocating <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote. The constitutional amendment passed with a 90.77% majority.|$|E
25|$|This {{problem is}} known to be NP-complete. It is easy to see that the problem is in NP: <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> answer is easy to prove by {{presenting}} a large enough cut. The NP-completeness of the problem can be shown, for example, by a transformation from maximum 2-satisfiability (a restriction of the maximum satisfiability problem). The weighted version of the decision problem was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems; Karp showed the NP-completeness by a reduction from the partition problem.|$|E
25|$|The Assembly {{was created}} by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which {{followed}} a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following <b>a</b> <b>Yes</b> vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved.|$|E

However, this is far removed from what actually happens...|$|R
25|$|In May 1897, Barton was {{appointed}} {{for the second}} time to the Legislative Council on Reid's recommendations to take charge of the federation bill in the Upper House. This gave Reid's Attorney-General, John Henry Want, a free hand to oppose the bill. In September 1897, the convention met in Sydney to consider 286 proposed amendments from the colonies. It finalised its draft constitution in March 1898 and Barton went back to New South Wales to lead the campaign for <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote in the June referendum. Although it gained majority support, it achieved only 71,595; 80,000 was the minimum number for it to pass.|$|E
25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given <b>a</b> <b>yes.</b> This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{definition}} alone {{it is not}} obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given {{a description of a}} Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then {{the question of whether the}} instance is <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.|$|E

25|$|Having been re-elected unopposed in 1983, Hillery (until then) {{shared the}} {{distinction}} with Seán T. O'Kelly and Éamon de Valera of serving two full terms as President of Ireland. He {{was one of}} three holders of the office of President who did not face popular election for the office, the others being Douglas Hyde and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh. Hillery left office in 1990 (he had served the maximum two terms), widely applauded for his integrity, honesty and devotion to duty. The previous image of Hillery, as low key, dull and unexciting (except for the bizarre sex rumours), had been somewhat undermined. Hillery retired from public life. However he re-entered public life in 2002 during the second referendum on the Nice Treaty, when he urged <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote.|$|E
25|$|He {{then joined}} the Eastern Association {{under the command}} of the Earl of Manchester as a {{volunteer}} at the siege of Lincoln, and on 7 October 1643 he was commissioned as a major in Colonel King's regiment of foot. On 16 May 1644 he was transferred to Manchester's own dragoons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He became friends with Oliver Cromwell, who was second in command, supporting him in his disputes with Manchester. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Shortly afterwards he asked permission to attack the Royalist stronghold at Tickhill Castle, because he had heard it was willing to surrender. Manchester refused, dismissing him as a madman. Taking that as <b>a</b> <b>yes,</b> he went and took the Castle without a shot being fired.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Thiệu, the siege of the barracks started, and rebel {{artillery}} shells soon reduced the buildings to rubble, but the pro-Diệm loyalists fought on, a scant five blocks from the palace. Presidential Guard tanks returned fire, severely damaging nearby roadways. After an hour, Diệm and Nhu suspected that something was amiss and attempted to call Đính's office {{for a second time}} and again were told Đính was not there. Not believing Đính had double-crossed them, the Ngô brothers were heard in the background speculating that Đính had been arrested by the rebels. The generals then phoned Gia Long Palace with an ultimatum. If Diệm resigned immediately, he and Nhu would be safely exiled. If he did not, they would launch air strikes and start shelling the palace within the hour. The generals said {{that there would be no}} negotiation, only <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> or no would be acceptable. Diệm made no reply.|$|E

25|$|A {{referendum}} {{was held}} in neighboring Djibouti (then known as French Somaliland) in 1958, {{on the eve of}} Somalia's independence in 1960, {{to decide whether or not}} to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali who had campaigned for <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as Djibouti's first president (1977–1991).|$|E
25|$|The {{union of}} the two states proved {{problematic}} early on when in a referendum held on 20 June 1961 to approve the provisional constitution that would govern the two ex-colonial territories was rejected by half {{of the population in}} the Somaliland (the north-west of nascent Somali Republic), the major cities of the former British protectorate voted against the ratification of the constitution - Hargeisa (72%), Berbera (69%), Burao (66%) and Erigavo (69%) - all returned negative votes. This was in contrast to the south (ex-Italian colony) which returned a strong support for the constitution (and four times the expected vote numbers in the south, indicating electoral fraud, an example of this is a small southern village called Wanla Weyn registered <b>a</b> <b>yes</b> vote higher than the 100,000 votes counted in all of the north), this was major signal of discontent coming from the north only a year after forming the union. Another example of the simmering discontent in the north was a coup attempt by northern officers that was thwarted in 1961.|$|E

In early 2011, the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long-serving government, which were associated with the larger Arab Spring demonstrations. The unrest eventually subsided by April of the year, and Djibouti's ruling People's Rally for Progress party was re-elected to office.|$|E
