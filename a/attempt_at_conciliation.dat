Filled with conflicting emotions, Stiffelio drops his sword, asks God to inspire his speech to his parishioners, but, at the same time, curses his wife.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ernest Belfort Bax, Freemasons were {{responsible}} for the last serious <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> between Versailles and the Paris Commune on 21 April 1871. They were received coldly by Adolphe Thiers, who assured them that, though Paris was given over to destruction and slaughter, the law should be enforced, and he kept his word. A few days after they decided, in a public meeting, to plant their banner on the ramparts and throw in their lot with the Commune. On the 29th, accordingly, 10,000 of the brethren met (55 lodges being represented), and marched to the Hôtel de Ville, headed by the Grand Masters in full insignia and the banners of the lodges. Amongst them the new banner of Vincennes was conspicuous, bearing the inscription in red letters on a white ground, [...] "Love one another." [...] A balloon was then sent up, which let fall at intervals, outside Paris, a manifesto of the Freemasons. The procession then wended its way through the boulevards and the Champs Elysées to the Arc de Triomphe, where the banners were planted at various points along the ramparts. On seeing the white flag on the Porte Maillot the Versaillese ceased firing, and the commander, himself a Freemason, received a deputation of brethren, and suggested a final appeal to Versailles, which was agreed to. The [...] "chief of the executive" [...] hardly listened to the envoys, and declined to further discuss the question of peace with anyone.

2500|$|On 31 December 2011, the FA {{released}} {{the contents of}} their findings. In the 115-page report, the FA said that Suárez [...] "damaged the image of English football around the world". The FA, while finding Evra to be a credible witness, declared that Suárez's evidence was unreliable and inconsistent with the video footage. According to Evra's testimony, Suárez said in Spanish that he had earlier kicked Evra [...] "because you are black", said [...] "I don't speak to blacks" [...] and used the word [...] "negro" [...] five times in total as they argued. Suárez had claimed that {{he used the word}} 'negro' only once to address Evra and this was intended to be conciliatory and friendly, but the FA rejected this claim as being [...] "unsustainable and simply incredible given that the players were engaged in an acrimonious argument". As the conversation between Suárez and Evra took place in Spanish, linguistic experts were called in to help the panel with the meaning of the phrases. The panel concluded that [...] "Suárez's use of the term [...] was not intended as an <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> or to establish rapport; neither was it meant in a conciliatory and friendly way". Suárez was also warned that two similar offences in the future could lead to [...] "a permanent suspension". In January 2012, Liverpool announced that they would not appeal the punishment handed to Suárez, releasing a statement voicing their support [...] "to stamp out racism in every form, inside and outside the sport", adding that it was [...] "for this reason that Liverpool will not appeal the eight-game suspension of Luis Suárez". However, Liverpool continued to maintain their belief in both Suárez's innocence and a [...] "strongly held conviction" [...] that the Football Association and the panel it selected [...] "constructed a highly subjective case...based on an accusation that was ultimately unsubstantiated". Suárez subsequently made an official statement in which he thanked everybody who had shown support for him, and declared that he was [...] "upset" [...] at the decision to ban him, and that he would [...] "carry out the suspension with the resignation of someone who hasn't done anything wrong and who feels extremely upset by the events", but refused to offer a direct apology to Evra.|$|E

Hard words he could have returned, violence he would have repaid with interest; but this cool, complacent, contemptuous, self-possessed reception, caused him to feel his inferiority more completely than the most elaborate arguments. Everything contributed to this effect. His own rough speech, contrasted with the soft persuasive accents of the other; his rude bearing, and Mr Chester's polished manner; the disorder and negligence of his ragged dress, and the elegant attire he saw before him; with all the unaccustomed luxuries and comforts of the room, and the silence that gave him leisure to observe these things, and feel how ill at ease they made him; all these influences, which have too often some effect on tutored minds and become of almost resistless power when {{brought to bear on}} such a mind as his, quelled Hugh completely.

5|$|By July, <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> had {{completely}} collapsed. Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|R
500|$|Her parents' {{relationship}} was quarrelsome; Marguerite Louise took every chance to humiliate Cosimo. On one documented occasion, she branded him [...] "a poor groom" [...] {{in the presence}} of the Papal nuncio. The enmity between them continued until 26 December 1674; after all <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> failed, a stressed Cosimo consented to his wife's departure for the Convent of Montmartre, France. The contract created that day revoked her privileges as a petite fille de France, and declared that upon her death all her assets were to be inherited by her children. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She abandoned Tuscany in June 1675; Anna Maria Luisa never saw her again. Although Cosimo doted on his daughter, she was raised by her paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|R

The federalists (Morvan Marchal, Yann-Morvan Gefflot, Goulven Mazéas, René-Yves Creston, Le Men, Abeozen) went on to create the Breton Federalist League whose new journal was Federal Brittany.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian Church had not {{accepted}} {{the conclusions of}} the Council of Chalcedon, which had defined that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', thus condemning monophysitism and miaphysitism, which insisted on the unification of human and divine natures into Christ.

It reminded bishops of the condemnation of Nestorian doctrine, which emphasized the human nature of Christ, and did not mention the Chalcedonian diaphysitic creed. The First Council of Dvin was thus able to accept the Henotikon and keep open a possibility of conciliation with the Patriarchate of Constantinople while remaining steady in its christological doctrine.|$|E
5000|$|As {{much of the}} {{conversation}} between Suárez and Evra {{had taken place in}} Spanish, linguistic experts were called in to help the panel with the meaning of the phrases. Although the FA's linguistic experts stated that Evra's version of what Suarez had said struck them as “slightly unusual”, whereas the phrase claimed by Suarez “sounded right linguistically and culturally”, and [...] "if Mr Suarez used the word “negro” as described by Mr Suarez, this would not be interpreted as either offensive or offensive in racial terms in Uruguay and Spanish-speaking America more generally", the FA panel concluded that [...] "Suárez's use of the term negro was not intended as an <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> or to establish rapport; neither was it meant in a conciliatory and friendly way".

5|$|The {{failure and}} brutal {{suppression}} of Muhammad and Ibrahim's revolt {{was followed by}} a large-scale reprisal campaign against the Alids, many of whom were imprisoned or killed, until the death of al-Mansur brought about another period of <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> under al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), which ended after another Alid uprising in 786. The relationship of the Abbasids with the Alids remained troubled: periods of repression, usually following pro-Alid revolts, were alternated with periods of relative tolerance. Although al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) at one point nominated an Alid, Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, as his heir during the Fourth Fitna, this move was not followed up, and under Ma'mun's successors, the two families became completely estranged. Of Muhammad's sons and brothers, many fled the Abbasid persecution to the remoter corners of the Caliphate, where they sometimes succeeded in establishing local dynasties, e.g. the Idrisids of Morocco, founded by Muhammad's brother Idris, or the Alavids in Tabaristan.|$|R
5000|$|The Temple Lot is {{currently}} {{owned by the}} small Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which acquired the land in 1867.

Currently this body has its headquarters on the site, which has twice been damaged by arson attacks. The Temple Lot church has insisted since about 1976 (when final <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> by the RLDS Church took place) that it will not cooperate with other Latter Day Saint or Christian denominations in building a temple, nor will it sell the Lot, regardless of any price that might conceivably be offered.

So he said that he would return them an answer to the petition by-and-by, and he immediately began to pursue a more conciliatory course toward the nobles. But the effect of his <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> was spoiled by Gaveston's behavior. He became more and more proud and ostentatious every day. He appeared in all public places, and every where he took precedence of the highest nobles of the land, and prided himself on outshining them in the pomp and parade which he displayed. He attended all the jousts and tournaments, and, as he was really a very handsome and well-formed man, and well skilled in the warlike sports in fashion in those days, he bore away most of the great prizes. He thus successfully rivaled the other nobles in gaining the admiration of the ladies of the court and the applause of the multitude, and made the nobles hate him more than ever.|$|R

During the period of his nunciature, John visited all parts of the Empire, preaching and combating the heresy of the Hussites; he also visited Poland at the request of Casimir IV Jagiellon. As legate, or inquisitor, he prosecuted the last Fraticelli of Ferrara, the Jesuati of Venice, the Crypto-Jews of Sicily, Moldavia and Poland, and, above all, the Hussites of Germany, Hungary and Bohemia; his aim in the last case was to make talks impossible between the representatives of Rome and the Bohemians, for every <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> seemed to him to be conniving at heresy.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Hadrian {{intended}} to assimilate the Jewish Temple into the civic-religious basis of support to his reign, {{as he had done}} with Greek and other traditional places of worship. It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a basis of support for his autocratic legitimacy - a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo. The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenisation and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones. Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenised Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of the Jewish revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos ("Highest") on Mount Gerizim. This <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> between Judaism and Hellenism foundered when faced with strict Jewish monotheism. Therefore, the Romans appear to have been surprised by the outbreak of the uprising.|$|E

5000|$|Saint-Domingue {{had been}} a French colony since 1697, but had been in {{rebellion}} against France since 1791. Napoleon wished to restore French authority there, and so organized an expedition. He put General Leclerc at its head, appointing him Governor-General of the island. Leclerc, Dermide, and Pauline embarked for the colony from Brest on 14 December 1801. Leclerc's fleet totaled 74 ships. The gubernatorial family occupied the flagship, l'Océan. After a 45-day journey, the fleet arrived in Le Cap harbour. The Governor-General ordered General Christophe, who commanded a force of 5,000 soldiers, to resign Le Cap to French authority. After all <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> failed, Leclerc attacked the town under cover of darkness. Christophe responded by razing Le Cap to the ground.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on recent reforms of the Italian Civil Procedure Code through which a new section 185 -bis had been added, {{providing}} that the Judge, at the first hearing or until the termination of the evidence-taking phase of the proceedings, may suggest to the parties a settlement or conciliation proposal, when appropriate to the nature {{and the value of}} the dispute and the issues of prompt solution at law. The author’s intent is, on the one hand, to identify the rationale of the new rule and, on the other hand, to emphasize that unfortunately the new rule does not reverse misfortunes of Italian civil justice, but rather gives rise to many difficulties of interpretation. With this purpose, this article first investigates the distinctive traits of the various <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, taking into consideration not only the current version of the rules but also the provisions which have followed one another over time. It follows a detailed examination of the elements of the proposal under sect. 185 -bis, as to the timeframe, its discretional or mandatory nature, sanctions for the party’s unjustified refusal as well as the role of the Judge with respect to his or her decision-making function. </span...|$|R

He {{set out from}} Montreal on 10 September, and reached Detroit on 20 October. From this date until 1751, leaving the loyal Hurons in the keeping of Father Potier at the Detroit village, he directed all his energies to reclaiming Nicolas Orontondi's band of insurgent Hurons. These had already in 1740, owing to a bloody feud with the Detroit Ottawas and to the reluctance, if not refusal, of Governor Beauharnais to let the Hurons remove to Montreal, sullenly left Detroit and settled at [...] "Little Lake" [...] (now Rondeau Harbour) near Sandusky.

Until his death, which occurred some time after September 1749, Orontondi continued to intrigue with the English emissaries, the Iroquois, and the disaffected Miamis.

Her coronation as queen of Hungary took place in St. Martins Cathedral, Pressburg on 25 June 1741 after she had spent months honing the equestrian skills necessary for the ceremony and negotiating with the Diet.To appease those who considered her sex to be the most serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen. No 18th-century commentary saw this crossing of gendered titles as inappropriate or impossible.By July, <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> had completely collapsed. Maria Theresas ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and George II declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen was once again in need of help from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|R

The Byzantines allowed these freedom and archbishop Elias, already called patriarch by his suffragans, built a cathedral under the patronage of St. Euphemia as an unabashed statement of his {{adherence to the}} schism since it was the church of St. Euphemia in which the sessions of the Council of Chalcedon were approved. Gregory the Great's <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> <b>conciliation</b> {{near the end of}} his pontificate, and especially through the Lombard queen, Theodelinda, began to have some effect. Thus, in 606, Elias's successor Severus died and there were many clerics favorable to reconciliation. The Byzantines encouraged these to elect Candidianus who once elected promptly restored communion. However, certain stalwart clerics were unhappy and having fled to mainland Aquileia under Lombard protection elected a John as a rival bishop who maintained the schism. Thus, the schism deepened now along political Lombard-Roman lines. Columbanus was involved in the first attempt to resolve this division through mediation in 613. The bishop of [...] "old" [...] Aquileia formally ended the schism at the Synod of Aquileia in 698, only after the Lombards embraced Orthodoxy in the 7th century. The division of the Patriarchate of Aquileia contributed to the evolution of the Patriarch of Grado into the present Patriarch of Venice.|$|R
