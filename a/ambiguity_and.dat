5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of <b>ambiguity</b> <b>and</b> darkness. Many of the {{employees}} are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, <b>ambiguity</b> <b>and</b> contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of the Screw. The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its <b>ambiguity,</b> <b>and</b> critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent <b>ambiguity</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his own citizens, and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all <b>ambiguity</b> <b>and</b> extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to rebuild their churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E

40|$|Ambiguity {{resolution}} {{is the key}} to precise positioning applications with GPS (Global Positioning System) carrier phase measurements. The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of integrating high quality inertial data into GPS On-the-Fly (OTF) <b>ambiguity</b> resolution <b>and</b> cycle slip detection. A key factor to an ambiguity search procedure is the accuracy of the float ambiguities. The superior navigation accuracy over the short term provided by a high quality INS (Inertial Navigation System) can improve the precision of the initial float <b>ambiguities,</b> <b>and</b> the integration of inertial data into the ambiguity filtering process can yield more accurate float <b>ambiguities</b> <b>and</b> thus facilitate the integer search procedure. In this thesis, inertial aiding in the FASF (Fast Ambiguity Search Filtering) ambiguity {{resolution is}} examined in theory under three INS/GPS integration scenarios: loose and tight coupling integration in a decentralized filter structure, and an augmented master filter integration in a centralized filter structure. The ambiguity dilution precision (ADOP), which measures the accuracy of the float <b>ambiguities</b> <b>and</b> the size of the search space, is investigated. To evaluate the performanc...|$|R

25|$|The {{second set}} of Préludes for piano (1913) {{features}} Debussy at his most avant-garde, where he uses dissonant harmonies to evoke specific moods and images.

He uses scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Préludes for piano represents his strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory that}} has been posited {{to account for the}} {{occurrence}} of accusative systems is that of functional pressure.

So, it has been proposed that the accusative system arose from a functional pressure to avoid <b>ambiguity</b> <b>and</b> make communication a simpler process.|$|E
