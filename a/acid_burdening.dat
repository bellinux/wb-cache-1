40|$|Esophageal atresia {{patients}} are predisposed to gastroesophageal reflux {{as a result}} of the altered esophageal anatomy and motility. These patients experience significant morbidity from gastroesophageal reflux. As a result, an effective way to diagnose and monitor for reflux is crucial. pH-metry is able to quantify <b>acid</b> <b>burden,</b> ensure that <b>acid</b> suppression is adequate during long-term follow-up, and correlate acid reflux to symptoms. pH with impedance is additionally able to detect non-acid reflux as well as volume clearance, both of which also correlate with patient symptoms. It is also able to correlate extra-gastrointestinal symptoms to reflux, which may help guide treatment. If complications associated with uncontrolled reflux are identified, aggressive reflux management is necessary, oftentimes requiring surgical intervention...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} and critiques {{a series}} of reports on the health effects of acid aerosol exposure, presented at the Symposium on the Health Effects of Acid Aerosols and compares these data to selected previous studies. The role of the two major defenses against acid aerosols, the conversion of acid to the ammonium salts by respiratory ammonia and buffering of acid by airway surface liquid are discussed in relation to airway <b>acid</b> <b>burdens</b> expected from typical inhalation exposures. The roles of particle size and hygroscopicity on airway deposition of aerosol are also included. The major health effects studied were the effects of acid aerosol on mucociliary clearance in healthy individuals and changes in lung function in asthmatics, an important sensitive subpopulation. The broad range of response in asthmatics suggests the need for further study. The level of complexity involved in investigating the human health effects of airborne acidic compounds is considerably greater than that for common gaseous pollutants such as ozone. A comprehensive understanding of the issues involved in the generation of chamber exposure atmospheres, deposition, and neutralizatio...|$|R
40|$|Objective Gastro-oesophageal reflux is {{considered}} to be an important contributing factor in chronic unexplained cough. It remains unclear why some reflux episodes in the same patient causes cough while others do not. To understand more about the mechanism by which reflux induces cough, we aimed to identify factors which are important in triggering cough. Design In this multicentre study, 49 patients with reflux-associated chronic cough were analysed using 24 -hour pH-impedance-pressure monitoring. The characteristics of reflux episodes that were followed by cough were compared with reflux episodes not associated with cough. Results The majority (72. 4 %) of the reflux episodes were acidic (pH < 4). Compared with reflux episodes that were not followed by cough, reflux episodes that were followed by a cough burst were associated with a higher proximal extent (p= 0. 0001), a higher volume clearance time (p= 0. 002) and a higher <b>acid</b> <b>burden</b> in the preceding 15 min window (p= 0. 019) and higher reflux burden in the preceding 30 min window (p= 0. 044). No significant difference was found between the two groups when looking at the nadir pH, the pH drop, the acid clearance time or the percentage of reflux episodes which were acidic. Conclusions The presence of a larger volume of refluxate and oesophageal exposure to reflux {{for a longer period of}} time seems to play an important role in inducing cough, while the acidity of the refluxate seems to be less relevant. This helps explain the observation that most patients with chronic cough tend not to benefit from acid inhibitory treatmen...|$|R
40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux is {{considered}} to be the most common gastrointestinal cause of non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP). It remains unclear why some reflux episodes in the same patient cause chest pain while others do not. To understand more about the mechanisms by which reflux elicits chest pain, we aimed to identify factors which are important in triggering chest pain. In this multicenter study, 120 patients with NCCP were analyzed using 24 -h pH-impedance monitoring. In the patients with a positive association between reflux and chest pain, the characteristics of the reflux episodes which were followed by a chest pain episode were compared with chest pain-free reflux episodes. Using 24 -h pH-impedance monitoring, 40 % of the NCCP patients were identified as having reflux as a possible cause of their chest pain. Reflux episodes that were associated with chest pain had a higher proximal extent (P= 0. 007), a higher volume clearance time (P= 0. 030), a higher 15 -minute <b>acid</b> <b>burden</b> (P= 0. 041), were more often acidic (P= 0. 011), had a lower nadir pH (P= 0. 044), and had a longer acid duration time (P= 0. 027) than reflux episodes which were not followed by chest pain. Patients who experienced typical reflux symptoms {{were more likely to have}} reflux as the cause of their chest pain (52 vs. 31. 4 %, P= 0. 023). The presence of a larger volume of acid refluxate for a longer period of time appears to be an important determinant of perceiving a reflux episode as chest pain. 24 -h pH-impedance monitoring is an important tool in identifying gastroesophageal reflux as a potential cause of symptoms in patients with NCC...|$|R
40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a multifactorial disease. Although it is {{primarily}} a motility disorder, several other disturbances can interfere and contribute to determine the severity of symptoms {{and the degree of}} lesions. In normal subjects, as in patients with pathological reflux, nearly all the episodes of reflux obey one of the following three mechanisms: (a) a transient complete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (TLOSR), (b) a transient increase in intra-abdominal pressure which overcomes the resistance of the antireflux barrier ('stress reflux') and, (c) a spontaneous reflux through a permanently hypotonic sphincter. Gastric distension is the major factor that can induce TLOSRs. Whereas, at rest, the diaphragm probably plays little role in cardial competence, diaphragmatic contraction may help prevent reflux in conditions resulting in increased abdominal pressure such as during physical activity and abdominal staining. The presence of a hiatal hernia increases susceptibility to reflux. A delayed gastric emptying may also facilitate reflux and represents a factor of resistance to antireflux therapy. Most studies in humans have shown that motor abnormalities remain unchanged after healing of oesophagitis. Acid and pepsin are the most noxious agents of the upper gastrointestinal secretions that can participate in the pathogenesis of oesophagitis. However, {{there is no evidence that}} patients with reflux have greater acid secretion than subjects without reflux. The clearance function is a two-stage phenomenon requiring first a reduction in volume by peristalsis and then chemical neutralization by saliva. Primary peristalsis is mainly responsible for the clearance of acid in both the upright and the supine positions. It takes longer to clear acid in patients with non-reducing hiatal hernia. The layer of mucus which carpets the mucosa comes from the saliva and also from the submucosal glands of the oesophagus. The paracellular pathway is the major route by which mucosal HCl enters and then damages the oesophageal epithelium. Only a minority of acid reflux episodes are accompanied by symptoms. The acid exposure during the time period that precedes a reflux episode (i. e. the <b>acid</b> <b>burden)</b> is a key factor determining whether that reflux episode will be symptomatic or asymptomatic. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a broad range}} of experiments based on an aerosol flow-tube system to probe the interactions between atmospherically relevant aerosols with trace gases. This apparatus was used to obtain simultaneous optical and size distribution measurements using FTIR and SMPS measurements respectively as a function of relative humidity and aerosol chemical composition. Heterogeneous reactions between various ratios of ammonia gas and acidic aerosols were studied in aerosol form as opposed to bulk solutions. The apparatus is unique, in that it employed two aerosol generation methods to follow the size evolution of the aerosol while allowing detailed spectroscopic investigation of its chemical content. A novel chemiluminescence apparatus was also used to measure [NH 4 +]. SO 2. H 2 O is an important species as it represents the first intermediate in the overall atmospheric oxidation process of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid. This complex was produced within gaseous, aqueous and aerosol SO 2 systems. The addition of ammonia, gave mainly hydrogen sulfite tautomers and disulfite ions. These species were prevalent at high humidities enhancing the aqueous nature of sulfur (IV) species. Their weak acidity is evident due to the low [NH 4 +] produced. An increasing recognition that dicarboxylic acids may contribute significantly to the total <b>acid</b> <b>burden</b> in polluted urban environments is evident in the literature. It was observed that speciation within the oxalic, malonic and succinic systems shifted towards the most ionised form as the relative humidity was increased due to complete protonisation. The addition of ammonia produced ammonium dicarboxylate ions. Less reaction for ammonia with the malonic and succinic species were observed in comparison to the oxalic acid system. This observation coincides with the decrease in acidity of these organic species. The interaction between dicarboxylic acids and ‘sulfurous’/sulfuric acid has not been previously investigated. Therefore the results presented here are original to the field of tropospheric chemistry. SHO 3 -; S 2 O 52 -; HSO 4 -; SO 42 - and H 1, 3, 5 C 2, 3, 4 O 4 -;C 2, 3, 4 O 4 2 - were the main components found in the complex inorganic-organic systems investigated here. The introduction of ammonia produced ammonium dicarboxylate as well as ammonium disulfite/sulfate ions and increasing the acid concentrations increased the total amount of [NH 4 +]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients with {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma frequently {{present with}} depression {{the symptoms of}} which may precede cancer diagnosis, suggesting that the pathophysiology of depression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may result from biological changes that are induced {{by the presence of}} the tumour itself. The present study was conducted to test a hypothesized relationship with the kynurenine pathway, which has been implicated in both depression and tumour-induced immunosuppression. Methods 17 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were recruited and completed mood questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Pancreatic Cancer, Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory) and blood testing for serum levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid and quinolinic <b>acid.</b> Tumour <b>burden</b> was determined from pathology reports (tumour size and nodal involvement). ResultsFindings indicated a negative correlation between mood scores and the plasma kynurenic acid : tryptophan ratio in plasma, and a positive correlation between tumour burden and plasma kynurenine level. ConclusionsThis study suggests that pancreatic cancer may influence mood via the kynurenine pathway. The relationship of the kynurenine pathway with pancreatic tumour burden should be explored further in large multicentre studies because a better understanding of this physiology might have significant clinical benefit...|$|R
40|$|Background:: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) is {{a chronic}} debilitating disease endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, caused by protozoan parasites {{of the genus}} Leishmania. Annually, it is estimated the occurrence of 0. 2 to 0. 4 million new cases of the disease worldwide. Considering {{the lack of an}} effective vaccine the afflicted population must rely on both, an accurate diagnosis and successful treatment to combat the disease. Here we propose to evaluate the efficacy of trivalent antimonial encapsulated in conventional liposomes, in association with ascorbic acid, by monitoring its toxicity and efficacy in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania infantum. Methodology/Principal Findings:: Infected mice were subjected to single-dose treatments consisting in the administration of either free or liposome-encapsulated trivalent antimony (SbIII), in association or not with ascorbic <b>acid.</b> Parasite <b>burden</b> was assessed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow using the serial limiting dilution technique.

40|$|Background Bisphosphonates exhibit direct {{antitumor}} {{activity in}} animal models, {{but only at}} high doses that are incompatible with the clinical dosing regimens approved {{for the treatment of}} cancer patients with skeletal metastases. We compared the antitumor effects of clinical dosing regimens of the bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and clodronate in a mouse model of bone metastasis. Methods Mice (n = 6 - 10 per group) were treated with zoledronic acid, clodronate, or vehicle starting before (preventive protocols) or after (treatment protocols) intravenous injection with human B 02 /GFP. 2 breast cancer cells, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase and metastasize to bone. Zoledronic acid was given as daily, weekly, or single doses at a cumulative dose of 98 - 100 μg/kg body weight, equivalent to the 4 -mg intravenous dose given to patients. Clodronate was given as a daily dose (530 μg/kg/day), equivalent to the daily 1600 -mg oral clinical dose given to patients. Bone destruction was measured by radiography, x-ray absorptiometry or tomography, and histomorphometry (as the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume). Skeletal tumor burden was measured by histomorphometry (as the ratio of tumor burden to soft tissue volume [TB/STV]) and luciferase activity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results In treatment protocols, daily clodronate was less effective at decreasing the TB/STV ratio than daily (53 % versus 87 %, difference = 34 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 16 % to 44 %, P<. 001) or weekly (53 % versus 90 %, difference = 37 %, 95 % CI = 19 % to 46 %, P<. 001) zoledronic acid-dosing regimens. Compared with vehicle, a single dose of zoledronic <b>acid</b> decreased tumor <b>burden</b> by only 16 % (95 % CI = 9 % to 22 %, P<. 001). In preventive protocols, daily clodronate and daily or weekly zoledronic acid decreased the TB/STV ratio by 49 % (95 % CI = 40 % to 57 %, P =. 006), 83 % (95 % CI = 68 % to 98 %, P<. 001), and 66 % (95 % CI = 47 % to 84 %, P<. 001), respectively, compared with vehicle, whereas a single dose of zoledronic <b>acid</b> decreased tumor <b>burden</b> by only 13 % (95 % CI = − 2 % to 28 %, P =. 84).
