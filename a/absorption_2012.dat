40|$|Aiming {{to explore}} {{cooperative}} interactions between plasmonic metal and semiconductor nanostructures {{as well as}} their special plasmon resonant properties, we synthesized Au@Cu 2 O core-shell nanoparticles to demonstrate the dramatic influence of dielectric shell both experimentally and theoretically. The extinction spectra of Au@Cu 2 O nanoparticles with controllable shell thickness from a few layers to over 20 nm show not only a tunable red shift of resonant peak but also distinctive enhanced absorption intensity and peak splitting. We then built an analytical model based on an approximate Mie's theory to interpret their optical features. From this model, we found that the overall optical cross section and absorption portion of Au@Cu 2 O are dramatically enlarged. It has been shown that the proper dielectric shell-coated plasmonic nanoparticles could be very promising, especially for the applications that need effective enhancement of the plasmon resonant <b>absorption.</b> 漏 <b>2012</b> American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|A {{sandwich}} of polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers {{between two}} electrodeposited reduced graphene oxide (RGO) layers was prepared by an electrochemical method. The structure and compositions were characterised by field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The electrical properties were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The FESEM results confirmed synthesis of a sandwich structure with PPy nanofibers between two electrodeposited RGO layers (RGO/PPy/RGO). The mean width of PPy nanofibers was approximately 76 +/- 16 nm. The EIS {{results showed that the}} charge transfer resistance of the coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a sandwich structure of RGO/PPy/RGO was significantly decreased in comparison with coated GCE with PPy nanofibers. This was because the RGO with many small band gaps is more favourable for electron conduction. The comparison of EIS results shows that diffusion of active species through the RGO layers is increased {{in the presence of the}} second layer of RGO. The simulation results indicate a high interfacial capacitance (C-dl) of 2170. 60 mu F cm(- 2) for the coated GCE with RGO/PPy/RGO compared with 360. 77 mu F cm(- 2) for coated GCE with PPy/RGO. This difference in capacitance can be attributed to the highly accessible specific surface area of graphene and its high efficiency towards electrolyte ion <b>absorption.</b> (C) <b>2012</b> Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Acoustical dampers {{are used}} {{in order to avoid}} the noise propagation. Well known {{examples}} are the aero-engine liners, the IC-engine exhaust muffers, and the liners in combustion chambers. These devices comprise wall perforations, responsible for their sound absorbing features. Understanding the effect of the flow on the acoustic properties of a perforation is essential for the design of acoustic dampers. In the present work the effect of grazing flow on the impedance of slit shaped wall perforations is experimentally investigated by means of a multi-microphone impedance tube. Measurements are carried out for perforations with different geometries. The focus of the experiments is on the Strouhal number dependence of the acoustic impedance. An analytical model of the aeroacoustic behaviour of a two-dimensional wall perforation subject to grazing flow is proposed.

The total atmospheric SCCP levels ranged 1. 9 - 33. 0 ng/m(3) during wintertime. Significantly higher levels were found during the summer (range 112 - 332 ng/m(3)). The average fraction of total SCCPs in the particle phase (phi) was 0. 67 during wintertime but decreased significantly during the summer (phi = 0. 06).

Pramipexole was analyzed by LC-MS-MS {{in the presence of}} Tansulosina as internal standard. The mean ratio of parameters C max. and AUC 0 -t and 90 % confidence intervals of correspondents were calculated to determine the bioequivalence.

Geometric mean of pramipezan® (pramipexole) /Sifrol® 0. 125 mg individual percent ratio was 103. 61 % AUC 0 -t, 103. 13 % for AUC 0 -∞ and 100. 81 % for C max.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} {{theory of the}} magnetic field dependence of the optical properties of II-VI semiconductor quantum dots containing a single magnetic (Mn) impurity. The single-particle electron and heavy-hole states are described exactly by two-dimensional harmonic oscillators in a magnetic field, the Mn ion is treated as a spin of an isoelectronic impurity, and the quantum dot anisotropy is included perturbatively. The electron-hole direct, short-, and long-range exchange electron-hole Coulomb interactions, {{as well as the}} short-range spin-spin contact exchange interaction of the electron and the hole with the magnetic impurity is included. The electron-hole-Mn states are expanded in a finite number of configurations controlled by the number of confined electronic quantum dot shells and the full interacting Hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically in this basis. The absorption and emission spectrum is predicted as a function of photon energy, magnetic field, number of confined shells, and anisotropy. It is shown that the magnetic-field-induced enhancement of the exchange interaction of the Mn spin with the exciton is largely canceled by increased electron-hole Coulomb interactions. The predicted weak magnetic field dependence of the spacing of emission lines agrees well with the results of the spin model at low magnetic fields but differs at higher magnetic fields.

This work is to propose the method to form fine-particle slurry of LiBr crystal and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the slurry for advancement of the absorption performance in LiBr/water AHP. It was found that the fine particle slurry of LiBr crystal is formed stably in the solution under a super saturation condition when zeolite powder is suspended. This phenomenon is considered to take place since the crystal grows around the zeolite particles by a function as nucleus. Then almost saturated concentration is maintained due to dissolution of the crystal even if the solution is diluted by absorption of water vapor in the absorber. The theoretical analysis based on heat and mass transfer model predicted that the output power of AHP was improved up to twice when compared with the conventional solution in lower concentration than saturation solubility without containing any fine powder of adsorbent or crystal. The measurement of the slurry properties and experiment on heat transfer of slurry film flowing on a heat transfer plate was carried out, and the effectiveness of the slurry as well as the reasonability of the modeling was confirmed. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, <b>2012.</b> <b>Absorption</b> refrigeration systems, despite having numerous advantages, are generally characterized by low Coefficient of Performance (COP). Absorption enhancement has been considered an effective way of improving the COP of the refrigeration systems, and magnetic enhancement is one of these. The literature is sparse {{on the use of}} magnetic field for the enhancement of absorption refrigeration systems. A numerical model of magnetic field enhancement in ammonia- water absorption systems is presented in this paper. The flow within the film thickness to the absorber wall was considered as two-dimensional steady laminar flow. A finite difference model was developed based on the conservation of mass, momentum, energy equations and mass transport relationship. Macroscopic magnetic field force was introduced in the model equations. The model was validated using data obtained from the literature on ammonia solution. Changes in the physical properties of ammonia solution while absorbing, both in the direction of falling film and across its thickness, were investigated. The distribution of the physical properties of ammonia solution within the film-thickness was not significantly different (p< 0. 05) from results in the literature. The magnetic field was found to have positive effect on the ammonia-water falling film absorption to some degree. When magnetic induction intensity at the solution’s inlet was 1. 4 and 3 Tesla (T), the increments in concentration of ammonia solution at outlet was 0. 004 and 0. 01, respectively. Relative to 0. 0 Tesla, the COP of simple ammonia solution absorption refrigeration system increased by 1. 9 % and 3. 6 % for magnetic induction of 1. 4 and 3. 0 Tesla respectively.
