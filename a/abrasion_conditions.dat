This study evaluated the effect of surface treatments on the shear bond strength (SBS) of a resin cement to commercially pure titanium (CP Ti). Ninety cast CP Ti discs were divided into 3 groups (n= 30), which received one of the following airborne-particle abrasion conditions: (1) 50 ?m Al 2 O 3 particles; (2) 30 ?m silica-modified Al 2 O 3 particles (Cojet Sand); (3) 110 ?m silica-modified Al 2 O 3 particles (Rocatec).

40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of harsh environments in mining, processing and transporting ore and related waste, cause severe wear, extremely high maintenance costs and lost production. Elevated temperature processing {{is one of}} the conditions that influence the performance of possible materials of construction. This takes the forms of reduced hardness and strength, deleterious changes in the structure and properties of materials during protracted exposure and increased oxidation and corrosion. Drag chain conveying of hot solids e. g. in smelting, typically results in three-body sliding abrasion and adhesive wear of connecting pins and hole surfaces in link assemblies and of moving paddles that impel the particulates in enclosed channels. Selected materials have been assessed for this type of service under reciprocating sliding <b>abrasion</b> contact <b>conditions</b> using an adapted Cameron-Plint TE 77 wear rig at 20 0 C and 350 0 C. These include the current carburised low alloy steel, other steels, Cr white irons and Co-based alloys in bulk, overlay and surface treated forms. Examination of wear scars, using scanning electron microscopy, identified the main wear mechanisms affecting the highly resistant powder metallurgical (PM) tool steels and HVOF coating as micro-scratching and as indentation leading to micro-fracture. Materials with lowest resistance displayed evidence of significant material removal by micro-ploughing. The formation of oxide layers on some samples during testing appeared to be beneficial.

40|$|This paper covers {{research}} into the abrasion response of two hard coatings, CVD diamond and CVD boron carbide (B 13 C 2 phase), studied under a range of micro-abrasion test conditions to evaluate those which result in uniform and symmetric (i. e. non-ridged or ribboned) wear scars generated by uniform three-body rolling abrasion. Rotating steel balls on CVD boron carbide and tungsten carbide balls on CVD diamond were loaded {{in the presence of}} 4. 5 – 6. 0 ?m SiC abrasive slurry with varying solid concentrations of 0. 35 – 0. 7 g/ml (vol. fraction: 0. 112 – 0. 24). The applied normal loads were between 0. 25 and 2. 0 N with sliding speeds between 30 and 150 rpm (0. 04 – 0. 2 m/s). The optimum conditions to obtain uniform three-body rolling abrasion for both coatings was established to be at 0. 3 N normal load, 75 rpm (0. 1 m/s) ball rotation speed and at a SiC slurry concentration of 0. 5 g/ml. Under the optimum test <b>condition,</b> <b>abrasion</b> in both CVD coatings occurs predominantly through brittle micro-chipping of the CVD grains resulting in near perfect hemispherical wear scars. Significant grooving and scratch marks are observed at higher loads and ball rotation speeds which suggests a transition to sliding <b>abrasion</b> under these <b>conditions</b> caused by the abrasive and/or wear debris becoming embedded in the ball. This results in an uneven wear pattern across the scar. Sites of complete coating removal from the substrate are also observed coinciding with higher abrasion rates. Profilometry revealed a 5 – 10 % error in the evaluating the wear scar volume from optical measurements. The results show that the steady state specific wear rate of CVD diamond coatings (2 – 3 × 10 ? 14 m 3 N? 1 m? 1) is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of CVD boron carbide (6 – 7 × 10 ? 13 m 3 N? 1 m? 1) ...|$|R

Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron-Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water-oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e. g. 2 ̆ 23 c 10 - 30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of certain {{abrasion}} procedures upon specific physical properties of a high wet modulus rayon. The type of abrasion applied included surface abrasion in dry and wet <b>condition,</b> edge <b>abrasion</b> in dry <b>condition,</b> and flexing <b>abrasion</b> in dry <b>condition.</b> Dry flexing <b>abrasion</b> was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other abrasion procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, weight of fabric and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate abrasion damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the percentage losses in physical properties or (2) between period of abrasion and the percentage losses in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the percentage losses in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage of the fabric, yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of abrasion. The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the percentage losses in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of abrasion. Some abrasion procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater percentage losses in breaking load and weight of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion than to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in elongation.

EHC coatings are very tough, in fact no cracks could be produced with 10 N Vickers microindentations. However, their superficial morphology and Vickers microhardness are significantly affected by the substrate preparation technique, the deposition process characteristics, and by post-deposition treatments. This causes the coatings to show different behaviors in different wear conditions; in particular, harder coatings are more abrasion-resistant, but undergo a more severe mass loss under unlubricated sliding conditions. HVOF-sprayed cermet coatings are harder but less tough than EHC ones. Therefore, they undergo a comparable or even higher mass loss when subjected to three-body <b>abrasion</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, their two-body sliding resistance definitely overcomes that of EHC coatings, because they form a tough and uniform surface film protecting them from further damage...|$|E

Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: Wear resistant plates can be used for elements working in intensive <b>abrasion</b> resistance <b>conditions</b> to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is wear plate and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Root weld must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with wear resistant plate material. Applying welding parameters described in the paper is possible to achieve free of cracks root, presence of crack in face weld is not important in term of wear resistance abilities of chute.

Accordingly this project was undertaken to attempt to improve the {{abrasion resistance}} {{in order to maintain the}} quality image associated with wool fabrics and improve their market competitiveness vis-ä-vis other fabrics. Although several workers have discussed the effects of particular finishes on specific fabrics, very little systematic investigation of the effects of chemical treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics has been carried out. In the current study the difference in abrasion rates of woven wool fabrics composed of different structures have been studied in relation to the abrasion resistance and other relevant physical properties. The work carried out in this thesis is divided into two parts. A review of the literature is followed by a description of the experimental work carried out. The review of the literature summarises current views on the general mechanisms and factors involved in abrasion processes for textile fabrics and the effects of selective finishing treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics. In addition details of the <b>abrasion</b> testing <b>conditions</b> used in this work for determining fabric abrasion resistance have been described.

Abrasion test’s results for pipes were compared with results of standard abrasion test (Taber method) and hardness test. Design/methodology/approach: Short cuts of pipe were subjected to erosion caused by erodent, usually a mixture of special kind of sand and water. The changes of pipe’s wall thickness was a measure of resistance to erosion. Additionally abrasion resistance was measured using Taber method and ball-hardness was measured using Brinell apparatus. Findings: Calcium carbonate filled polypropylene exhibited lower resistance to abrasion than hard poly(vinyl chloride). Probably it is the result of filler presence in polypropylene. No correlation between hardness and abrasion resistance was found. Research limitations/implications: Applied method may be used to compare different pipe’s materials but its results may not be applied to other plastics products and to other <b>abrasion</b> <b>conditions.</b> Practical implications: Abrasion test used in the research may be applied to compare different materials and different pipelines components. Achieved results showed that calcium carbonate without surface preparation decrease abrasion resistance of polypropylene. Originality/value: Applied method is rarely used for polymer materials testing. Results of presented research may be interesting for pipe manufactures and polymer pipe’s formulations producers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{suitable}} chemical composition of a iron alloy with improved wear resistance. A unique set of alloys with a specifically designated chemical composition was manufactured for experiments. Their properties in defined abrasive conditions was studied in laboratory conditions. Wear resistance was determined on an experimental bench with bound particles. Material properties description was always complemented with information gained during material metallographic structure investigations. All {{the results were}} compared with results achieved for commercially available weld deposition materials (specifically designated for <b>abrasion</b> <b>conditions).</b> These (weld deposition) materials were subjected to an identical set of laboratory experiments and additionally to a set of experiments under inservice conditions. This thesis offers new knowledge {{about the relationship between}} material hardness, material structure and wear resistance. The outlined results also give evidence about the correlation between results gained under laboratory conditions and those gained under in-service conditions (in relation to material structure and hardness). At the end of the thesis the knowledge gained from these experiments is applied to a specific application the service life extension of plough blade segments. On this basis a new material is designed which will extend service life without additional demands on the costs, and the approach to the renovation of worn plough blade segments is justified...|$|E
40|$|WC-FeCrAl {{coatings}} deposited by High Velocity Air-Fuel (HVAF) spraying and by High Velocity Oxygen-Fuel (HVOF) spraying with a liquid-fuelled and a gas-fuelled torch {{were studied}} and {{compared to a}} conventional HVOF-sprayed WC-CoCr coating. During HVOF spraying, WC-FeCrAl {{had a tendency to}} oxidise and decarburise. The gas-fuelled torch, operated with excess fuel, could restrain these phenomena, compared to the liquid fuelled one. In the HVAF coating, oxidation and decarburisation were further reduced, but porosity was >. 1 %. As a consequence, the HVAF-sprayed coating was less hard than the HVOF-sprayed ones. Of all the WC-FeCrAl coatings, the gas fuelled-HVOF sprayed one exhibited the best wear resistance both in dry sliding conditions (at room temperature as well as at 400 °C) and in dry particle abrasion testing. It indeed achieves the best compromise between density, hardness and low oxidation, so that it can reduce the extent of the brittle cracking phenomena affecting all WC-FeCrAl samples. Its dry sliding wear rate of ≈ 3 * 10 - 8 mm 3 /(Nm) at room temperature is even slightly lower than that of the WC-CoCr reference. Its performance under high temperature sliding and dry particle <b>abrasion</b> <b>conditions</b> is, however, somewhat poorer than that of the reference...|$|E
40|$|Current {{guidelines}} {{with respect}} to the use of irrigation intakes limit Canadian operatorsto approach velocities (at the screen) of 3. 8 cm/s; however, this value is based on relatively littledata. To address this issue, I examined the ability of juvenile (2. 3 – 7. 4 -cm fork length) northernpike (Esox lucius) to avoid impingement on irrigation intake screens under ambient environmentalconditions in a swim tunnel (where water velocity was constant and uniform) and in a simulatedintake where water velocity declined with distance from the test screen (as in real structures). Theeffects of impingement duration (in swim tunnel tests) and approach velocity (in both tests) onfeeding and physical <b>condition</b> (<b>abrasions,</b> bruising, and scale loss) were also examined. Juvenilenorthern pike in the swim tunnel became impinged at speeds ranging from 10 to 28 cm/s. Injuriesand mortalities from impingement up to 10 min in duration were nonexistent, although someshort-term feeding disruptions were observed. Northern pike tested in the intake simulationapparatus never became impinged when the approach velocity was 15 cm/s; however, someimpingement (but no feeding disruptions, injuries, or mortalities) was observed at an approachvelocity of 25 cm/s. At higher velocities, impingement, feeding disruptions, injuries, and mortalitiesoccurred. Environmental regulations pertaining to approach velocity at irrigation intake screenscan be set as high as 15 cm/s without adversely affecting juvenile northern pike...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Development {{of a new}} {{generation}} tool materials on the basis of M 2 high speed-steel or 41 Cr 4 steel covered with the carbides. Application of pressureless forming of powder as a manufacturing method of anti-wear coatings gives the possibility to produce this materials with relative low cost of production. Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, pressureless forming of powder, sintering, microstructure examination, X-ray dispersive energy examination, hardness examination. Findings: Putting down coatings with this method does not call for using the costly equipment for the physical or chemical deposition of coatings from the gaseous phase. Coating thickness may be easily regulated by applying the powder-binder slurry layer once or several times on the prepared substrate surface. Hardness of coatings in the sintered state is higher compared to the HS 6 - 5 - 2 and 41 Cr 4 steels by about 400 and 700 HV respectively. It is expected that hardness of the coatings and substrate will grow after their heat treatment. Practical implications: Application of powder metallurgy and especially pressureless forming of powder to manufacturing of steel covered with anti-wear coatings gives the possibility to obtain tool materials with the relative high ductility characteristic of steel and high hardness and wear resistance typical for cemented carbides. Originality/value: One can state, based on the investigations carried out, that the pressureless forming of the powder may be used for depositing the anti-wear coatings onto the tool materials and other elements in the <b>abrasion</b> wear service <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} systems are {{expected}} to be sited in desert locations where the direct normal irradiation is above 1800 kWh/m 2. year. These systems include large solar collector assemblies, which account for a significant share of the investment cost. Solarreflectors are the main components of these solar collector assemblies and dust/sand storms may affect their reflectance properties, either by soiling or by surface abrasion. While soiling can be reverted by cleaning, surface abrasion is a non reversible degradation. The aim of this project was to study the accelerated aging of second surface silvered thickglass solar reflectors under simulated sandstorm conditions and develop a multi-parametric model which relates the specular reflectance loss to dust/sand storm parameters: wind velocity, dust concentration and time of exposure. This project focused on the degradation caused by surface <b>abrasion.</b> Sandstorm <b>conditions</b> were simulated in a prototype environmental test chamber. Material samples (6 cm x 6 cm) were exposed to Arizona coarse test dust. The dust stream impactedthese material samples at a perpendicular angle. Both wind velocity and dust concentrationwere maintained at a stable level for each accelerated aging test. The total exposure time in the test chamber was limited to 1 hour. Each accelerated aging test was interrupted every 4 minutes to measure the specular reflectance of the material sample after cleaning. The accelerated aging test campaign had to be aborted prematurely due to a contamination of the dust concentration sensor. A robust multi-parametric degradation model could thus not be derived. The experimental data showed that the specular reflectance loss decreasedeither linearly or exponentially with exposure time, so that a degradation rate could be defined as a single modeling parameter. A correlation should be derived to relate this degradation rate to control parameters such as wind velocity and dust/sand concentration. The sandstorm chamber design would have to be updated before performing further accelerated aging test campaigns. The design upgrade should improve both the reliability of the test equipment and the repeatability of accelerated aging tests. An outdoor exposure test campaign should be launched in deserts {{to learn more about the}} intensity, frequencyand duration of dust/sand storms. This campaign would also serve to correlate the results of outdoor exposure tests with accelerated exposure tests in order to develop a robust service lifetime prediction model for different types of solar reflector materials...|$|R
