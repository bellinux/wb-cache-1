5|$|In {{part because}} he was {{overlooked}} until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained {{in a series of}} private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It {{does not appear to have}} been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> on occasion throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{removing}} the gubernatorial term limit was first {{proposed in the}} 1850 constitutional convention, but was vigorously opposed {{by some of the}} state's best known statesmen of the day, including Archibald Dixon, Garrett Davis, Benjamin Hardin, and Charles A. Wickliffe. Not until 1992 was an amendment to the state constitution passed to help ameliorate the situation by making the governor eligible to succeed himself one time before becoming ineligible for four years. Succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during the administrations of John Y. Brown, Jr. and Wallace Wilkinson, but then-Governor Brereton Jones was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> passed because, unlike Brown and Wilkinson, he was willing to exempt the present incumbents, including himself, from the succession provision. Paul E. Patton, with victories in the elections of 1995 and 1999, was the first governor to be elected to consecutive terms since the 1992 amendment. Another constitutional amendment, passed in November 2000, called for a 30-day legislative session to be held in odd-numbered years between the longer 60-day sessions held in even-numbered years.|$|E

25|$|Henry rejects materialism, which admits only {{matter as}} reality, because {{the manifestation of}} matter in the {{transcendence}} of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation.

25|$|Vette's DC-10 was not {{carrying}} any instruments designed for search and rescue, {{so the two}} pilots were forced to get creative. The captain could roughly estimate Prochnow's position relative to his plane by comparing their relative headings when facing the sun and solar angles of elevation. Next, Vette began to triangulate the Cessna's location using the 200-mile range of its VHF radio. Vette also tried dumping 24,000 pounds of fuel from his own aircraft {{in the hope that}} Prochnow might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> but this proved to be unsuccessful. Prochnow and Vette then compared the time at which each of them observed the sun to set, and the addition of this new information finally made it possible for the Cessna's position to be calculated. After 23 hours of flying, and almost out of fuel—having used cruise control to stretch out the Cessna's usual 22 hours of fuel—Prochnow landed safely at Norfolk Island.|$|E

However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found [...] "dangerous to the prestige [...] " [...] considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in Panorama, criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset– something that never happened.|$|E

500|$|Jones also {{advocated}} for {{an amendment to}} the state constitution that had major implications for the governor's office. Under the terms of the amendment, the lieutenant governor no longer became acting governor when the sitting governor left the state. It also allowed candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a ticket instead of being elected on separate ballots. The centerpiece of the amendment, however, was the removal of the restriction on governors from succeeding themselves in office. The state constitution had previously barred the incumbent from seeking a second consecutive term; under the new amendment, the sitting governor would be allowed to succeed himself once. Succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during the administrations of John Y. Brown, Jr. and Wallace Wilkinson, but Jones was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> passed because, unlike Brown and Wilkinson, he was willing to exempt the present incumbents, including himself, from the succession provision.

2500|$|Studies of the {{mammalian}} brain {{have discovered}} that the excess of cerebral neurons is a phenomenon of mainly animals which had to seek and capture food. [...] These neurons have become {{a large part of}} the olfactory system throughout evolution to allow higher mammals such as primates to have a better chance for survival through more advanced methods of hunting and finding food. For example, the vulture has a large part of its brain committed to olfactory senses. This allows for it to be able to detect food at long ranges without being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Having memory for various types of food aids in survival by allowing the animals to remember which scent is edible and which is not.|$|E

Burton described it as [...] "the mirror of all wickedness and idolatry" [...] to the Europeans, an introduction of Hinduism as [...] "monstrous paganism" [...] to early travellers to the Indian subcontinent. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier never saw the Puri temple icon and its decorations, but described the jewelry worn by the idol from hearsay accounts.

2500|$|On December 8, 1947, 12-year-old , {{her sister}} Jeannette, and cousin Nicole Robin were among {{students}} in L'Île-Bouchard in France whose teacher {{asked them to}} spend the lunch hour [...] "praying for France". Although their families were nonpracticing and anticlerical, the girls agreed to their teacher's request; this {{was a period of}} intense civil strife in France and many believed civil war was imminent. The girls were saying the Rosary in the church of St. Gilles when they experienced the first of several Marian apparitions. They said they saw a beautiful young lady with long curly blonde hair, accompanied by an angel (whom they later identified as Gabriel) who knelt at her side. Running out into the street, the girls asked two friends to come and see the vision: one, Laura Croizon, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> and became the fourth visionary. The day after the first apparition, labor unions agreed to go into negotiations with the government, and believers credited the apparition and the children's prayers. The visitations went on for six days. They were approved on December 8, 2001, by André Vingt-Trois, then Archbishop of Tours, who authorized pilgrimage and public worship celebrated in L'Île-Bouchard in honor of [...] "Our Lady of Prayer", after a diocesan investigation lasting eighteen months.|$|E

2500|$|CP/M 2.2 had no sub-directories in {{the file}} structure, but {{provided}} 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type [...] "User X" [...] at the command prompt, X being {{the number of the}} user wanted; security was non-existent and not believed to be necessary. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory path, since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with hard drives. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do data entry, then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do billing without their files intermixing.|$|E
2500|$|While the German Police {{expressed}} {{satisfaction in}} their ability to contain and deal with hooliganism, speculation was rife that a number of potential flashpoints existed which could cause widespread public disorder. With a number of routes into the country, amongst them the open land borders which are a consequence of the Schengen agreement, apprehension of known troublemakers and organisers of disturbances looked to be a very real problem. However, during the World Cup, Germany suspended its rules granting passport-free travel to EU citizens. As an illustration of this, on 8 June, German police apprehended 9 English hooligans attempting to enter the country via the Czech border. Britain has a particularly stringent policy of restricting foreign travel of known football hooligans during periods where the England team are involved. 3,500 banning orders were served, and by 8 June all but 150 had surrendered their passports. On 9 June Channel 4 News in the UK reported that although there had been no violence, England fans in Frankfurt had been kicking footballs at the windows of the city's 600-year-old Römer city hall building, although local police decided not to take action over this minor incident and the staff at the Mayor's office apparently took the attempted vandalism in good humour. On the day of England's first match against Paraguay two England fans were arrested for having swastikas and SS insignia painted on their bodies. The two were flown back to England to appear in court; one was found guilty and banned from attending football matches until 2008, while the other was not banned as the symbol (the double-sig rune of the SS) was painted on his back, and he may not have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> or known what it was. [...] The court heard that the fan found guilty also had a letter J on his arm, believed to be a slight to Jews, but claimed not to know its meaning.|$|E
2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what you might see from something that was searingly hot traveling through the air, like a disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
