5|$|Aston Villa have {{a unique}} {{relationship}} with the <b>Acorns</b> Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated {{the front of the}} shirt on their kit, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to <b>Acorns</b> Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and greater fund raising capabilities. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club have paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} do plant a few <b>acorns,</b> and I have lived to see one or two trees growing: gay rights, freedom of information, CND. I'm not {{claiming}} them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, <b>acorns,</b> lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} their diets with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E

Meanwhile, <b>Acorn</b> 1 was completely demolished and small community of two-story single-family houses between Filbert and Market Streets were built in its place.|$|R
5|$|The Ignudi are the 20 athletic, nude males that Michelangelo painted as {{supporting}} figures at {{each corner}} of the five smaller narrative scenes that run along {{the centre of the}} ceiling. The figures hold or are draped with or lean on a variety of items which include pink ribbons, green bolsters and enormous garlands of <b>acorns.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and <b>acorns</b> of oak trees, such as Coast Live Oak, Valley Oak and Black Oak. It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to early winter.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering <b>acorns</b> and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>acorn</b> nuts. One is low, or the {{standard}} <b>acorn</b> nut. The other is the high <b>acorn</b> nut. The high <b>acorn</b> nut is wider and higher and will protect extra long studs. There are also self-locking <b>acorn</b> nuts that have distorted threads in the hex area to create a tight friction fit to prevent the nut from vibrating loose.|$|R
50|$|A {{common problem}} among Korean-manufactured {{products}} {{is that their}} ingredient labels are often not properly translated. <b>Acorn</b> starch is frequently mislabeled as <b>acorn</b> flour or <b>acorn</b> powder. In reality, <b>acorn</b> starch is essentially highly refined <b>acorn</b> flour, devoid of fiber, fat, and almost all nutrition. While the <b>acorn</b> itself does indeed contain <b>acorn</b> starch, that starch is not highly refined. <b>Acorn</b> starch, in contrast, is extracted from the meat of the kernel using a wet process and then dehydrated. The heart, or germ, of the kernel is removed and used for producing <b>acorn</b> oil, which is comparable in flavor and quality to olive oil. The hull is separated from the kernel meat, and the starch is extracted from the kernel meat. It might be more accurate {{to use the term}} “acorn meal”, although a meal is a coarser, less refined version of flour.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{may have}} visited the Yosemite area {{as long as}} 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. By the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3,000 years ago, {{vegetation}} and game in the region {{was similar to that}} present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had <b>acorns,</b> deer, and salmon, while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid.|$|E
5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. It is a common and {{abundant}} species in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the fallen leaves and <b>acorns</b> of various oak species. First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, {{the group}} {{stumbled}} into a Miwok camp looking so deteriorated that the camp's inhabitants initially fled. The Miwoks gave {{them what they}} had to eat: <b>acorns,</b> grass, and pine nuts. After a few days, Eddy continued on {{with the help of a}} Miwok to a ranch in a small farming community at the edge of the Sacramento Valley. A hurriedly assembled rescue party found the other six survivors on January 17. Their journey from Truckee Lake had taken 33days.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acorn</b> Arcade {{was founded}} in 1997 by Alasdair Bailey and Graham Crockford.

50|$|An <b>acorn</b> tube, or <b>acorn</b> valve, {{refers to}} {{any member of}} a family of VHF/UHF vacuum tubes {{starting}} just before World War II. They were named after their resemblance to the <b>acorn,</b> specifically due to the glass cap {{at one end of the}} tube that looked similar to the cap on an <b>acorn.</b> The <b>acorn</b> tubes found widespread use in radios and radar systems.|$|R
2500|$|<b>ACORN</b> {{supported}} education reform, {{usually in}} the form of organizing neighborhood groups and [...] "community" [...] or [...] "ACORN schools". In Chicago, <b>ACORN</b> has advocated for a certified teacher to be in every classroom. In California, <b>ACORN</b> has documented the need for textbooks and school repairs. <b>ACORN</b> works with teachers unions to gain funding for school construction and more funding for schools. <b>ACORN</b> also supports school reform and the [...] "creation of alternative public schools" [...] such as charter schools. <b>ACORN</b> opposed the privatization of some NYC schools, favoring its own Charter School plan. The <b>ACORN</b> model for schools emphasizes small classes, parent involvement, qualified teachers and [...] "community-oriented curricula".|$|R
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and <b>acorns,</b> tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E
5|$|The Foundation's commitment, {{along with}} a similar {{foundation}} run by West Bromwich Albion, the unique relationship that Aston Villa has with <b>Acorns</b> Children's Hospice and Tottenham Hotspur has with SOS Children's Villages UK, are some leading examples of commitment in {{the highest level of}} football to responsibility and change in the communities in which they work and who enrich them through their support and ticket sales. The work of these clubs, and others, is changing the way professional sport interacts with their communities and supporters.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even <b>acorns.</b> The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000years, based on the age of Clovis points that were {{discovered}} nearby. The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as <b>acorns</b> and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was by mountain man James Clyman in 1845.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, <b>acorns</b> or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do <b>acorns</b> and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of <b>acorns</b> when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including <b>acorns,</b> American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|The Acjachemem, who {{numbered}} roughly 2000 overall, were hunter-gatherers, {{living in}} small, semi-permanent villages close to water sources. There were five villages {{on the main}} stem of San Juan Creek, three of which were below the Trabuco Creek confluence, and four more {{in other parts of}} the watershed, mostly on Trabuco and Oso Creeks. The Acjachemem diet usually consisted of fruits, <b>acorns,</b> grains, and some meat, while they practiced little agriculture. Shell middens indicate that they also harvested shellfish from the coast. Native peoples in this area are not known to have built permanent structures in this area or significantly influenced the natural environment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Acorn</b> {{is home to}} the <b>Acorn</b> street gang. [...] Due {{to close}} proximity, skirmishes between <b>Acorn</b> and {{neighboring}} Cypress Village as well as Lower Bottoms occur frequently. In order to reduce the violence between the two housing projects, in 2003 local rappers from both <b>Acorn</b> and Cypress released an underground mixtape titled <b>Acorn</b> & Cypress inspired by other unity rap albums like the Bloods and Crips Bangin' on Wax releases. Since then, West Oakland based rap label Livewire Records founded by J Stalin (who originates from Cypress Village) has signed numerous rappers from both housing units, including <b>Acorn</b> native Shady Nate.|$|R
