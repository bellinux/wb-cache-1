The hire rate was £84.6.0d per month– approximately £2,500. In 1943, she was sold to Mrs E D Breen of Edinburgh, though she remained in use by the Admiralty. In June 1945, {{after the end of}} the war in Europe, she was sold to Grimsby Merchants Amalgamated Fishing Co Ltd and gained pennant number GY57 but remained under military command.

5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, Brant and her {{children}} left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British officials and the Iroquois. After the war, she settled {{in what is now}} Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave Brant a pension and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former colonial territory to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti-aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 {{to the end of}} the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. Amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija was captured by the Italians after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, renamed Cattaro, and pressed into service with the Italian Navy. She was then captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in September 1943, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> original name, Niobe. The ship ran aground in the Adriatic in December 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of British Motor Torpedo Boats. Niobe, Medusa, and Arcona were broken up for scrap in the late 1940s, but Amazone lingered on as a barracks ship until 1954, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E

5|$|While {{traveling}} in Mexico, Scripps met María Pilar Arellanos, of Cancún, and married her in 1980. They travelled together {{for two years}} until 1982, when {{he was sentenced to}} a three-year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset María, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during home leave in June 1985—just months short of completing his term—and burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on home leave. He was appeased only when she divorced her new husband <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to John Martin.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E
5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to {{climbing}} at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.|$|E
