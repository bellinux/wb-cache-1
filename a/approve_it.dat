5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to <b>approve</b> <b>it</b> in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E

5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler {{had the power to}} void Robinson's contract, but he chose to <b>approve</b> <b>it.</b> Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E

Atangana was chosen for this position among the Ewondo and Bane either before his trip to Germany or soon after. This was technically only a temporary appointment; his subjects would have to <b>approve</b> <b>it</b> a year later to make it permanent. They had little alternative; Atangana was already the primary conduit of information {{to and from the}} Germans.|$|E

The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over.
