25|$|Test runs {{started on}} 10 January 1894. The {{official}} {{opening of the}} first Nordic electric tramway took place on 2 March 1894 and ordinary operation commenced the following day. It was the seventh electric tramway to open in Europe. Amongst the concerns in the public debate was that horses, such as those from the competing KSS, {{would not be able}} to cope with seeing a tram running without being pulled by a horse. The competitor's labor union proposed that KES used stuffed horses in front of their trams, but the horses soon learned to cope with the <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicle.</b> At first the trams ran every six minutes, but this proved difficult to operate and it was reduced to an eight-minute headway.|$|E

40|$|This review {{draws on}} {{literature}} {{relating to the}} interactions of vehicles with other vehicles, interactions between vehicles and infrastructure, and interactions between <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and cyclists and <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and pedestrians. The available literature relating to <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> interactions is currently limited and hence the review has considered issues which will be relevant to <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> from reading and evaluating a broader but still relevant literature. The project is concerned primarily with <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> within the urban environment and hence the greatest consideration {{has been given to}} interactions on typical urban roads, with specific consideration also being given to shared space. The central questions in relation to <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and other road users revolve around gap acceptance, overtaking behaviour, behaviour at road narrowings, the ability to detect and avoid cyclists taking paths through a junction which conflict with the <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicleâ€™s</b> path, and the ability of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> to sense and respond to human gestures. A long list of potential research questions has been developed, many of which are not realistically answerable by the Venturer project. However, the important research questions which might potentially be answered by the current project are offered {{as the basis for the}} more detailed consideration of the conduct of the interaction trial...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{scientific}} and policy analysis of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> advocates their safety and accessibility. This dissertation seeks to contribute to broadening academic discourse by examining the energy efficiency opportunities of the introduction of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and vehicle communication technology. As the global market for <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> develops, the impacts on society are beginning to be investigated including the impact on energy efficiency. This dissertation will contribute to this discourse by examining platooning and automated intersection management as techniques for improving efficiency {{as a result of}} the introduction of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, this dissertation will analyse how society is likely to adapt to <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> being introduced into the market and the how it may impact the energy efficiency of transportation networks.

40|$|The {{technology}} of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{is expected to}} revolutionize the operation of road transport systems. The penetration rate of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> will be low at the early stage of their deployment. It {{is a challenge to}} explore the effects of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their penetration on heterogeneous traffic flow dynamics. This paper aims to investigate this issue. An improved cellular automaton was employed as the modeling platform for our study. In particular, two sets of rules for lane changing were designed to address mild and aggressive lane changing behavior. With extensive simulation studies, we obtained some promising results. First, the introduction of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> to road traffic could considerably improve traffic flow, particularly the road capacity and free-flow speed. And the level of improvement increases with the penetration rate. Second, the lane-changing frequency between neighboring lanes evolves with traffic density along a fundamental-diagram-like curve. Third, the impacts of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the collective traffic flow characteristics are mainly related to their smart maneuvers in lane changing and car following, and it seems that the car-following impact is more pronounced...|$|R

The redesigned, multiple-cars-per-shaft, multilevel-boarding ride system for the California version of the tower required that one elevator load while another be in the drop shaft progressing through the ride cycle.

2500|$|The course {{involved}} a [...] urban area course, {{to be completed}} in less than 6 hours. [...] Rules [...] included obeying all traffic regulations while negotiating with other traffic and obstacles and merging into traffic. [...] While the 2004 and 2005 events were more physically challenging for the vehicles, the robots operated in isolation and did not encounter other vehicles on the course, the Urban Challenge required designers to build vehicles able to obey all traffic laws while they detect and avoid other vehicles on the course. [...] Both other competing robots and human professional drivers occupied the course. This is a particular challenge for vehicle software, as vehicles must make [...] "intelligent" [...] decisions in real time based on the actions of other vehicles. Other than previous <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicle</b> efforts that focused on structured situations such as highway driving with little interaction between the vehicles, this competition operated in a more cluttered urban environment and required the cars to perform sophisticated interactions with each other, such as maintaining precedence at a 4-way stop intersection.|$|E

First, the motivations and applications of using vision based target tracking for <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> navigation are presented in the introduction section. It can be concluded that it is very necessary to develop robust visual target tracking based navigation algorithms for the broad applications of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Then this paper reviews the recent techniques in three different categories: vision based target tracking for the applications of land, underwater and aerial vehicles navigation. Next, the increasing trends of using data fusion for visual target tracking based <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> navigation are discussed. Through data fusion the tracking performance is improved and becomes more robust. Based on the review, the remaining research challenges are summarized and future research directions are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, many studies have {{provided}} detailed descriptions of the potential benefits associated {{with the introduction of}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as improvements in traffic flows, local and global emissions, traffic safety, cost efficiency of public and private transport operations, etc. Additionally, the mobilization of mobility impaired people and the independent car use of travelers without driverâ€™s license has been identified as a potential benefit for users. However, only estimating the benefits of these direct (or first-order) effects is unlikely to show the full picture of consequences that will emerge once <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> enter the roads. In this paper, we therefore put emphasis on discussing systemic (or second-order) effects. We show that these effects â€“ especially in urban areas and without adequate policy intervention â€“ have the potential to eliminate {{at least some of the}} benefits initially associated with <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Following this systemic view on <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles,</b> we finally discuss policy aspects for responsible authorities and planners on how to prepare transportation systems for the challenges related to the introduction of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vehicles</b> and conclude with areas of research that seem highly important to be investigated further in this context...|$|R
