5|$|In cricket, {{the captain}} is <b>a</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> {{leads the team}} and has {{additional}} roles and responsibilities. The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket tournament organised by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). Its first edition occurred in 2012.

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E
5|$|Set {{within a}} fictionalized {{version of the}} San Francisco Bay Area, {{the game is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle.

50|$|In game theory, a two-player {{deterministic}} perfect-information turn-based game is first-player-win if <b>a</b> perfect <b>player</b> <b>who</b> plays first {{can always}} force a win.Similarly, a game is second-player-win if <b>a</b> perfect <b>player</b> <b>who</b> plays second can always force a win.When winning {{is not possible}} with perfect play by both opposing sides, the game is a draw.|$|R
