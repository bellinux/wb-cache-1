5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba goes to an udon shop {{without her}} father's knowledge, and {{is allowed to}} watch udon being made. After getting a pizza menu in the mail, the Koiwais order a couple, though one {{turns out to be}} too much for Yotsuba to hold. After an {{announcement}} of an upcoming camping trip, Yanda arrives with various bubble-blowing devices, which they play inside, then outside, with. Yotsuba, Fuka, and Fuka's classmate from chapter 45 go to a shrine to pick chestnuts, and Yotsuba learns about burr covers and bug infestations. Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses to go around taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> it, making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E

25|$|African wolves {{frequently}} groom one another, {{particularly during}} courtship, during {{which it can}} last up to Â½ hour. Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its canine teeth like a dog.|$|E
25|$|Dishes {{based on}} {{soybeans}} are {{a staple of}} vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often {{in the form of}} soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm, and extra firm for stews and stir-fries; to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts, <b>and</b> <b>shakes.</b> Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.|$|E

25|$|Although {{parthenogenetic}} species do occur, most harvestmen reproduce sexually. Mating involves direct copulation, {{rather than}} the deposition of a spermatophore. The males of some species offer a secretion (nuptial gift) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation. Sometimes, the male guards the female after copulation, and in many species, the males defend territories. In some species, males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> the female's sensory leg. This is believed to entice the female into mating a second time. The females lay eggs from an ovipositor shortly after mating to several months later. Some species build nests for this purpose. A unique feature of harvestmen is that in some species, the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners, often against egg-eating females, and subjecting the eggs to regular cleaning. Depending on circumstances such as temperature, the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days, up to about half a year after being laid. Harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity, with most known species having six instars.|$|E

500|$|The player-character, {{a robotic}} maid named Marina, {{journeys}} {{to save her}} kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world {{on the cusp of}} civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating [...] "Clanball" [...] platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Indeed, almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake [...] "grabbed" [...] objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player health. The health gauge {{in the corner of the}} screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two additional stock lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight cardinal and ordinal directions. She can also slide, hover, and roll.|$|E

500|$|On November 16, 2004 Destiny's Child {{performed}} [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{during the}} television show Good Morning America broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The song was performed on June 28 during the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles. Midway through the performance, for which the members wore form-fitting, floor-length brown gowns, they randomly picked Terrence Howard, Nelly and Magic Johnson from the audience to the stage and performed a lap dance for them. Corey Moss of MTV News felt that their performance {{was one of the}} more memorable of the night. Emily Tan from the website Idolator noted that the performance was one of the band's best further writing, [...] "No one expected the girls to get as down and dirty as they did... But it looked like no one was complaining." [...] Steve Baltin writing for Rolling Stone remarked that the group provided [...] "some sizzle". The trio gave a live rendition of [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] again at NBC's The Today Show show on July 29, 2005. A writer of People magazine felt that [...] "BeyoncÃ© shimmies <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> things up" [...] during the performance. An acoustic version was also performed on MTV in 2005 during the its Spring Break coverage.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished <b>and</b> <b>Shakes</b> versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's playsâlike all theatreâfrom an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw helps us {{to get away from the}} Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera is well {{respected}} throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "I {{look up to}} how he's handled himself {{on and off the}} field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> [...] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{there can}} be similar rites of {{passages}} associated with parts of naval and military life, which do not constitute true initiations as the participants are already and remain {{members of the same}} community. One such rite is associated with crossing the equator on board a naval ship, but it can even be taken by passengers on board a cruise liner, who are not and do not become members of anything but the so-called [...] "equator crossing club". Another form, âKissing the Royal Bellyâ or âRoyal Babyâ, calls for initiates to kneel before {{a senior member of the}} crew, who wears a mock diaper. This âBabyâ usually has a huge stomach covered with greasy materials ranging from cooking oil to mustard, shaving cream, eggs, and oysters. Junior sailors must lick the Babyâs navel area, while the [...] "baby" [...] grabs <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> their head to better smear the goo onto their faces.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{reason for}} the lack of serious search and salvage efforts {{is the fact that the}} Chagas' cargo was mainly loose gems which, upon the ship exploding, would have flown everywhere, before {{cascading}} down through approximately one mile of water and then settling into phytodetritic ooze, which is itself in the long and slow process of sliding down a mountain (Faial Island). This process has been aggravated by very devastating earthquakes which struck Faial in 1672, 1760, and particularly in 1926, a violent and prolonged underwater event at Pico in 1963 and a powerful event under both Pico and Faial in 1973 which had numerous aftershocks. Each of these events shuffles <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> the entire region, triggering large and powerful submarine landslides, so that the remains of the Chagas and its cargo would slide further down the mountain and deeper under the mud. It would appear unlikely in the extreme that gemstones only millimeters across, small artifacts of interest or value or even the ship's large pieces of ordinance would presently remain at the surface of the sediment, and consequently, despite the fabulous wealth of the ship, the values of recovered treasures may not (...) exceed the expense of salvaging them.|$|E
