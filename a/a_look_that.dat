25|$|To {{coincide}} with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team introduced pullover spandex uniforms, the first such team in baseball, and <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> would quickly be adopted by most other teams {{by the end of}} the decade. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.|$|E

After spotting a girl on a Sheffield bus with a Veronica Lake hairstyle, Oakey was inspired to adopt a strange lopsided geometric hairstyle, shoulder length {{on one side and}} short on the other. Between 1978–1979 with his unique hairstyle, he maintained a masculine dress style and at one time wore a full beard.|$|E

With <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco, Grim Fandango is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer.

500|$|The film {{features}} {{a number of}} scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during {{the aftermath of the}} heist. Libatique described these scenes as a [...] "flash-forward" [...] to events, explaining that Lee [...] "wanted <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> would jump out and tell you you’re somewhere else." [...] Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 reversal film. Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, [...] "Basically, it unifies all the color...When you try to apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{attack on}} rank and {{hierarchy}} dominates the Rights of Men. She chastises Burke for his {{contempt for the}} people, whom he dismisses as the [...] "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably Marie Antoinette. In a famous passage, Burke had written: [...] "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone." [...] Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the Rights of Men into larger social and political contexts.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was shown}} second in {{broadcast}} order following the , [...] "Past Prologue" [...] was filmed third, following [...] "". There were several changes to hair and makeup following [...] "A Man Alone", including modifications to Odo, and a simpler, closer haircut for Nana Visitor {{in her role as}} Major Kira. Visitor had pushed for her changes as she did not find it believable that the character would style her hair on a daily basis, instead wanting <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> took minimal effort. The episode was directed by Winrich Kolbe, in line with executive producer Rick Berman's policy of only allowing directors with previous experience on [...] work on the [...] of Deep Space Nine. He would go on to direct the series finale of The Next Generation, [...] "", and 48 episodes of the franchise across four separate series.|$|E

A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".|$|E
500|$|The new {{schedule}} {{resulted in}} a conflict for Anthony Quinn, who was signed to play the title role in Attila, a 1954 epic, also produced by De Laurentiis and directed by Pietro Francisci. At first, Quinn considered withdrawing from La Strada, but Fellini convinced him to work on both films simultaneously, shooting La Strada {{in the morning and}} Attila in the afternoon and evening. The plan often required the actor to get up at 3:30a.m. in order to capture the [...] "bleak early light" [...] on which Fellini insisted, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampanò outfit in order to be on the set in time to be transformed into Attila the Hun for afternoon shooting. Quinn recalled: [...] "This schedule accounted for the haggard look I had in both films, <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> was perfect for Zampanò but scarcely OK for Attila the Hun." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} monarchy and hereditary privilege {{but also the}} language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections, Burke had lamented: [...] "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> threatened her [...] with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone." [...] Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was {{at the expense of}} the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language. By redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burke's readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
500|$|After reading each script, Foley {{would do}} her own research, before {{discussing}} {{the look of}} the episode with the writers. She then studies the comics, general fashion, and history to get <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series. Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging due to the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule. Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not. Marvel CCO Joe Quesada is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters, including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume that is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake [...] "could easily be part of the Avengers". Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow costumes from the films, but was [...] "flattered" [...] by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about not sexualising characters such as Quake to show that [...] "these characters don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women", and so avoided [...] "a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Square Enix {{announced}} a franchise reboot titled Tomb Raider; the new Lara Croft {{would be a}} darker, grittier reimagining of the character. In examining the character, Crystal Dynamics concluded that Croft's largest failing was her [...] "Teflon coating", and that it needed a more human version that players would care about. The studio sought a new voice actress, trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers. The second reboot focuses {{on the origin of}} the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character's biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character's appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, [...] "M-shaped" [...] lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose. The company also changed the character's wardrobe, focusing on what it believed was more functional and practical. In designing the outfits, staff aimed to create <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> was [...] "relevant" [...] and [...] "youthful", but not too [...] "trendy" [...] or [...] "hip". To gauge the redesign, Crystal Dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed the new version and previous ones.|$|E

500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

Neo_G agrees that Neo Geo games back then had <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>that</b> tried to imitate reality through pixels.
