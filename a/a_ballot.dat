During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast <b>a</b> <b>ballot.</b> Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast <b>a</b> <b>ballot.</b> The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

50|$|An {{approval}} voting ballot can {{be considered}} as <b>a</b> ratings <b>ballot</b> with two possible ratings 1 (approve) and 0 (disapprove). Under conditions of strategy (rational voters wishing to obtain the best outcome for themselves with perfect knowledge of how all other voters will vote) <b>a</b> rating <b>ballot</b> with more than 2 rating points should become identical to <b>an</b> Approval <b>ballot</b> with all candidates being given either the highest or lowest rating.|$|R

This led to the strike being declared illegal.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{who oppose}} card check argue it strips workers {{of their right}} to <b>a</b> secret <b>ballot.</b> They also argue that even though {{gathering}} a majority of card signers might imply that <b>a</b> secret <b>ballot</b> would be unnecessary, signers could be coerced to sign through intimidation and pressure; the same could also be said of employers in the period between sign-up and <b>a</b> secret <b>ballot.</b> Many business organizations, including The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, oppose the implementation of card check.

5|$|Seattle is {{a charter}} city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, {{rather than by}} {{geographic}} subdivisions.
