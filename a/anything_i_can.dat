500|$|The occupying forces {{apparently}} presumed Princess Andrew was pro-German, {{as one of}} her sons-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse, was {{a member}} of the NSDAP and the Waffen-SS, and another, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, had been invalided out of the German army in 1940 after an injury in France. Nonetheless, when visited by a German general who asked her, [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?", she replied, [...] "You can take your troops out of my country." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen {{and try to figure}} out if I have <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bring to a song." ...|$|E

500|$|Describing the {{diagnosis}} as an [...] "embuggerance" [...] {{in a radio}} interview, Pratchett appealed to people to [...] "keep things cheerful" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism." [...] He stated {{he felt he had}} time for [...] "at least a few more books yet", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask [...] "is there <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do?", in this case he would only entertain such offers from [...] "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." [...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E

500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E
2500|$|Slates {{reviewer}} {{pointed out}} that Serial is not escapist {{and went on to}} note: [...] "Someone in the show is not telling the truth about something very sinister. That's the narrative tension that makes Serial not only compelling but also unlike <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember watching or reading before." [...] The Baltimore Sun commented on the inherently riveting subject matter and noted that the top-notch reporting and podcast format yield [...] "a novel twist on the investigative long-form piece".|$|E
2500|$|Hoffman had {{previously}} sought the Republican nomination. In July, when Scozzafava was nominated instead, Hoffman {{offered to help}} her. His email to her read: [...] "Hi Dede, Congratulations {{and the best of}} luck in your candidacy. Let me know if there is <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help. Doug." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, he contacted Conservative Party leaders, seeking support for his own candidacy. One Republican leader said that Hoffman, while seeking the Republican nomination, had [...] "repeatedly" [...] pledged to support the nominee.|$|E

2500|$|Thinking it {{very likely}} that the {{universe}} may contain a few agencies—say half a million—about which no man knows <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not but suspect that {{a small proportion of}} these agencies—say five thousand—may be severally competent to the production of all the [...] phenomena, or may be quite up to the task among them. The physical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient: the spiritualist hypothesis is sufficient, but ponderously difficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first for more results of trial.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, neither of you should be in the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I think you have a huge career ahead of you and all I can say is that I'll do <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diaz {{is known}} for talking trash to his opponents during fights, competes in triathlons for {{recreation}} and uses his endurance to constantly put pressure on his opponent, as well as pushing {{the pace of the}} fight. Diaz has said, [...] "Fighters are afraid of conditioning, they are afraid of getting tired, but I don’t want to have anxiety or be afraid of <b>anything.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go 100 percent out there and {{never have to worry about}} getting tired. Everybody says fighting is 90 percent mental, and it's true. Knowing you can go 15 minutes or 25 minutes without any problem can help you sustain that mental advantage over your opponent..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court told four {{students}} to consider applying for admission {{in a year}} or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: [...] "Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. I know that you will keep on trying wherever you are. Secondly, please remember that if there is ever <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> personally do to help you, I shall be glad to know it and to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] she said. [...] "If <b>I</b> can't do <b>anything</b> else, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hop. My {{mother will}} soon have me all right. She knows all about such things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Willing was cautious. He {{took the}} name and address. [...] "I will see what can be done," [...] he said, non-committally. [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> else <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there <b>anything</b> more <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you, sir?" [...] inquired the man, {{after he}} had poured out my hot water and set out the {{contents}} of my portmanteau.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2010, Fry {{joined the}} board of {{directors}} at Norwich City Football Club. A lifelong fan of [...] "the Canaries" [...] and a regular visitor to Carrow Road, he said, on being appointed, [...] "Truly {{this is one of the}} most exciting days of my life, and I am as proud and pleased as I could be." [...] Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as [...] "Norwich City Ambassador". Fry said, [...] "My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I’m going to. It was all me. It can’t have been a coincidence ... But now I’m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City. We have so much to be proud of, both on and off the pitch, and I hope to welcome many new fans to the greatest club of all. On the Ball, City!" [...] In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of Proud Canaries, a new club for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't--I can't say I like it, but--" [...] With a burst {{which left}} him feeling large and shining with generosity, [...] "it's {{none of my}} darn business! I'll do <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you, if there's <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do to help}} you?" [...] he asked.

Is there <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “To be sure!” {{cried the}} professor, {{struck by the}} idea. “Why did I not think of that myself? I was too upset to think of <b>anything.</b> Yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> whistle for them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter Ruff," [...] he said, [...] "you're {{a clever}} scoundrel, but you've earned your five hundred guineas. Hang it, you're welcome to them! <b>Is</b> there <b>anything</b> else <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|R
