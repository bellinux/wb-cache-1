5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b>|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

25|$|In March 2007, Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> {{testified before}} a House Appropriations {{subcommittee}} that the consensus among the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States {{was that the}} Ninth Circuit was too large and unwieldy and should be split.|$|E
25|$|Justice Samuel Alito {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b> According to the Court, the Eighth Amendment requires prisoners to show there is a known and available alternative method of execution. The prisoners had failed to do this, the Court found, because the alternative drugs they proposed were unavailable to Oklahoma. The Court explained that Hill v. McDonough (2006) did not apply.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia, {{joined by}} Chief Justice William Rehnquist, <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> filed a dissenting opinion. [...] Attacking the majority’s {{statutory}} interpretation Justice Scalia wrote, “for this Court {{to create such}} a monstrous scheme in time of war, and in frustration of our military commanders’ reliance upon clearly stated prior law, is judicial adventurism of the worst sort.” ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision handed down on February 23, 2011, the Court unanimously (8-0, with Justice Elena Kagan not {{taking part in}} this case) reversed the California courts and held that federal preemption does not apply.

And he knew it," [...] referring to Kennedy's actions during the Chappaquiddick incident, the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, <b>and</b> the <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> Supreme Court nomination.|$|R
25|$|Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, {{who both}} joined the {{plurality}} in part, also each filed opinions concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part. Chief Justice William Rehnquist filed an opinion concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part, which {{was joined by}} Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> none of whom joined {{any part of the}} plurality. Justice Scalia also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was also joined by Rehnquist, White, and Thomas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the conference}} of the Justices two days after oral argument, Justice Souter defied expectations, joining Justices O'Connor, Stevens, and Blackmun, who had {{likewise}} refused to do so three years earlier in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. This resulted in a precarious five Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions. However, Justice Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter to write a plurality opinion that would reaffirm Roe.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} a seminal one {{in the history of}} {{abortion}} decisions in the United States. It was the first case that provided an opportunity to overturn Roe since the two liberal Justices, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, were replaced with the Bush-appointed Justices David Souter <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b> Both were viewed as ostensible conservatives compared with their predecessors. This left the Court with eight Republican-appointed justices—six of whom had been appointed by Presidents Reagan or Bush, both of whom were well known for their opposition to Roe. Finally, the only remaining Democratic appointee—Justice Byron White—had been one of the two dissenters from the original Roe decision.|$|E

50|$|The {{other three}} justices concurred in the {{judgment}} reversing the Ninth Circuit, but dissented {{on the issue of}} standing. They found Michael Newdow did have standing to bring the suit. Thus, they proceeded to examine the constitutional question, and in doing so they found it did not offend the Constitution. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote an opinion in which the other two joined in part; and both justice Sandra Day O'Connor <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> wrote their own separate opinions.|$|R
25|$|Simon rose to {{national}} {{attention in the}} 1960s, {{due in part to}} his well-researched book, Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years. Despite being published 100 years after Abraham Lincoln's death, it was the first book to exhaustively cite original source documents from Lincoln's eight years in the General Assembly. He later went on to write more than 20 books {{on a wide range of}} topics, including interfaith marriages (he was a Lutheran and his wife, Jeanne, was a Catholic), global water shortages, United States Supreme Court nomination battles that focused heavily on his personal experiences with Robert Bork <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> his autobiography, and even a well-received book on slain Illinois preacher Elijah Lovejoy. His final book, Our Culture of Pandering, was published in October 2003, two months before his death.|$|E
500|$|In 1993 and 1994, McCain {{voted to}} confirm President Clinton's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he {{considered}} to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court.

500|$|Justice Samuel Alito, {{joined by}} Justices Antonin Scalia <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> dissented from the Court's {{decision}} striking down the Act. For Alito, the ruling had [...] " [...] sharply {{from a long}} line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no legitimate interest." [...] "The Stolen Valor Act," [...] Alito wrote, [...] "represents the judgment of the people's elected representatives that false statements about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards... is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem, and it presents no threat to freedom of expression." ...|$|E

25|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court, in which Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice David Souter, <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> joined. Justice Byron White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justice Harry Blackmun and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined in full, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in part.

A year later, Tilleman had {{the prestigious}} honor of being {{selected}} {{as a law}} clerk by both Chief Justice Warren Burger <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> at the United States Supreme Court from 1992-93. [...] No other Canadian Olympian (and it appears no other Olympian from any country) has also been selected as a law clerk by a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|R
500|$|Justice Scalia dissented {{from the}} {{decision}} of the Court, due to the belief that Rust mandated a ruling upholding the restriction. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Associate Justices Sandra Day O'Connor <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> joined the dissent. Scalia wrote, [...] "The [...] is a federal subsidy program, not a federal regulatory program ... regulations directly restrict speech; subsidies do not." [...] He disagreed with the majority's contention that there was viewpoint discrimination, arguing that no specific viewpoint was restricted. Scalia was also concerned with dicta within the majority opinion that seemed to him to indicate a [...] "fondness" [...] for the concept of reform through the courts. His dissent argued that the majority's holding was [...] "unprecedented" [...] {{because it was the first}} time the government would be limited in advocating its own message.|$|E
500|$|While chairman, Biden {{presided over}} the two most {{contentious}} U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings in history, those for Robert Bork in 1987 <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> in 1991. In the Bork hearings, he stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination {{he had made the}} previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately. At the close, he won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage, as his 1988 presidential campaign collapsed {{in the middle of the}} hearings. [...] Rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other Bork opponents were making, Biden framed his discussion around the belief that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text, and that Bork's strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view. Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote, and then rejected in the full Senate by a 58–42 margin.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia, {{joined by}} Justice Samuel Alito <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> concurred in the {{judgment}} only. [...] Justice Scalia states in his concurring opinion that the Supreme Court should defer {{to state and local}} legislators and that the Supreme Court should not get involved in local election law cases, which would do nothing but encourage more litigation: ...|$|E
5000|$|Justice Samuel Alito {{issued a}} dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia, <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b> Justice Alito {{argued that the}} Fair Housing Act never {{authorized}} such disparate impact claims in 1968, when the law was enacted, [...] "and nothing has happened since then to change the law's meaning". Justice Thomas also issued a separate dissenting opinion in which he questioned Justice Kennedy's reliance upon Griggs v. Duke Power Co. to support {{the conclusion that the}} Fair Housing Act permits disparate impact claims.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{wrote the}} dissent, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b> Scalia {{asserted}} that Amendment 2 did not deprive anyone of the [...] "protection [...] general laws {{and policies that}} prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings", which he said was confirmed by the Colorado Supreme Court and not disputed by Justice Kennedy's opinion. [...] Scalia's dissent said Amendment 2 merely provided that homosexuals [...] "cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws". [...] His objections also included these: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court held that civil {{forfeiture}} proceedings are [...] "subject to {{the limitations of}} the Eight Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause." [...] Justice Antonin Scalia filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, writing that the majority should not have decided whether in rem forfeitures always amount to a punishment of the owner. Justice Anthony Kennedy also filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist <b>and</b> Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b>|$|R
2500|$|But in a February 2007 {{interview}} with Hannity, Giuliani {{said he would}} nominate Supreme Court justices who are [...] "very similar, if {{not exactly the same}} as," [...] John Roberts and Samuel Alito. [...] In a February 2007 {{interview with}} Hugh Hewitt, Giuliani mentioned those two as well as Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> as models, and said that former Solicitor General Theodore Olson would possibly be one of his primary advisers in selecting judges on lower federal courts as well as Supreme Court justices. He further stated that abortion would still not be a litmus test and such views would not even be asked of any prospective nominee.|$|E
2500|$|On June 27, 1997, {{the last}} day of the term, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist alongside Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> found that the Brady Act’s attempted commandeering of the sheriffs to perform background checks violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] In his opinion of the Court, Justice Scalia stated that, although there is no constitutional text precisely responding to the challenge, an answer can be found “in historical understanding and practice, the structure of the Constitution, and in the jurisprudence of this Court.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrd was {{the only}} senator to vote against {{confirming}} both Thurgood Marshall <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> to the United States Supreme Court, the only two African-American nominees. In Marshall's case, Byrd asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover {{to look into the}} possibility that Marshall had either connections to communists or a communist past. With respect to Thomas, Byrd stated that he was offended by Thomas' use of the phrase [...] "high-tech lynching of uppity blacks" [...] in his defense and that he was [...] "offended by the injection of racism" [...] into the hearing. He called Thomas' comments a [...] "diversionary tactic" [...] and said [...] "I thought we were past that stage." [...] Regarding Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges against Thomas, Byrd supported Hill. Byrd joined 45 other Democrats in voting against confirming Thomas to the Supreme Court.|$|E
