40|$|Abstract AIM: Aim of {{this study}} was to report the authors' {{experience}} with the anterior transperitoneal approach, and with an anterior submesocolic approach in case of left sided lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1994 to January 2011, 122 males and 170 females with a mean age of 50. 7 years (range: 19 - 84) underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) at 2 centers in Ancona and Rome (Italy) (that follow the same protocol). Fifteen patients underwent bilateral LA, the anterior transperitoneal approach was used in 233 cases (79. 8 %) and the anterior submesocolic in 59 (20. 2 %). One hundred and two patients had Conn's syndrome, 51 miscellaneous lesions, 55 Cushing's syndrome, 47 incidentalomas, 46 pheochromocytoma, 2 metastatic masses, 2 myelolipomas and 2 <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The lesions had a mean diameter of 3. 24 cm (range: 0. 5 - 10). RESULTS: Mean operating time was 120 minutes (range: 30 - 390). Conversion to open surgery was required in 13 cases (4, 45 %). Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during the operation. There were 5 major complications. Mobilization and resumption of diet occurred on the first postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 4. 32 days (range: 2 - 30). DISCUSSION: Early identification and ligature of the adrenal vein, with minimal gland manipulation, are the major advantages, especially in case of pheochromocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Adrenal masses can be successfully treated using a laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior approach, in presence of a suitable anesthesiological and surgical team's experience.

40|$|Long term {{administration}} of aldosterone (1) or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DCA) (2) to nor-mal subjects has been shown, in certain instances, to produce continued renal potassium loss but only transient sodium and chloride retention. This adjustment of the renal response to sodium-retain-ing adrenal steroids has been termed an "escape" (3) from the expected {{effects of these}} compounds, and is seen clinically {{in the absence of}} edema with primary aldosteronism. The mechanism of this "escape " from sodium retention, that occurs de-spite continued excess of steroid sodium-retaining substances, is unknown. Some findings have sug-gested that the adrenal gland may play a role by producing a substance which either promotes sodium excretion or inhibits the sodium-retaining effect of other hormones. An adrenal cortical "salt-losing hormone " was postulated by Wilkins and Lewis (4) and Jailer (5) to explain renal salt loss in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Rosemberg (6) suggested that this might be explained by an aldosterone-in-hibiting effect of certain 21 -desoxypregnane ste-roids, and Klein and co-workers (7) reported that partially purified material from urine of pa-tients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused increased urinary sodium excretion in rats.

40|$|The <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{associated}} with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (1) {{is in many}} of its aspects the direct opposite of the other syndrome which may result from adrenal hyper-plasia, namely, Cushing's syndrome (2). For example, the former is characterized by rapid growth before epiphyseal closure, {{and an increase in}} strength, muscle mass, and skin thickness, whereas the latter is characterized by cessation of growth before epiphyseal closure, and a decrease in strength, muscle mass and skin thickness. Since the effect of adrenocorticotropic hor-mone (ACTH) in subjects with normal adrenals is essentially to produce a temporary "Cushing's syndrome medicamentosa " (3 - 7) it was of interest to observe the effects of ACTH in the adreno-genital syndrome.

We report a case of adrenal myelolipoma associated with <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A 65 -year-old woman presented with a complaint of abdominal discomfort. CT showed a mass with abundant fatty density in the left adrenal gland suggesting myelolipoma. She was small and thin. External genitalia had a female appearance, but showed type III abnormality in Prader's classification with clitoral hypertrophy. She had a history of primary amenorrhea. Endocrinological examination revealed marked increase in the 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (or 17 -OHP) and pregnanetriol levels. On the basis of clinical features and laboratory values, simple virilizing type congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency was made. The left adrenal tumor was surgically removed and histologically proved to be myelolipoma. Tumor-uninvolved adrenal area adjacent to myelolipoma showed adrenocortical hyperplasia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of adrenal myelolipoma to be associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency in Japan.

40|$|On {{the long}} {{multistage}} pathway of biosynthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol to cortisol, testo­sterone and estradiol, due to mutations in genes, {{there is the}} deficiency of steroidogenesis enzymes in the adrenal glands: cholesterol desmolase, 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17 α-hydroxylase, 21 -hydroxylase, and enzymes of steroidogenesis in the testis: 17, 20 -desmolasis, 17 β-hydroxystyrol dehydroreductase and others, {{as well as a}} complex of widespread congenital diseases of heterogeneous group with autosomal recessive type of inheritance — <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AGS). Deficiency of any of these enzymes or transport proteins leads to partial or complete loss of their activity. Phenotypic manifestations of AGS are quite polymorphic: phenomenon of hypoadrenocorticism; violation of the nature and rates of sexual development; bilateral increasing of adrenal glands; hypercorticotropinemia sensitive to dexamethasone; oligo- or amenorrhea; anovulatory infertility, miscarriage in early pregnancy. Pathogenetic component of these signs is congenital disorder of steroidogenesis caused by 11 β-hydroxylase deficiency and symptoms of androgen excess. In AGS, there are distinguished a phenotype and nonclassical forms of steroidogenesis enzyme deficiency. In most cases, both types of diseases occur in persons of both sexes with different course — from mild to severe forms of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Congenital 21 -alpha hydroxylase {{deficiency}} is a syndrome {{characterized by}} a cortisol synthesis deficiency and, rarely, by testicular masses. We present a case of bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the testis without adrenal hyperplasia in a patient affected by 21 -alpha hydroxylase deficiency. This mass mimicked a testicular tumor and made differential diagnosis with a Leydig cell tumor extremely difficult. Multiple hard nodules (1 cm in diameter) could be palpated in both testes but were more prominent on the right. After an unsuccessful 30 -day trial of an adrenocorticotropic hormone suppression regimen with dexamethasone (0. 5 mg/qid), a right total orchifunicolectomy was performed. The final histological diagnosis was that of multiple, well-circumscribed nodules consisting of cord-like and microalveolar-like Gonadal stroma, typical of an <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and fibrosis. Differential diagnosis between testicular nodules in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumors is a major clinical challenge. In cases of cortisol suppression resistant testicular masses, a serum adrenal hormone profile obtained from the gonadal vein and histology of the testicular nodule (with parenchyma sparing surgery) are recommended to obtain a correct diagnosis.

Both children died at a very young age. Recently, MCAD deficiency was diagnosed in the youngest child of this family, now a 34 -year-old woman. This family history illustrates the variable clinical expression of MCAD deficiency, which can cause death but can also run a milder or even subclinical course.

40|$|Serum {{and urine}} steroids were {{examined}} in two subjects with trophoblastic disease accompanied by large ovarian theca-lutein cysts and compared with those from 10 patients with trophoblastic disease but without palpable cysts. In the patients without cysts normal values were obtained for serum oestradiol, progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione, and for urinary total oestrogens, pregnanediol, pregnanetriol, and 17 -oxosteroids. Nineteen urinary steroid metabolites, quantified by capillary gas-liquid chromatography, were either within reference limits or marginally raised. In several cases relatively minor increases in serum testosterone and cortisol and urinary free cortisol were observed. In contrast, the subjects with cysts showed pronounced excesses of androgen metabolites, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, pregnanediol, and pregnanetriol, and both exhibited a similar pattern of unusual additional metabolites. The profiles superficially resembled those seen in 21 -hydroxylase deficiency <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but there were important discrepancies reflecting known differences in ovarian and adrenal steroid metabolism.

This article first describes functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary tumors with immunohistochemistry. Thyroid carcinomas exhibit a full variety of clinical and pathological characteristics according to histological types, including papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, undifferentiated carcinomas, and medullary carcinoma. The former four are follicular epithelial in origin and the latter is derived from C cells. Histological subtypes of papillary carcinoma have been well correlated with the abnormality of genes. A follicular variant of papillary carcinoma may have some diagnostic problems, among pathologists, with regard to its differentiation from follicular adenoma and adenomatous goiter.

40|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} and the adrenal medulla {{functionally}} quite distinct, are discussed separately. Knowledge of the steroid biosynthesis with its three productive pathways (glycocorticoids, mineralcorticoids and sex hormones) is essential {{not only to}} understand the physiopathology of the adrenal cortex, but also to delineate the necessary diagnostic hormonal screening tests and the applied treatment modalities. When surgery is indicated, a precise preoperative evaluation of the patient is essential with correction of all possible anomalies. With this all in mind, the Cushing syndrome, the <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the primary aldosteronism (Conn) are discussed with regard to etiology and treatment. Patients who underwent a bilateral adrenalectomy are likely to {{live a normal life}} as long as the hormonal substitution therapy (glycocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) is adequate. When stress situations, such as surgery, do occur, adjustments of this therapy are essential. The pathology of the adrenal medulla confronts us with the problems of pheochromocytoma. An adequate preoperative preparation of the patients with adrenergic blocking agents and fluid support allows for a surgical intervention with a low morbidity and mortality. In conclusion surgery of the adrenals requires a perfect knowledge of the associated physiopathology and a close cooperation between the endocrinologist, the surgeon and the anesthesiologist.

40|$|The {{importance}} to clinical medicine and surgery of the metabolism of the hormone of {{the adrenal cortex}} is becoming increasingly more evident from the recent work of many investigators. It {{has long been known}} that in the human, destructive lesions of the adrenal cortex are responsible for the fatal disease described by Addison in 1855 and which bears his name. In Addison's disease, the symptoms and signs are pigmentation of skin and mucous membrane, gastro-intestinal disturbances, asthenia, low blood pressure, dehydration and hamoconcentration (increased sodium excretion, low blood sodium), high blood potassium and hypoglycemia in the terminal stages.

Study cases were selected from the files of participating hospitals and subclassified according to current classifications: 20 with Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), 2 with testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs), 2 with testicular tumors of <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TTAGS), and 2 with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). An extensive immunophenotypic panel including markers used in sex cord-stromal cell tumors, androgen hormones, enzymes, and receptors was applied to the cases and 10 non-tumoral adrenal glands. Non-tumoral tissues were scored separately. RCs were present in 90 % of LCTcases and all cases with normal Leydig cells; RCs stained specifically with calretinin and 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 BHSD) and were present only in cells with high concomitant expression of both proteins, a phenotype unique to Leydig cells and LCTs. Leydig cells from AIS cases lack RCs due to decreased expression of 3 BHSD. Calretinin is decreased in testicular adrenal-like tumors and absent in normal adrenocortical cells, which explain why they lack RCs. Calretinin expression in androgen-producing cells is independent from androgen receptors and androgen synthesis. RCs represent for the most part, if not exclusively, crystallized forms of a 3 BHSD/calretinin complex. Androgen-producing cells containing and lacking RCs differ mainly in the level of expression of these proteins and androgen receptors...|$|E
40|$|Background: The current {{neonatal}} screening program ("the heel prick") involves {{taking a few}} drops of blood from almost every newborn in the Netherlands to determine whether the child is suffering from one of three congenital disorders: phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroid, or <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This study investigated the preferences and views of parents and future parents with respect to information about, and consent to, {{neonatal screening}} and the possible expansion of the program. Methods: Seven focus group discussions took place with future parents, parents with a healthy child, and parents with children affected by disorders for which screening is possible, now or in the future (total of 36 participants). The discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed for content. Results: Parents were not well informed about what the heel prick involves at present. Nevertheless, they see it as a routine procedure and do not think about the possibility of refusing it. If the heel-prick program were to be expanded, parents would like to be informed earlier, preferably during pregnancy. In addition, most parents preferred an opt-out consent approach. Conclusions: If the neonatal screening program is to be expanded, parents would prefer for information about the program be given during pregnancy. In addition, they preferred an opt-out consent approach, on condition that screening was for the purpose of preventing irreversible harm. Parental opinion was divided on this issue if the aim of screening were to be widened. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} perioperative results of the anterior approached laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) in a large cohort of patients, and report {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of this route. Methods: 204 patients, 125 female and 79 male with a mean age 52. 8 years (range, 19 - 75 years), underwent LA by the anterior transperitoneal approach from 1994 to 2005 in our institution. There were 100 right and 114 left LAs. Ten patients underwent bilateral LA. Associated surgical procedures were performed in 17 cases. During the same period 47 LAs had been performed by different approaches (flank and submesocolic). Results: Mean operative time was 80 minutes for right (40 - 150), 109 minutes for left (64 - 300) and 194 minutes for bilateral adrenalectomy. Intraoperative major complications were observed in six patients. Mortality occurred in one diabetic patient who was converted to open surgery because of a colonic perforation and subsequently developed a Candida sepsis in the postoperative course. The mean size of lesion removed was 6. 2 cm (1. 5 - 12 cm). Oral intake started within 24 hours and the mean hospital stay was 2. 5 days (1 - 8 days). Histology results were as follows: nonsecreting adenoma 65, Cushing's adenoma 58, Conn's adenoma 53, pheochromocytoma 24, metastases 9, myelolipoma 3, <b>adrenogenital</b> <b>syndrome</b> 1, carcinoma 1. Conclusions: LA by anterior transperitoneal approach is safe and effective in our experience, despite the inherent limitation that this was not a prospective randomized study. The main advantage of this route is early ligature of the adrenal vein on both sides, enabling the performance of associated surgical procedures and bilateral adrenalectomy. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E
