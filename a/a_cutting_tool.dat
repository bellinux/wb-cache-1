25|$|Hobbing is a {{machining}} process for gear cutting, cutting splines, and cutting sprockets on a hobbing machine, {{which is a}} special type of milling machine. The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> called a hob. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|E

25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E

2500|$|The adze ( [...] ; {{alternative}} spelling: adz) is <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> shaped {{somewhat like}} an axe {{that dates back}} to the stone age. It can be any tool with a sharp cutting edge. Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle. Two basic forms of an adze are the hand adze, a short handled tool swung with one hand, and a foot adze, a long handled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands, the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level. The blade of an adze is set at right angles to the tool's shaft (like a hoe or plane), in contrast to an axe's blade, which is in plane with the shaft. A similar, but blunt, tool used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock.|$|E
