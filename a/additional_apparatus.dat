25|$|Langley {{arrived in}} Pittsburgh in 1867 {{to become the}} first {{director}} of the Allegheny Observatory, after the institution had fallen into hard times and been given to the Western University of Pennsylvania. By then, the department was in disarray – equipment was broken, there was no library and the building needed repairs. Through the friendship and aid of William Thaw, a Pittsburgh industrial leader, Langley was able to improve the observatory equipment and build <b>additional</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> One of the new instruments was a small transit telescope used to observe the position of the stars as they cross the celestial meridian. He raised money for the department in large part by distributing standard time to cities and railroads. Up until then, correct time had only occasionally been sent from American observatories for public use. Clocks were manually wound in those days and time tended to be imprecise. Exact time had not been especially necessary. It was enough to know that at noon the sun was directly above the head. All that until railroad tracks were installed.|$|R

50|$|A {{train describer}} is {{originally}} an <b>additional</b> <b>apparatus</b> at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information.

A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display. The electric relay interlocking boxes were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|E

5000|$|Sakari Pinomäki's first company, PIKA Forest Machines, is {{credited}} with designing the first self-propelled tree length timber processor, the PIKA Model 60, in 1968, and the first fully mobile timber [...] "harvester", the PIKA Model 75, in 1974. These machines differed significantly from other [...] "retro-fitted" [...] forestry machines in that they were designed from inception to be timber harvesting and processing equipment, and were not conventional farming or earth moving equipment with <b>additional</b> <b>apparatus</b> welded onto them to allow timber processing work to be possible. Pinomäki coined the term [...] "harvester" [...] to describe his Model 75 machine, which differs from a tree length processor in that a harvester grips, fells, de-limbs and sections the tree on site, while a processor simply de-limbs a tree that has been felled by chain saws and dragged to the delimbing equipment. His designs and innovations have been subsequently copied by at least five other major manufacturers of heavy timber equipment, including Timberjack, Valmet and Ponsse, and were instrumental in developing the [...] "Scandinavian" [...] system of timber harvesting, which is far more sustainable and nature conserving than the methods employed up till the mid-20th century. The two machine harvester-forwarder system consequently became the worldwide standard for sustainable forestry.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we put forward an {{approach}} to deriving and applying human error tolerance requirements. Such requirements {{are concerned with the}} response of a system to errors introduced by human operators. The approach provides a means by which operators ’ tasks can be described and analysed for likely errors and the impact of these errors on system safety can be explored. The approach, based on previous work by the same authors, uses a software engineering notation to provide the bridge between operator models and systems engineering concerns. In this paper the approach is extended to include a more refined understanding of the processes that contribute to human error. The operators ’ process in achieving goals is understood in terms of structured tasks. With this <b>additional</b> <b>apparatus</b> we are able to capture a more complex set of human error forms. ...|$|E
40|$|Accurate vision-aided {{inertial}} navigation depends on proper calibration {{of the relative}} pose of the camera and the inertial measurement unit (IMU). Calibration errors introduce bias in the overall motion estimate, degrading navigation performance- sometimes dramatically. However, existing camera-IMU calibration techniques are difficult, time-consuming and often require <b>additional</b> complex <b>apparatus.</b> In this paper, we formulate the camera-IMU relative pose calibration problem in a filtering framework, and propose a calibration algorithm which requires only a planar camera calibration target. The algorithm uses an unscented Kalman filter to estimate the pose of the IMU in a global reference frame and the 6 -DoF transform between the camera and the IMU. Results from simulations and experiments with a low-cost solid-state IMU demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} approach. ...|$|R

The behavior of thin ink streak line can be observed through the transparent walls of the pipe to give some information of the pipe flow.

We are forming {{a community of}} networked wearable computer users to explore, over a long period, the augmented realities that these systems can provide. By adapting its behavior to the user's changing environment, a body-worn computer can assist the user more intelligently, consistently, and continuously than a desktop system. A text-based augmented reality, the Remembrance Agent, is presented to illustrate this approach. Video cameras are used both to warp the visual input (mediated reality) and to sense the user's world for graphical overlay.

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we have {{investigated}} the behaviour of magnetorheological fluids under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 40 bar. We have designed, manufactured and tested a magnetorheological damper with a novel architecture, which provides {{the control of the}} internal pressure. The pressurewas regulated by means of an <b>additional</b> <b>apparatus</b> connected to the damper that acts on the fluid volume. The magnetorheological damper was tested under sinusoidal inputs and with several values for the magnetic field and internal pressure. The results show that the new architecture is able to work without a volume compensator and bear high pressures. On the one hand, the influence of the hydrostatic pressure on the yield stress of the magnetorheological fluids is not strong, probably because the ferromagnetic particles cannot arrange themselves into thicker columns. On the other hand, the benefits of the pressure on the behaviour of the magnetorheological damper are useful in terms of preventing cavitation...|$|E
40|$|Convective heat {{transfer}} during hot pressing in wood-based composite panel manufacturing is widely accepted {{as the most}} important means of heat transport for resin curing. The rate of convective {{heat transfer}} to the panel core is controlled by its permeability. Permeability in the plane of the panel also controls the flow of vapor to the panel edges, thereby influencing the potential for panel “blowing”. This research considers how flake thickness, flake alignment and changing mat density during hot-pressing influences OSB mat permeability, through its thickness and in the plane of the panel. Some previous research exists but it fails to address the affects of horizontal and vertical density gradients as well as flake alignment. An apparatus was designed to allow cold pressing of aligned flakes to desired densities while enabling permeability measurements through the mat thickness. An <b>additional</b> <b>apparatus</b> was designed to allow the measuring of permeability in the plane of the mat. These designs permitted permeability measurements in mats that had no vertical density gradient, allowing for the direct study of permeability versus density (compaction ratio).
