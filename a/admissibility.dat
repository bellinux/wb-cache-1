5|$|On 22 July 2013, Gerardo Martino was {{confirmed}} {{as manager of}} Barcelona for the 2013–14 season. Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de España, which Barça won 1–1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the <b>admissibility</b> of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the <b>admissibility</b> of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that the trial judge made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the <b>admissibility</b> of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his capture}} Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand jury had returned 2 years earlier. The start of the trial was delayed until September 1991 due to complex legal maneuvering over whether Noriega could be tried after his detention as a prisoner of war, the <b>admissibility</b> of evidence and witnesses, and {{how to pay for}} Noriega's legal defense. The trial ended in April 1992, when Noriega was convicted on eight of the ten charges of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the <b>admissibility</b> of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|When {{used in a}} {{court of}} law digital {{evidence}} falls under the same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence; courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines. In the United States the Federal Rules of Evidence are used to evaluate the <b>admissibility</b> of digital evidence, the United Kingdom PACE and Civil Evidence acts have similar guidelines and many other countries have their own laws. US federal laws restrict seizures to items with only obvious evidential value. This is acknowledged as not always being possible to establish with digital media prior to an examination.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the <b>admissibility</b> of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the <b>admissibility</b> of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E
25|$|The <b>admissibility</b> of {{forensic}} evidence is {{left up to}} the judgement of the court. To provide a strong basis of <b>admissibility</b> for the evidence, accurate documentation is essential {{so that there is}} no room for speculation as to the authenticity of the evidence. Given that <b>admissibility</b> is granted, expert witnesses may be called to a courtroom to either support or refute the conclusions that are derived from the evidence submitted.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>admissibility</b> {{criterion}} guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, {{it also means}} that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the <b>admissibility</b> criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|The Law Commission for England and Wales has {{proposed}} a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the Daubert Standard to help reform the law of evidence {{in regards to the}} <b>admissibility</b> of scientific evidence.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} {{there have been a}} number of notable {{decisions}} that provide an indication of the way the Committee interprets the criteria used to determine <b>admissibility</b> as well as providing evidence of the practical application of the ICCPR.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 2009 {{the case}} was brought before the European Court of Human Rights. The hearing was for the <b>admissibility</b> of the State vs. State case, a rare {{occurrence}} in this court with a ruling still pending.|$|E
25|$|For ψ to be a wavelet for the {{continuous}} wavelet transform (see there for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an <b>admissibility</b> criterion (loosely speaking, {{a kind of}} half-differentiability) {{in order to get}} a stably invertible transform.|$|E
25|$|The {{determination}} of the production and <b>admissibility</b> of documents under the Jencks Act is not adversarial in nature, but only a proceeding to discharge the responsibility to enforce the Act. It is not {{the responsibility of the}} defense to prove that the document should be produced.|$|E
25|$|The <b>admissibility</b> of an {{intervention}} {{is subject to}} conditions. The so-called notice of intervention must notably be filed within {{three months of the}} date on which proceedings referred to in Article 105 are instituted. An admissible intervention is treated as an opposition. If the intervention is admissible, the intervener becomes party to the opposition proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 Act {{extensively}} {{changed the}} law regarding the <b>admissibility</b> into {{evidence of a}} defendant's convictions for previous offences, and his other misconduct, broadening {{the circumstances in which}} the prosecution could introduce such matters. It also imposed statutory restrictions, for the first time, on the ability of defence lawyers to cross-examine prosecution witnesses about their own criminal records.|$|E
25|$|The Act made {{substantial}} {{reforms to}} the <b>admissibility</b> of hearsay evidence, building upon the {{reforms of the}} Criminal Justice Act 1988, which regulated use of business documents and absent witnesses. Various categories of the common law were preserved and the remainder abolished. A new power was incorporated to permit hearsay evidence if certain 'interests of justice' tests were met.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 2015, the PCA {{published}} the award by the tribunal on Jurisdiction and <b>Admissibility</b> for the case. The tribunal {{found that it}} has jurisdiction to consider the following seven Philippines’ Submissions. (Each number is the Philippines’ Submissions number.) The tribunal reserved consideration of its jurisdiction to rule on Nos. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 14.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{entomology}} {{deals with}} the collection of arthropodic evidence and its application, and {{through a series of}} tests and previously set of rules, general <b>admissibility</b> of said evidence is determined. Forensic entomology may come into play in a variety of legal cases, including crime scene investigation, abuse and neglect cases, accidents, insect infestation, and food contamination.|$|E
25|$|When {{shipping}} {{products from}} one country to another, the products may have to be marked with country of origin, and the country of origin will generally be required to be indicated in the export/import documents and governmental submissions. Country of origin will affect its <b>admissibility,</b> the rate of duty, its entitlement to special duty or trade preference programs, antidumping, and government procurement.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{separate}} {{issues in the}} Filioque controversy of Christianity, the orthodoxy of the doctrine itself and the liceity (legitimacy) of the insertion of the phrase into the Nicene Creed. Although {{the debate over the}} orthodoxy of the doctrine preceded the question of the <b>admissibility</b> of the phrase as inserted into the Creed, the two issues became linked when the insertion received the approval of the Pope in the eleventh century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of formal rules, the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada exerted great control over form, nature, and <b>admissibility</b> of questions. The first {{codification}} of formal rules to govern Question Period occurred in April 1964, and subsequent rule changes have been adopted; however, {{the opinion of the}} Speaker carries the most weight, as the actions of the Speaker set precedents when a new Point of Order or questions arises about practices during Question Period.|$|E
25|$|A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is {{that the}} {{evidence}} obtained through breaching a right is inadmissible in court. This initially developed in the courts as a presumption of exclusion but was subsequently lessened to a balancing exercise where various factors are weighed up to determine the <b>admissibility</b> of evidence tainted by a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990. This remedy is now reflected in section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} to expand <b>admissibility</b> of bad character evidence were also opposed {{on the grounds}} of unfairness (the defendant's past bad character can more easily be adduced than a witness's) and of dangerous irrelevance. The measures reforming hearsay, which were more closely modelled on the Law Commission's report than the other reforms, attracted less adverse attention, though the Bar Council disputed some of its aspects. The maximum period a suspected terrorist could be detained without charge was increased from 7 to 14 days. This was later increased to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.|$|E
25|$|Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case. The Court {{ruled on}} the <b>admissibility</b> of {{clinical}} opinions given by two psychiatrists {{hired by the}} prosecution in answer to hypothetical questions regarding the defendant's future dangerousness and the likelihood that he would present a continuing threat to society in this Texas death penalty case. The American Psychiatric Association submitted an amicus curiae brief {{in support of the}} defendant's position that such testimony should be inadmissible and urging curtailment of psychiatric testimony regarding future dangerousness and a prohibition of such testimony based on hypothetical data.|$|E
25|$|Bladel then {{objected to}} the <b>admissibility</b> of the {{confession}} but the trial court overruled his objection. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} three life sentences to run consecutively. On appeal from his conviction and sentence, Bladel challenged the confession. The Michigan Court of Appeals first rejected that challenge and affirmed the conviction, but, after reconsideration in the light of a recent decision by the State Supreme Court, it reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Michigan Supreme Court then granted the prosecutor's application for leave to appeal, and considered the case with respondent Jackson's appeal of his conviction.|$|E
25|$|Plea bargain {{negotiations}} {{take place}} in the AP Parts prior to the case being in a trial-ready posture, and depending upon caseloads, the judges in the AP Parts may conduct pre-trial and felony motion hearings. The most common pre-trial evidence suppression hearings are Mapp (warrantless searches and probable cause), Dunaway (confessions), Huntley (Miranda rights), Wade (identification evidence like lineups), and Johnson (Terry stops) hearings. Trial Parts also conduct pre-trial motion hearings, including Sandoval (witness impeachment) and Molineux (<b>admissibility</b> of prior uncharged crimes) hearings. Once pretrial hearings are completed, the case is considered ready for trial and will usually be transferred to a courtroom that specializes in handling trials.|$|E
25|$|As long {{as these}} two {{criteria}} are satisfied, the data replicas converge (with additional constraints) after all operations are executed at all sites. There {{is no need}} to enforce a total order of execution for the sake of achieving convergence. Their approach is generally to first identify and prove sufficient conditions for a few transformation functions, and then design a control procedure to ensure those sufficient conditions. This way the control procedure and transformation functions work synergistically to achieve correctness, i.e., causality and <b>admissibility</b> preservation. In their approach, there {{is no need to}} satisfy transformation properties such as TP2 because it does not require that the (inclusive) transformation functions work in all possible cases.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung– ZPO) {{does not}} provide for a special {{proceeding}} for complex class action litigation. However, Austrian consumer organizations (Verein für Konsumenteninformation/VKI and the Federal Chamber of Labour/Bundesarbeitskammer) have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers. In these cases the individual consumers assigned their claims to one entity, who has then brought an ordinary (two party) lawsuit over the assigned claims. The monetary benefits were redistributed among the class. This technique, soon labelled as “class action Austrian style”, allows for a significant reduction of overall costs. The Austrian Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has confirmed the legal <b>admissibility</b> of these lawsuits {{under the condition that}} all claims are essentially based on the same grounds.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Daubert Standard {{is a legal}} {{precedent}} set in 1993 by the Supreme Court {{regarding the}} <b>admissibility</b> of expert witness testimony during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods. When multiple forensic artists produce approximations for {{the same set of}} skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete. Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the Daubert Standard, is not considered a legally recognized techniques for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} legal dramas (e.g., The Defenders, Matlock, Perry Mason and L.A. Law), the court {{proceedings}} are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters {{trying to prove}} the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the arraignment of defendants,the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning <b>admissibility</b> of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually {{as a result of}} plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.|$|E
25|$|Between 1972 and 1976, Collins appealed {{his murder}} {{conviction}} on four further occasions; citing contentions that the Michigan Murders had received extensive media publicity in Washtenaw County, and that five separate motions for {{change of venue}} had been submitted by the defense counsel (two {{of which had been}} filed throughout the actual jury selection process) upon the grounds of pretrial publicity minimizing any chance of obtaining an unbiased jury in Washtenaw County. Each motion filed had been reserved or, in the final instance, denied. His lawyers further argued that, at an evidentiary hearing in April 1970, shortly before jury selection had begun, Collins' indictment for the California murder of Roxie Ann Phillips had likewise received extensive media coverage in Washtenaw County—further reducing the chances of potential jurors being unbiased. Moreover, a psychologist retained by the defense had testified as such on April 20, 1970. This psychologist had been adamant that Collins' trial should be held outside Washtenaw County, and this motion had likewise been reserved. Furthermore, Collins' lawyers argued issues such as the <b>admissibility</b> of testimony relating to the microscopic analysis of hair samples presented at his trial, and the denial of defense motions to suppress prosecution witnesses testifying against their client.|$|E

500|$|On 8 March, Thomas {{was interviewed}} again by {{two members of}} the AFP, who had made special {{arrangements}} with the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal Evidence Act 1995 and Crimes Act 1914, so that admissible evidence could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice. During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the <b>admissibility</b> of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by Tawfiq bin Attash, a high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant involved with the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the USS Cole bombing. On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that [...] "the <b>admissibility</b> of [...] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised." ...|$|E
