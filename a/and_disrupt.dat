5|$|Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) was a {{paramilitary}} {{organization of}} the Nazi Party created in 1920 to police party rallies <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> their opponents' meetings. By the time the Nazis seized power in 1933, it had grown to almost four million men. It was commanded by Ernst Röhm, who was shot in 1934 on Hitler's orders after refusing to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} US unit sent into Korea to absorb the initial North Korean advances, <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the more {{numerous}} North Korean units. The 24th Division effectively delayed the North Korean advance to allow the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units to establish a defensive line around Pusan.|$|E

5|$|The Venizelist advance was not {{an attempt}} to {{undermine}} the king's pact with Bénazet, since it had been planned long before that. The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the Thessaloniki provisional government.|$|E
5|$|The {{researcher}} {{might also}} measure the organisation by {{its use of}} communication, transportation, size, and distribution of power relative to the population. (Russell 1938:130,132-134) Improved abilities to communicate and transport tend to stabilise larger organisations <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|At party {{meetings}} in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to disrupt Adolf Hitler's speeches, and fought with party members. It {{was decided that}} a permanent group of party members would serve to protect Nazi officials at rallies <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the meetings of opposing parties. The basis for the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) had been formed. Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA. In 1923, Heiden joined a small personal bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler named Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E

5|$|In {{the lead}} up to the assault on Musa Qaleh, members of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force {{provided}} vital intelligence for the upcoming operation. Coalition military manoeuvres and a build-up of troops and supplies continued for weeks before the assault. On 1 November, British forces started reconnaissance patrols {{in preparation for the}} attack. In the middle of that month, the MOD reported that troops from Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF), 40 Commando Royal Marines and the Right Flank Company of the Scots Guards were patrolling outside the town to confuse the Taliban insurgents <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> their supply routes.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the battle plans of both armies.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, Shakur's {{attorneys}} filed papers asking Judge Appleby {{to subpoena}} FBI Director Clarence Kelley, Senator Frank Church {{and other federal}} and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> black activist organizations. Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also {{asked the court to}} require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E

5|$|The Browns began play in 1946, and Rymkus {{soon became}} an anchor of the team's {{offensive}} and defensive lines. He solidified his reputation for toughness by playing more than 50 minutes per game that year despite a knee injury for which he needed surgery immediately after the season. On defense, Rymkus helped stop opponents' rushing attacks <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the opposing quarterback. On offense, he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and opened up running room for fullback Marion Motley. Graham led the AAFC in total passing yards over its four years of existence, while Motley {{led the league in}} rushing.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> their formations.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean U-boat Campaign lasted {{approximately}} from 21 September 1941 to May 1944. The Kriegsmarine {{tried to}} isolate Gibraltar, Malta, and Suez <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> Britain's trade routes. More than sixty U-boats {{were sent to}} interdict Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. Many of these U-boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain. Nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged.|$|E

The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) Radar jamming and deception systems to detect <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> hostile radar signals {{in addition to the}} electronic warfare capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} autumn of 1808, the French Navy {{despatched}} four large frigates to the East Indies. These ships, stationed on Île de France and Île Bonaparte, {{were ordered to}} attack <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> British trade routes from the Far East, in particular British India. This disruption was intended to have a negative financial effect on the British economy and force the Royal Navy to send ships into the Indian Ocean, expending valuable resources in doing so. The commander of this French force was Commodore Jacques Hamelin, a highly skilled officer who ordered his frigates to disperse in the Bay of Bengal to hunt British East Indiamen, large and well armed merchant ships that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between Britain and her Empire ever year.|$|E

5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{therefore}} planned with these three airborne divisions in mind, {{with all three}} to be dropped behind German lines {{in support of the}} 21st Army Group as it conducted its amphibious assaults to breach the Rhine. However, during the earliest planning stages, it became apparent that the 13th Airborne Division would be unable to participate in the operation, as there were only enough combat transport aircraft in the area to transport two divisions effectively. The plan for the operation {{was therefore}} altered to accommodate the two remaining airborne divisions, the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions. The two airborne divisions would be dropped behind German lines, with their objective to land around Wesel <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> enemy defences in order to aid the advance of the British Second Army towards Wesel.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>disrupt</b> the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E
