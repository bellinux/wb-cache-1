5|$|As Wilson {{adjusted}} his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for {{the positions of}} Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times, Chairman Lane was selected since {{he was one of}} the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst. At the time, it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, March 4; however, The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson's appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson's Cabinet appointees.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid.

Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims.

5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on October 4, 1940, winning via second-round stoppage over Joe Echevarria. Robinson fought five more times in 1940, winning each time, with four wins coming {{by way of}} knockout. In 1941, he defeated world champion Sammy Angott, future champion Marty Servo and former champion Fritzie Zivic. The Robinson-Angott fight was held above the lightweight limit, since Angott {{did not want to}} risk losing his lightweight title. Robinson defeated Zivic in front of 20,551 at Madison Square Garden—one of the largest crowds in the arena to that date. Robinson won the first five rounds <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times Joseph C. Nichols, before Zivic came back to land several punches to Robinson's head in the sixth and seventh rounds. Robinson controlled the next two rounds, and had Zivic in the ninth.

5|$|The {{station has}} eight tracks and four island platforms. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City Transit Authority, {{this makes it}} one of the world's largest {{elevated}} transportation terminals, as well as the largest in North America. The westernmost tracks, tracks 5–8, gradually slope downward, so tracks 1–4 are slightly higher than tracks 5–8 at the station's south end. There are ADA-compliant ramps from the three easternmost platforms (the Culver, Brighton, and Sea Beach Lines' platforms, respectively) to the main station building below the platforms; a non-ADA-compliant ramp leads from the West End Line (eastern) platform, with steps. An ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the West End Line platform leads to an overpass that connects to another ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the Sea Beach Line's platform. There are also stairways down to the station building. The southern two-thirds of the station is under the solar-panel-covered roof, while the northern third of the station is in the open air, not covered by anything. The shed is lit up by platform floodlights during the night hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{contributed to}} the general atmosphere of tension and fear in Europe. It relieved {{some of the pressure}} on Germany that had arisen {{in the aftermath of the}} Anschluss and tested the Soviets' willingness to defend their interests in Eastern Europe. Fears were expressed, both in Lithuania and abroad, that the establishment of diplomatic relations was not the only goal of Warsaw and that more far-reaching ultimata might follow. Speculations arose that Poland might seek to resurrect the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, using Germany's annexation of Austria as a precedent. Poland announced that it planned to create a neutral bloc comprising Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania to counter both fascism and communism. It stated that it had no wish to incorporate Lithuanian territories and maintained that the bloc would be formed on the basis of bilateral non-aggression and economic treaties. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times, the impact of the ultimatum was felt on Wall Street; on March 17, the foreign currency and bond markets sagged, in some cases reaching the lowest points seen in several years. These markets recovered on March 19, after the ultimatum was accepted.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E
