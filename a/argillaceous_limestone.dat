25|$|In the Lower Eocene, Basin {{conditions}} became restricted, {{producing an}} alternating dolomite and anhydrite sequence with a consistent thickness. The mid-Eocene saw {{development of a}} wide carbonate platform, richly nummulitic, also constant in thickness. There are <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> interbeds, marl, and occasional calcareous sandstones. The Late Eocene reflects more frequent lateral variations of interbedded limestones, dolomites, marls, and shales.|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} Cotentin Peninsula {{belongs to}} the Armorican Massif, the Plain {{is part of the}} Paris Basin. <b>Argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> from the Sinemurian {{contributes}} to the region's dairy product appellation (AOC) Isigny-Sainte-Mère, which it shares with Bessin. Horse breeding has long been practiced in the Plain, which is regarded as the cradle of the Anglo-Norman horse breed, the product of English stallions and mares from the Cotentin Peninsula.|$|E
30|$|Neritic to basinal marls and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Pabdeh Formation {{deposited}} in a Paleocene–Eocene transgression which {{resulted from the}} Late Cretaceous tectonic activities. This formation consists of shale, marl, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> (Soleimani et al. 2013). A monotonous deep-water shale facies with a limestone unit in its middle part is the main lithology of the Pabdeh Formation. Based on lithological characteristics, the Pabdeh represents deposition in a deep-water, anoxic environment in an overall transgressive sequence. In the northern Persian Gulf, the Asmari and Gurpi formations overlay and underlie the Pabdeh Formation, respectively. There {{appears to be a}} transition to clean limestones of the Jahrum Formation toward the southwest (Sharland 2001). Regional equivalents of the Pabdeh Formation are the Umm er Radhuma, Rus, and Dammam formations.|$|R
30|$|The Jurassic {{starts at}} the lower Dogger with the Formation de Gundershoffen and the Formation de Printzheim (Toarcian), {{composed}} mainly of clays and silty clays. As the name suggests, the Marnes de Schillersdorf (Toarcian) are composed of black micaceous and silty clays, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> interbedded with calcareous nodules.|$|R
30|$|From 2009 {{laboratory}} tests and pilot production trials of natural hydraulic limes from various <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> to limited scale have been launched [3], however until {{now there are}} no manufacturers of hydraulic limes in China, therefore currently all natural hydraulic limes for the research and application in China are imported either from France or from Germany.|$|R
6000|$|The clay-slate is {{generally}} fissile, sometimes siliceous or ferruginous, with veins of quartz and calcareous spar; it often assumes, {{especially on the}} loftier mountains, an altered feldspathic character, passing into feldspathic porphyry: occasionally it is associated with breccia and grauwacke. At Good Success Bay, {{there is a little}} intercalated black crystalline limestone. At Port Famine much of the clay-slate is calcareous, and passes either into a mudstone or into grauwacke, including odd-shaped concretions of dark <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone.</b> Here alone, on the shore a few miles north of Port Famine, and on the summit of Mount Tarn (2,600 feet high), I found organic remains; they consist of:-- ...|$|E
60|$|After {{passing for}} a few miles over the coast {{granitic}} series, {{we come to the}} porphyritic conglomerate, with its usual characters, and with some of the beds distinctly displaying their mechanical origin. The strata, where first met with, are, as before stated, only slightly inclined; but near the Hacienda of Pluclaro, we come to an anticlinal axis, with the beds much dislocated and shifted by a great fault, of which not a trace is externally seen in the outline of the hill. I believe that this anticlinal axis can be traced northwards, into the district of Arqueros, where a conspicuous hill called Cerro Blanco, formed of a harsh, cream-coloured euritic rock, including a few crystals of reddish feldspar, and associated with some purplish claystone porphyry, seems to fall on a line of elevation. In descending from the Arqueros district, I crossed on the northern border of the valley, strata inclined eastward from the Pluclaro axis: on the porphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass, some hundred feet thick, of brown <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> in parts crystalline, and in parts almost composed of Hippurites Chilensis, d'Orbigny; above this came a black calcareous shale, and on it a red conglomerate. In the brown limestone, with the Hippurites, there was an impression of a Pecten and a coral, and great numbers of a large Gryphaea, very like, and, according to Professor E. Forbes, probably identical with G. Orientalis, Forbes MS.,--a cretaceous species (probably upper greensand) from Verdachellum, in Southern India. These fossils seem to occupy nearly the same position with those at the Puente del Inca,--namely, {{at the top of the}} porphyritic conglomerate, and at the base of the gypseous formation.|$|E
50|$|The Formation is {{composed}} of crystalline and dolomitized limestone (Cooking Lake Formation) in off-reef areas, bituminous shale and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> detrital limestone (reef fallout), stromatoporoid calcarenite (Duvernay Formation), gray shale, <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> argillaceous dolomite, crystalline dolomite (Ireton Formation). In reef build-ups, it consists of massive limestone and dolomite with porosity (Leduc Formation).|$|E

2500|$|... "Natural" [...] cements {{correspond}} to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, produced by burning <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> at moderate temperatures. The level of clay {{components in the}} limestone (around 30–35%) is such that large amounts of belite (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adjective}} [...] "argillaceous" [...] is {{also used}} to define rocks in which clay minerals are a secondary but significant component. For example, <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> are limestones consisting predominantly of calcium carbonate, but including 10-40% of clay minerals: such limestones, when soft, are often called marls. Similarly, argillaceous sandstones are sandstones consisting primarily of quartz grains, with the interstitial spaces filled with clay minerals.|$|R

40|$|The sediments of the, Cambrian, Lancara Formation show {{features}} which suggest their {{deposition in}} a shallow marine environment. The occurrence of stromatolites might indicate that some sediments were deposited in an intratidal environment. The gradual change, upward in the stratigraphie section, from stromatolite deposits via calcarenites to <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> and shales is being interpreted as a transgressive marine sequence.

50|$|The Man on the Hill (MOTH) {{locality}} {{of northwestern}} Canada has fossils {{that are very}} well preserved and have {{had a profound impact}} on the understanding of vertebrate evolution. The geology of the MOTH locality consists of fine, alternating laminae of light grey <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> or calcareous shale, and dark grey silt to sand-rich calcareous shale, as observed in thin section, and the characterization of the lithology for the vertebrate-bearing strata as an interlaminated <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> and calcareous shale. The abundance of cryptic trace fossils and the presence of pyrite suggest that the intra-shelf topographic sag at MOTH had restricted circulation and was generally hypoxic (Zorn et al. 2005).|$|E

50|$|Falling {{sea levels}} {{continued}} {{right into the}} Middle Jurassic. Near Pau an oolite barrier started to grow that extends all the way north to Poitiers. It divided the sedimentary basin now into two major facies domains: a deeper western domain open to the Atlantic and undergoing infratidal sedimentation (black to blueish <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> rich in benthic organisms, microfilaments, and ammonites) and a shallow, enclosed, eastern domain with intertidal sedimentation (variable carbonate facies like pseudo-oolites and banded dolomites, but also anhydrite-bearing evaporites).
