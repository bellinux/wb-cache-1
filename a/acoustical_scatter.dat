40|$|Acoustic {{cavitation}} {{plays an}} important role in a broad range of biomedical, chemical and engineering applications, because of its magnificent mechanical and chemical effects. Particularly, the irradiation of the multi-frequency acoustic wave could be favouritely employed to promote these effects, such as enhancing the intensity of sonoluminescence, increasing the efficiency of sonochemical reaction, and improving the accuracy of ultrasound imaging and tissue ablation. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the bubble dynamics under the multi-frequency acoustic irradiation is essential for promoting these effects in the practical applications. The objective of this PhD programme is to investigate the bubble dynamics under dual-frequency excitation systematically with respect to bubble oscillations, the <b>acoustical</b> <b>scattering</b> cross section and the secondary Bjerknes force (a mutual interaction force between two oscillating bubbles). Spherical gas bubbles in water are considered. Both analytical analysis based on perturbation method and numerical simulations have been performed in this thesis. The analytical solutions of the <b>acoustical</b> <b>scattering</b> cross section and the secondary Bjerknes force under dual-frequency excitation have been obtained and validated. The value of the secondary Bjerknes force can be considered as the linear combination of the forces derived under the single-frequency approaches. The predictions of those analytical solutions will be impaired for the cases with large acoustic pressure amplitudes. The numerical simulations reveal some unique features of the bubble dynamics under dual-frequency excitation, e. g., the combination resonances (i. e., their corresponding frequencies corresponding to the linear combinations of the two component frequencies) and the simultaneous resonances (i. e., the simultaneous occurrence of two resonances in certain conditions). The influence of a number of paramount parameters (e. g., the pressure amplitude, the equilibrium bubble radii, the power allocation between the component waves, the phase difference and the driving frequency) on the bubble dynamics under dual-frequency excitation is also investigated with demonstrating examples. Based on that, the parameters for optimizing the dual-frequency approach are proposed. In addition, the effects of thermal effects and mass transfer on the bubble dynamics have also been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Waves {{propagating}} in {{a medium}} with highly variable refractive index tend to focus forming caustics. The energy content of the wavefield {{in the vicinity of}} a caustic is higher than that of the ambient field away from the caustic. Consequently, waves scattering from heterogeneities located near caustics have more energy than a field scattering a little further away from the caustic. For a suitable choice of Sobolev norms for the domain and range spaces of the scattering operator, the restriction to scatterers supported away from caustics is a bounded operator, whereas the restriction to scatterers supported in a neighbourhood of caustics is unbounded. 1 Introduction This paper concerns the idealization of an <b>acoustical</b> <b>scattering</b> experiment which geophysicists carry out to estimate the local speed of wave propagation in the earth.

Krill (mainly Thysanoessa inermis) was primarily found below the mesopelagic fish and above planktivorous demersal fish (Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii).

40|$|AbstractClassic {{scattering}} from {{objects of}} arbitrary shape must generally {{be treated by}} numerical methods. It has proven very difficult to describe scattering from general bounded objects without resorting to frequency-limiting approximations. The starting point of many numerical methods is the Helmholtz integral representation of a given wavefield. From that point several departures are possible for constructing computationally feasible approximate schemes. To date, attempts at direct solutions have been rare. One method (originated by P. Waterman) that attacks the exact numerical solution for a very broad class of problems begins with the Helmholtz integral representations for a point exterior and interior to the target in a partial wave expansion. After truncating the partial wave space, one arrives at a set of matrix equations useful in describing the field. This method {{is often referred to}} as the T-matrix method, null-field, or extended integral equation method. It leads to a unique solution of the exterior boundary integral equation by incorporating the interior solution (extinction theorem) as a constraint. In principle, there are no theoretical limitations on frequency, although numerical complications can arise and must be appropriately dealt with for the method to be computationally reliable. For submerged objects the formalism will be outlined for <b>acoustical</b> <b>scattering</b> from targets that are rigid; sound-soft and penetrable; elastic solids; elastic shells; and layered elastic objects. Finally, illustrations of several numerical examples for the above will be presented to emphasize specific response features peculiar to a variety of targets...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{backscatter}} systems (ABS) {{can be used}} to non-intrusively measure {{profiles of}} both the concentration and particle size of suspended sediments in the marine environment. Inversion of ABS measurements into sediment size and concentration requires knowledge of two scattering parameters, namely the total normalised scattering cross-section, χ, and the form function, f. χ quantifies the <b>acoustical</b> <b>scattering</b> by a given particle over all angles, relative to its cross sectional area, and represents attenuation due to particle scattering losses. f describes the backscattering characteristics of a particle relative to its geometrical size. In recent years, {{a number of studies have}} presented measurements of f and χ for populations of sediments sieved over narrow size ranges, thereby essentially providing values for nominally a single particle size in suspension. In the present study, we extend these works by looking at the impact that a broad particle size distribution has on the form of f and χ. Here we model and measure the average form function for a broad size distribution (σ = ± 0. 35 a 0, where σ is the standard deviation about the mean particle radius, a 0) of suspended glass spheres, whose scattering characteristics are well documented. The model is in close agreement with the provisional measurements, and suggests that for populations of suspended glass spheres with broad size distributions, the form function increases by about 40 % in the Rayleigh regime (λ >> 2 πa 0, where λ is the wavelength of the sound in water), whilst decreasing by a factor of around 25 % in the geometric regime (λ << 2 πa 0), relative to that obtained for populations with a nominally single size in suspension.

40|$|AbstractA {{frequency}} domain Immersed Boundary (IB) method {{was developed and}} validated in the present paper using 2 -dimenstional <b>acoustical</b> radiation and <b>scattering</b> cases. The IB method was incorporated with Linearized Euler Equations (LEE) in the {{frequency domain}} in the present work. The governing equations were spatially discretisized using the DRP scheme. A pseudo time dependant term {{was added to the}} frequency domain equations, allowing the use of a conventional time-marching algorithm to converge the solutions in the pseudo-time domain. Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) were placed at boundaries of computational domain where non-reflective conditions were expected. PML technique was also implemented inside the rigid body to stabilize the computation. The impermeable boundary condition {{on the surface of the}} geometry is guaranteed by finding the inverse of an influence matrix, which establishes the relationship between boundary forces and induced velocity. Numerical computations were performed for 2 -dimensional acoustic radiation and scattering problems. Computational results were compared with exact solution and yielded good agreement, providing a solid validation of the current method. The method is expected to extend to higher dimension and applied to more complex problem like wake/airfoil interaction simulations in turbomachinery...|$|R
