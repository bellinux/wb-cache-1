30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has been}} {{reported}} that the selectivity towards acetone formation was decreased by increasing the reaction temperature over Co–Al sample in consistence with the increase of acetaldehyde, ethylene and ethyl acetate (Fig.  12). While, over Mn–Al sample, the acetone selectivity increases with the gradual increase in the reaction temperature (Fig.  13), accordingly, the selectivity towards acetaldehyde decreases. The acetone selectivity shows a maximum at 400  °C and then decreased in consistence with an increase in ethylene and acetic acid. This indicates that the <b>acetone</b> <b>synthesis</b> might occur on the metal surface and the two metals behave in a different catalytic manner with the gradual increasing in reaction temperatures.|$|E
30|$|The {{alteration}} of redox balance to promote NADH generation {{has been reported}} in many studies using corn or glucose as substrate. The methods of provision of artificial electron carriers such as neutral red [26],[18] and methyl viologen [27]-[29], ORP regulation [30], and inhibition of hydrogenase by spraying carbon monoxide [31],[32], all of them have effect on enhancing butanol/acetone ratio. Among these approaches, adding neutral red seems to be the most appropriate one of low-cost and easy to operate. In the previous works, it has been demonstrated that adding neutral red could acquire a 63 % increment in butanol/acetone ratio with corn-based substrate [26],[18]. Therefore, neutral red was added into cassava broth at 60  h when butanol production rate was in a relatively high level, in order to further enhance butanol/acetone ratio. The results indicated that final butanol concentration could slightly increase, due to the enhancements in rNADH and adhE transcriptional level after neutral red addition. However, the metabolic fluxes of organic acid formation/re-assimilation pathway and ctfAB transcription level were also enhanced after supplementing neutral red (Figures  5 and 6), which was actually beneficial for acetone formation. The simultaneous enhancement of both butanol and <b>acetone</b> <b>synthesis</b> route led to an unchanged butanol/acetone ratio in cassava-based fermentation with neutral red addition. It was speculated that under the reductive compound-enriched environment using cassava-based substrate, reductive power NADH might have been excessively produced/consumed leading to a burden on cellular metabolism [33]. To match up relatively low fluxes of the acid loops with enhanced NADH regeneration in an appropriate way will be the key issue in obtaining further high butanol/acetone ratio while maintaining comparably high butanol productivity.|$|E
25|$|The 1917 {{synthesis}} by Robinson {{is considered}} a classic in total synthesis due to its simplicity and biomimetic approach. Tropinone is a bicyclic molecule, but the reactants used in its preparation are fairly simple: succinaldehyde, methylamine and acetonedicarboxylic acid (or even <b>acetone).</b> The <b>synthesis</b> {{is a good example}} of a biomimetic reaction or biogenetic-type synthesis because biosynthesis makes use of the same building blocks. It also demonstrates a tandem reaction in a one-pot synthesis. Furthermore, the yield of the synthesis was 17% and with subsequent improvements exceeded 90%.|$|R

This thesis aims to study on TiO 2 and its hybrid nanostructures. A brief introduction and literature review on the titanium dioxide synthesis, modifications {{as well as}} potential applications which will be presented in Chapters 1 and 2, respectively. Chapter 3 presents an <b>acetone</b> assisted sol-gel <b>synthesis</b> method for preparing monodispersed TiO 2 nanoparticles under mild conditions. The experimental parameters, colloidal growth mechanism, and role of <b>acetone</b> in the <b>synthesis</b> process were systematically studied. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared particles were compared with commercial titanium dioxide P 25 powder under the same conditions. To enhance the functional properties of photocatalysis, the nanocomposites of silver and titanium dioxide with different nanostructures were fabricated in Chapter 4, in which silver@titanium dioxide core-shell nanostructures were found to exhibit excellent performance in photo degradation of organic molecules, nearly double high efficiency to the pure titanium dioxide. The mechanism was studied by density functional simulation (DFT) method. To further explore the multi-functionality of silver-titanium dioxide composites, Chapter 5 assessed the bacterial growth inhibition and bactericidal ability between silver@titanium dioxide core-shell nanostructures and silver doped {{on the surface of}} titanium dioxide nanostructures. In chapter 6, a general applied titanium dioxide coating strategy was developed on a variety of core particles (such as Au, Ag, Fe 2 O 3, V 2 O 5, SiO 2) with different functionalities.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility that}} the cutaneous permeability barrier regulates epidermal DNA synthesis in two acute and two chronic models of barrier perturbation. In animals treated topically with <b>acetone,</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> is increased 102 %, in tape-stripped animals 127 %, in essential fatty acid deficient animals 50 %, and in animals chronically treated with topical lovastatin 64 %. This linkage between disturbances in barrier function and increased DNA synthesis is further supported by specific and correlative observations: (a) in these disparate models, artificial replacement of the barrier with a water-impermeable membrane inhibits the expected increase in DNA synthesis; (b) the extent of the burst in DNA synthesis is proportional to the degree of barrier abrogation; (c) the inhibition of DNA synthesis by membranes {{is directly related to the}} degree of permeability of these occlusive membranes, i. e., the more impermeable the greater the degree of inhibition; (d) topical treatment with lipids that restore barrier function corrects the increase in DNA synthesis; and (e) barrier abrogation with acetone produces an increase in epidermal DNA synthesis without altering bulk protein synthetic rates in contrast to events known to follow injury or cell replacement. Autoradiographic studies show that the increase in DNA <b>synthesis</b> after <b>acetone</b> treatment is limited to the epidermal basal layer. This constellation of findings strongly suggests that cutaneous barrier function is one factor that regulates epidermal DNA synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Single-phase titania {{nanomaterials}} {{were prepared}} by autoclaving titanium tetrachloride in acetone at 80 - 140 °C. Depending on the molar ratio of TiCl 4 to acetone (TiCl 4 /Ac), TiO 2 materials with different phases and morphologies were obtained. When the TiCl 4 concentration was {{no higher than}} TiCl 4 /Ac) = 1 / 15, single-phase anatase TiO 2 nanocrystals in sizes ranging from 4 to 10 nm were prepared by tuning TiCl 4 /Ac ratios from 1 / 90 to 1 / 15. However, when the TiCl 4 concentration was high enough (e. g., TiCl 4 /Ac ≥ 1 / 10), single-phase rutile TiO 2 nanofibers were obtained selectively. The materials were characterized comprehensively using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and nitrogen adsorption measurements. With the aid of GC/MS analysis of organic products in the liquid phase, it is shown that the controlled hydrolysis of TiCl 4 with water, which was in situ generated from the TiCl 4 -catalyzed aldol condensation reactions of acetones, {{played an important role}} in the formation of the titania nanomaterials. Some of the organic condensates mayfunction to stabilize the phase and morphology of the materials. This mechanism was also supported by our success in using other ketones as alternatives to <b>acetone</b> in the <b>synthesis...</b>|$|R
40|$|To whom {{requests}} for reprints should be addressed The broccoli constituent sulforaphane (l-isothiocyanate- 4 -methylsulfinylbutane) has previously been shown to protect rats against 9, 10 -dimethyl-lr 2 -benz[a]anthracene tumori-genesis, thought to be due, at least in part, to induction of phase II detoxification. We investigated the ability of sulforaphane to also inhibit the phase I enzyme cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1), {{which is responsible for}} activation of several carcinogens, including dialkylnitros-amines. Using the / 7 -nitrophenol hydroxylation assay in microsomes from livers of acetone-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, sulforaphane was shown to be a potent competi-tive inhibitor of CYP 2 E 1 with a Kx of 37. 0 ± 4. 5 uM. In view of this result, we studied the capacity of sulforaphane to inhibit the genotoxicity of /V-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Sulforaphane at concentrations of> 0. 8 uM inhibited the mutagenicity of NDMA (4. 4 mg/plate) in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 after pre-incubation for 45 min with cytosol extract from livers of Balb/c mice pre-treated with <b>acetone.</b> Unscheduled DNA <b>synthesis</b> induced by NDMA (33. 5 (lM) in mouse hepatocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by sulforaphane at 0. 064 - 20 uM. Sulforaphane was unable to inhibit muta-genicity of sodium azide (5 (ig/plate), a direct acting mutagen, in the Salmonella assay. It was not itself genotoxic in hepatocytes, as measured by unscheduled DNA synthesis, or mutagenic in the strain of Salmonella employed and cytotoxic only at high concentrations (5 = 03 mM). These findings suggest that inhibition of CYP 2 E 1 by sulforaphane may offer chemoprotection against carcinogenic substrates of this enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The aldol {{condensation}} {{is often used}} regarding the synthesis of different fine chemicals like fragrances and their precursors. In the petrochemical industry, the {{aldol condensation}} {{is also used to}} produce more valuable chemicals. In the course of this thesis, several heterogeneous catalysts, mainly based on rare earth oxides, were used to accelerate this reaction. Synthesis of 4 -(4 -Hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -on. The main focus of this thesis was the synthesis of 4 -(4 -Hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -on out of 4 -HBA and acetone. As catalysts, rare earth oxides were used, as full catalysts as well as impregnated on different carrier materials. It could be shown that the very slow reaction can be highly accelerated by adding the mentioned catalysts. The most active catalyst, which was tested during this thesis was 1 wt% La 2 O 3 /TiO 2. This catalyst showed extraordinary high performance and yields of over 97 % could be reached with an almost 100 % selectivity. However in a continiuous flow experiment the catalyst showed a deactivation within several days due to the accumulation of organic material. After a recalcination of the catalyst, the activity could be fully restored. Synthesis of pseudoionone. The synthesis of pseudoionone was investigated in a similar way. Again the rare earth metal oxides were tested and the 3 wt% La 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was found as most active catalyst with a selectivity of 87 % at complete conversion. The catalytic perpormance of 1 wt% La 2 O 3 /TiO 2 was also tested in several different aldol condensations: Synthesis of cinnamon aldehyde. The synthesis of cinnamon aldehylde from benzaldehye and acetaldehyde was investigated. Due to the high reactivity of acetaldehyde compared to acetone, autocondensation products like crotone aldehyde were found. Therefore the amount of acetaldehyde was limited (5 : 1 ratio of benzaldehyde to acetaldehyde). With these reaction parameters, conversion of 15 % benzaldehyde with a selectivity of 86 % to cinnamon aldehyde could be achieved. <b>Synthesis</b> of vanillidine <b>acetone.</b> The <b>synthesis</b> of vanillidine <b>acetone</b> is very simmilar to the synthesis of 4 -(4 -Hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -on. Therefore the same reaction parameters were chosen and with the same catalyst a complete conversion with 98 % selectivity to vanillidine acetone could be achieved. Synthesis of pulegone. Quite different to the other tested condensations, the synthesis of pulegone from acetone and 3 -MCHN could be achieved. The product spectrum showed a high amount of various products which are mainly formed by the autocondensation of acetone like diacetone alcohol, mesityle oxide or isomesityle oxide. The desired product however could only be found in traces. The reason for this poor results was the inversion of the methylene component and the carbonyl component. Synthesis of 4 -(2 -Furyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -on. The synthesis of 4 -(2 -Furyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -on out of furfural and acetone was also investigated. It could be shown, that the starting materials are much more active than the materials in the previously described reactions and the reaction parameters had to be adjusted. The conversion had to be limited too, because of the formation of consecutive products...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{crystalline}} poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNIPAm-co-AAc) nanoparticle {{network in}} organic solvents {{was obtained by}} self assembling precursor particles in acetone/epichlorohydrin mixture at room temperature followed by inter-sphere crosslinking at ~ 98 °C. The crystals thus formed can endure solvent exchanges or large distortions under a temporary compressing force with the reoccurrence of crystalline structures. In acetone, the crystals were stable, independent of temperature, while in water crystals could change their colors upon heating or changing pH values. By passing a focused white light beam through the crystals, different colors were displayed at different observation angles, indicating typical Bragg diffraction. Shear moduli of the gel nanoparticle crystals were measured in the linear stress-yield ranges for the same gel crystals in both <b>acetone</b> and water. <b>Syntheses</b> of particles of different sizes {{and the relationship between}} particle size and the color of the gel nanoparticle networks at a constant solid content were also presented. Temperature- and pH- sensitive crystalline PNIPAm-co-AAc hydrogel was prepared using osmosis crosslinking method. Not only the typical Bragg diffraction phenomenon was observed for the hydrogel but also apparent temperature- and pH- sensitive properties were performed. The phase behavior of PNIPAm nanoparticles dispersed in water was also investigated using a thermodynamic perturbation theory combined with lightscattering and spectrometer measurements. It was shown how the volume transition of PNIPAM particles affected the interaction potential and determined a novel phase diagram that had not been observed in conventional colloids. Because both particle size and attractive potential depended on temperature, PNIPAM aqueous dispersion exhibited phase transitions at a fixed particle number density by either increasing or decreasing temperature. The phase transition of PNIPAm-co-AAc colloids was also studied. The results from the comparison between pure PNIPAm and charged PNIPAm colloids showed that the introducing of carboxyl (-COOH) group not only contributed to the synthesis of three-dimensional nanoparticle network but also effectively increased the crystallization temperature and concentration range. The phase transitions at both low and high temperatures were observed from the turbidity change by using UV-Vis spectrometer. Centrifugal vibration method was used to make crystalline PNIPAm-co-AAc dispersion at high concentration (8 %). The turbidity test proved the formation of iridescent pattern...|$|R
