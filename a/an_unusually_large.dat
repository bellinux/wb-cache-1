5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

A 2008 study of <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> outbreak of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Neki {{were from a}} surface trough that persisted near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean {{in the middle of}} October 2009. A weak {{tropical}} disturbance became evident in the trough on October15, and three days later the system began developing curved bands of convection on its northern and southern periphery. This created <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> gyre for the region. Following the formation of a well-defined circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-C late on October18, about 730mi (1175km) south of Ka Lae, Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The season {{produced}} fourteen tropical depressions, {{of which}} twelve intensified into tropical storms, four became hurricanes, and two became major hurricanes. The two most significant storms of the season, {{in terms of}} loss of life and damage, were hurricanes Isidore and Lili. Hurricane Isidore was <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> storm and attained maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205km/h), becoming {{one of only two}} major hurricanes during the season. Hurricane Lili was the strongest hurricane during the season, with winds reaching 145mph (230km/h) before moving ashore Louisiana as a much weaker system.|$|E

The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Cosme formed on June 19 from a tropical wave, the storm initially moved westward before being upgraded into Tropical Storm Cosme. It ultimately intensifying into a Category 1 hurricane. Cosme turned northward and made landfall near Acapulco {{during the night}} of June 21. It rapidly weakened over land. The storm caused excessive rainfall on land, leading to deadly and destructive flooding. It is estimated that 30 {{people died in the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence was {{the first}} North Atlantic {{hurricane}} to produce hurricane-force winds {{on the island of}} Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian in September 2003. The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence developed from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September3. Due to unfavorable conditions, the system failed to organize initially, and as a result, the storm grew to <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> size. After several days, Florence encountered an area of lesser wind shear and intensified into a hurricane on September10. It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward, and on September13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Neki was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on October18 as <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> disturbance from a trough south of Hawaii. Moving northwestward, it slowly organized at first due to its large size. After reaching hurricane status on October21, Neki intensified at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125mph (205km/h). It later turned {{to the north and}} north-northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions. While passing through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection. It caused little impact in the island chain. After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October27.|$|E

5|$|The season had eleven {{tropical}} depressions, {{of which}} nine intensified into tropical storms, three became hurricanes, and two became major hurricanes.

Hurricane Bill was <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> storm and was also the season's strongest, attaining winds of 135mph (215km/h).

On September 18, Ginger {{turned to the}} south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E

5|$|The {{actinide}} series derives {{its name from}} the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} June15, {{although}} an unnamed storm developed {{about a week}} prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The lone hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles.

5|$|Upon {{developing}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{the storm was}} moving west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge to its north. It was located over an area of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear, which favored gradual intensification. The convection diminished during a diurnal cycle before redeveloping the next day. Maintaining <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>large</b> size, the depression slowly organized, gradually separating from the trough from which it developed. On October19, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neki, and shortly thereafter the storm turned toward the northwest. By the next day, the cyclone resembled {{the structure of a}} monsoon depression typically found in the western Pacific Ocean. However, the structure began to more resemble a tropical cyclone after the outermost convection diminished and the thunderstorms around the center increased. Following the development of a banding-eye feature, Neki intensified into a hurricane early on October21 about 625mi (1010km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, or about 335mi (535km) east-southeast of Johnston Atoll.|$|E
