500|$|Although Monteux {{retained}} his vitality {{to the end}} of his life, in {{his last}} years he suffered occasional collapses. In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by Sir Adrian Boult, who recalled that as they left the platform, [...] "Monteux gave two little groans as we walked down the passage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." [...] Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.|$|E
500|$|Short Cuts {{was one of}} a trio of {{successive}} film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It {{was followed}} in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as [...] "simply outstanding" [...] by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe [...] "first established [...] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation." [...] The film historian David Thomson later described it as [...] "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s," [...] and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, [...] "They all came out at once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> had this profile. It was amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1988 Anna Wing {{began to}} grow disillusioned with the {{direction}} the show was going in. She felt EastEnders did not fit in with her beliefs as a Quaker, commenting [...] "We had 31 million viewers and it was shown all over the world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> thought 'Should I be in this?'...I had a crisis of conscience." [...] After three years playing Lou, Anna Wing asked to be written out. Wing has since revealed that creator Julia Smith was devastated {{when she decided to}} leave, commenting [...] "she said I could have been in it for ever and ever until I popped off for real." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{realized}} that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} of her {{endorsements}} too, Suzuki was faced {{with the problem of}} production companies refusing to sign her and tried to make a comeback {{in the next two years}} with little to no success. Her relationship with her producer, Tetsuya Komuro, also ceased. Sony also took {{all of her}} singles and albums released up to that point off CD shelves. Many people were convinced that her chances for making a comeback were nil. In 2003, Suzuki finally negotiated an out-of-court agreement with Sony. Her contract with the label was scheduled to end in December 2004. Eiji Yamada was subsequently fined for his role in the tax evasion. Government officials linked to the scandal included former Education Minister Takashi Kosugi and two other legislators, who allegedly received 34 million yen in unofficial payments for referring AG Communication and other clients seeking tax evasion. About this period, Suzuki herself has said [...] "I really didn't know what was going on, lots of lies were being thrown about in the media. For people to hear little things on the TV and believe that to be the truth was a surprise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> realized the kind of world I was in. What kept me going was the thought of one day being able to tell the truth myself" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} the 'eerie' feeling had come back again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{observed}} that no crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure that [...] "Bruno was somewhere very near.|$|E

"I am that same," [...] he answered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> looked with {{interest}} upon one whose {{name had been}} ringing through Italy these last few years. <b>And</b> then, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> realized why his face was familiar to me.

60|$|Mine was a milder and slighter experience, but its thrill was of {{the same}} kind.

60|$|The united force applied {{this time}} {{was so great that}} we tore asunder all the {{fastenings}} of the leg at one wrench, and Jack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> shot straight up, as if we had been discharged from a hole in the ground. Losing our balance we fell over each other on our backs--the wooden leg remaining hard and fast in the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{was walking}} there among the marshes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> found myself {{surrounded}} by the sea.

He wore the clothes of a fisherman, and he accepted half a crown, but I have my doubts about him even now. He said that his name was Mr. Andrew." ...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, a month afterwards, I was {{returning}} from a festivity with my intimate friend Smith, my distinguished friend Jobling, my most respectable friend Robinson, and my wittiest friend Jones. It was a clear, star-lit morning, and we seemed to hold the broad, beautiful avenue to ourselves; and I fear we acted {{as if it were}} so. As we hilariously passed the corner of Eighteenth Street, a coupe rolled by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> heard my name called from its gloomy depths.|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently I {{felt him}} stop and turn his horse; and then, when he spoke, I {{knew that he}} had not killed both the constables, and that one of them had {{followed}} him.

5000|$|On 5 September 1992, The Sun {{announced}} that the same call had also been recorded by another Oxfordshire eavesdropper, 25-year-old Jane Norgrove, who claimed she had recorded the call on New Year's Eve 1989, but [...] "didn't even listen to it.

60|$|When he was {{come to an}} end of the story, and Simon Kenton was not one to {{use more}} words than were necessary, I {{proposed}} that he go with me to my home, for by this time it was near to noon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>suddenly</b> lost all desire to continue the work of setting traps.|$|R
60|$|It was {{therefore}} {{with an almost}} infantile pleasure that I looked at all this promising expansion of fresh-cut timber and thought of the housing shortage at home. I know not by what incongruous movement of the mind there swept across me, at the same moment, the thought of things ancestral and hoary with the light of ancient dawns. The last war brought back body-armour; the next war may bring back bows and arrows. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> had a memory of old wooden houses in London; and a model of Shakespeare's town.|$|E
6000|$|I {{might have}} said [...] "Yes," [...] and gone back to nursery obscurity, and there, perhaps, mouldered {{for the rest of}} my life; but looking up at Madame, I saw in her countenance a {{something}} that made me think twice ere I decided. At that instant she did not wear a woman's aspect, but rather a man's. Power of a particular kind strongly limned itself in all her traits, and that power was not my kind of power: neither sympathy, nor congeniality, nor submission, were the emotions it awakened. I stood--not soothed, nor won, nor overwhelmed. It seemed as if a challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> felt all the dishonour of my diffidence--all the pusillanimity of my slackness to aspire.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a {{funny thing}} you know--how you don't notice things. In--let me see--1916, the German guns were {{a lot better than}} ours. Ours were old, and when they're old you can't tell where they'll hit: whether they'll go beyond the mark, or whether they'll fall short. Well, this day our guns were firing short, and killing our own men. We'd had the order to charge, and were running forward, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> felt hot water {{spurting}} on my neck--" [...] He put his hand {{to the back of his}} neck and glanced round apprehensively.

5000|$|He gained {{national}} prominence on his anti-conscription stance, he said, [...] "I suddenly {{decided to}} be a [...] [...] [...] objector to the Vietnam War.
