Analysis of the geometry of a 12 K carbon fibre 2 × 2 twill weave at the meso- and macro-scales showed the prevalence of the yarn path variations at the macro-scale over the meso-scale variations. Numerical <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> path variability showed that it is responsible for a Young’s modulus reduction of 0. 5 % and CoV of 1 % which makes this type of variability in the selected reinforcement almost insignificant for an elastic analysis. Finite element analysis of damage propagation in laminates with layer shift showed good agreement with the experiments. Both {{numerical analysis}} and experiments showed that layer shift has a strong effect on the shape of the stress-strain curve.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] image analysis techniques in the spatial and frequency domains for twist measurement <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> are described. A spatial technique is developed to extract the twist angle through the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> core image. Then, a Fourier transformation technique is applied to yarn images to measure the orientation of the fibre on the yarn surface. Finally, a hybrid method that incorporates frequency domain filtering prior to spatial analysis is proposed. The trials show that spatial analysis is a fast method and can successfully predict the twist in the yarn. Fourier transformation technique is quite sensitive to the protruding fibres obstructing the yarn surface, which may result in measurements having high variations. For yarns having little amount of hairs protruding from the core, the results agreed reasonably well with actual twist levels. Frequency domain filtering in conjunction with the spatial <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> surface is found to be superior in terms of accuracy.

Then the yarn hairiness image is treated by using thinning algorithm, so the thinned yarn hairiness image is obtained. With yarn axis and the margin of trunk as reference, and with proper baseline, yarn hairiness image skeleton is extracted at the pixel level, and the number of yarn hairiness of different length is determined by statistics.

The system comprises a yarn carriage unit, a video microscope and a personal computer. This system was used in conjunction with the well-known tracer fibre technique. This system enables digital images to be grabbed and continuous movies of the yarn to be recorded in order to facilitate the measurement of twist and the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> structure. Yarn samples from polyester, viscose and cotton with 35 tex and 485 turns/meter were spun from the roving with 2. 3 % of black fibres on the SKF laboratory ring frame.

The research described was primarily concerned with working towards {{the solution of the}} problem of yarn tension control when building conical packages on an open-end spinning machine at yarn delivery speeds of 500 m 1 min"cause of the total lack of published work on the mathematical modelling of the parameters affecting tension variation, a considerable amount of effort was spent in the establishment of this basic understanding. This mathematical analysis appears, in the main, in the appendices to this thesis. In addition to the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> tension variations depending on machine geometry parameters, mathematical models have also been produced which predict the effect on tension of fitting curved distribution bars of various shapes. The work includes the development of concept ideas which appeared capable of providing routes for solution of the tension control problem. These ideas were evaluated and compared against a design specification which was also developed as part of this research. Two promising concepts were selected for detailed investigation. These were: a pneumatic passive compensator and, a positive mechanical compensator. The pneumatic compensator was a novel idea which was conceived by the author, and which eventually provided a solution which met the design specification in every way. The mechanical compensator was shown to be a far less attractive concept with several serious problems which have been explored but not eliminated.

With an output of 32. 9 million tons in 2009, spun yarns satisfy more than half the needs of the global textiles and clothing industry. The present study is devoted to developing computational and digital methods and systems for the accurate and efficient analysis of three predominant aspects of spun yarns: yarn formation, internal structure and surface appearance. In this study, a new generalized theoretical model has been developed by using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the theoretical and numerical <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> formation in spinning triangle. In this proposed model, the initial conditions are formulated together with an algorithm for fiber buckling. Compared with the earlier models, some important parameters ignored previously, such as inclined angle of spinning tension, frictional contact of fibers with bottom roller and fiber torsional strains, are considered. Numerical simulations were then carried out to explore the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of ring spinning triangle and various spinning parameters. Further comparison results showed that fiber tensions predicted by the proposed model are in good agreements with earlier models while the calculated torque of yarns is generally closer to experimental measurements. Moreover, a dynamic model of spinning triangle has been further developed in this study based on the above static FEM model with consideration of the dynamic characteristics of fiber inertia and damping for a more complete and accurate description. By this model, the dynamic behavior of fibers in spinning triangle, such as the natural frequency, mode shape, resonant response, harmonic analysis and response under a time-varying tension, has been originally studied. The results showed that dynamic parameters have a great influence on the amplitude and attenuation of the response of constituent fibers in spinning triangle. Tracer fiber measurement has been widely used for <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> internal structure by tracing the fiber path in a transparent liquid. Currently, the image mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images largely involve manual operation. It is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent computer method has been developed for automatic mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images. In this method, an extended QRS complex detection method is developed for tracer fiber detection. A decision function, integrating several matching functions extracted from tracer fiber and gradient image, is proposed for image mosaic. An objective method is then proposed to evaluate the qualities of image mosaic and segmentation of the proposed method. Fifty series of tracer fiber images (total 872 images) with five different yarn counts (10 Ne~ 60 Ne) were prepared and used for a full evaluation of the proposed image processing method with respect to conventional manual method. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method works well in mosaic and segmentation for tracer fiber images and presents a much higher efficiency than the conventional method. For yarn surface evaluation, an intelligent computer method has been developed to analyze yarn blackboard image and objectively evaluate yarn quality using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The evaluation method for yarn surface quality currently in use is mainly based on manual inspection. Although some works have been done on digital yarn analysis in order to resolve the limitations of human visual inspection, none of them can fully imitate human behavior in the inspection of yarn quality on a blackboard according to ASTM D 2255 standard. In the proposed method, a multi-scale attention model is proposed and developed, which can fully imitate human attention at different observation distances for the whole and detailed yarn information. A Spectral Residual method is then extended to establish a general benchmark for the comparison among different grade yarns. In the developed system, Fourier transform is employed to separate yarn diameter and hairs, and image conspicuity is obtained by the multi-scale attention model. Total sixteen features, obtained from yarn diameter, hairiness and image conspicuity, are extracted to present the yarn surface characteristics and then used to classify and grade yarn surface qualities using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Two kinds of PNNs, i. e. global and individual PNNs, and two types of classification, i. e. eight-grade and five-grade classifications, are designed and developed for various yarn quality classification purposes. For the evaluation of the proposed method, a database was constructed with 296 yarn board images, covering eight yarn counts (7 Ne~ 80 Ne) and different grades. Experimental results showed that the accuracy for eight-and five-grade global PNNs are 92. 23 % and 93. 58 %, respectively, demonstrating a good classification performance of the proposed digital method in yarn surface grading. Finally, with the above developed computer methods, two intelligent digital systems have been developed for the computerized analysis and evaluation of yarn internal structure and surface appearance, respectively. The systems were designed for controlling and visualizing the whole process of yarn measurement and analysis, covering image acquisition, image processing and data analysis with interactive and user-friendly interface. Both digital systems are potential for application in textile laboratories and spinning mills for yarn structure and surface analyses. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the advantages <b>of</b> analysing <b>yarn</b> evenness, based on mass variation, using a capacitive sensor {{which allows the}} measurement <b>of</b> 1 mm <b>yarn</b> length. The variation of capacity {{is due to the}} dielectric change and is proportional to the quantity <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> mass between the sensor plates. Available commercial equipment uses a solution of 8 mm with the drawback of decreasing the resolution eight times. This limits the correct detection of Neps and other parameters. This type of fault (Nep), usually has a length between 1 and 4 mm, which can be measured directly with the new sensor. Commercial equipment detects this fault based on estimation.

40|$|In this study, a {{geometrical}} model {{was introduced to}} improve the hair trapping via a surface contacting the yarn-twisting triangle during ring twisting <b>of</b> two single <b>yarns.</b> The fiber-trapping improvement with the contact surface was analyzed theoretically. Then, single Ne 80 ring cotton yarns were used to produce two-ply yarns under different ring-twisting conditions, namely conventional twisting, dry twisting <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> with a plane surface, wet twisting <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> with a plane surface, dry twisting <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> with a grooved surface, and wet twisting <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> with a grooved surface. Plied yarn properties, including yarn hairiness, strength, and irregularity, were tested. The Student Newman Keuls (SNK) test and variation analysis were also {{carried out in the}} SPSS program to study the effect of different contact surfaces on related yarn properties; the significance level was 0. 05 for the SNK test and variation <b>analysis.</b> The hairiness <b>of</b> plied <b>yarns</b> was significantly reduced when twisting with the plane or grooved surface, especially for the wet twisting cases. This corresponds well with our model on improving fiber trapping. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{computerized}} method {{has been proposed}} for automatic measurement and recognition <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> wet snarls from an image <b>of</b> snarled <b>yarn</b> samples captured in a water bath. After image acquisition, image conversion and individual snarled sample extraction, the yarn profile function was extracted from the separated binary image. Fast Fourier Transform and Adaptive Orientated Orthogonal Projective Decomposition were then incorporated into a pattern recognition algorithm <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl features by treating the yarn profile function as a one-dimensional signal. In addition to the number <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl turns, the method was also accurate and efficient for the detection <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl height and width, which are unobtainable by the untwisting method. The effects of various factors on the yarn profile function were numerically examined, including distributions <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> diameter and snarl, {{and the level of}} random noise.

40|$|Abstract. Yarn {{breaking}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common problems in textile weaving. Focus on this problem this paper proposed capacitance based detecting-circuit to sense the status <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> The sensor adopts a capacitance sensor to detect the yarn on weaving machine. The yarn breaking will lead the little change in electric capacity. To detect the yarn status, Design a 555 based frequency generator circuit with capacitance sensor as one of the input. The pulse generated form 555 circuit is transmitted to MCU, MCU <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> frequency changes to judge whether the yarn is broken and send relative control signals and location information <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> breakage to HMI...|$|R
40|$|It is {{actually}} for history of textile technologies and Lithuanian culture heritage to investigate deeply peculiarities of manufacturing and appearance of folk textile, to establish {{local and global}} tendencies of their distribution. This investigation seeks to discover alternation of home weaving traditions establishing raw material <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> structure and features of threads colours in authentic folk fabrics used in Lithuanian villages in the 19 th century in peasants clothing and showing yarns types territorial distribution in Lithuanian regions Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. It was investigated 468 pieces of clothing of this period from the album saved in National M. K. Čiurlionis Museum of Art. It is unexpected that cotton yarns are very common in warp of hand made clothing fabrics {{at the end of}} the 19 th century. Cotton yarns replaced flax and wool in warp. It was established that plied yarns dominate in warp and plain yarns – in weft. Fancy dyed, mouline, melange and yarns with multiplex winding were identificated in the fabrics. Also it was innovative to found the metallic thread in weft of two examples of the fabrics. Frequency of colours distribution was established analyzing colours <b>of</b> <b>yarns.</b> The <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> territorial distribution <b>of</b> fancy <b>yarns</b> types showed the tendency to spread the novelties <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> and threads in traditional textile from the West part of the country.
