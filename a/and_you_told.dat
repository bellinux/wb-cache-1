[...] Lamphere {{was arrested and charged}} with murder and arson. Then scores of investigators, sheriff's deputies, coroner's men and many volunteers began to search the ruins for evidence.|$|E

6000|$|... “I’m {{sure not}} great at talking,” Moran agreed. “Now, {{if he tried}} to have us sandbagged, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me to get after him—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have not. I {{can assure}} you that at the present moment there is no more of an {{understanding}} between me and the young man you so much disliked than between him <b>and</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>told</b> me to forget him; and I have forgotten him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you mean}} Sir Felix Carbury, {{it is about}} him. He has been to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{therefore}} I don't know why I need hold my tongue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How long is it,' asked Alice, 'since I went to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what I had done, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> {{were advised}} {{it was too}} late for anyone to follow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Susan; [...] "I {{remember}} his picture on your bureau at Sutcliffe. He {{had such a}} good face. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{thought that}} Beric was our friend, father, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me you {{had heard that}} he was {{teaching}} his countrymen how great is our history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort," [...] {{said the}} stout lady. [...] "I booked my seat on Monday, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me {{any of the}} front places were vacant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} have come," [...] she began. [...] "I {{could not be}} at peace with myself until I had seen <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how sorry I am for yesterday, and how deeply ashamed I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tita smiled. [...] "You {{would not}} like to lose that, eh? though you care little about losing me. <b>And</b> yet <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me that <b>you</b> loved me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTUS. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> the motor-car {{people to}} come here and arrange to start munition work now that their motor {{business}} is stopped? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me you didn't know--that I {{was to see}} for myself. We've {{said little}} about it since, even in so long a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What for?" [...] {{the girl}} asked, looking round in surprise. [...] "You {{live a long}} way from here, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me you knew nobody in these parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But the india-rubber water-bottle?' I put in. 'You {{have been}} deceiving Mrs. Evelegh. It blackens silver. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> her lies {{in order to}} extort money under false pretences.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mother, I did {{not come}} to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me nothing of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens! Collie ill <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never <b>told</b> me!" [...] cried Moore. [...] "I can't believe it. She's so {{healthy and}} strong. What ailed her, Bent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of my new assistant, Helen?" [...] asked Savine. [...] "You {{generally}} have a quick judgment, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> me yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to think quietly of it, my love, for your sake.--Well! well! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> him all that Anne Catherick had said to you--all that you told me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cos Jessie's {{going to}} have one, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me to be original," [...] and here the poor mite, {{reflecting}} upon the price her originality was going to cost her, burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} before he {{signed on with}} me," [...] said the captain, {{pointing}} a stumpy forefinger at him. [...] "I {{made a point of}} it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me that you had never heard anything against him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>and,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me, he {{is quite}} {{confident}} that I will keep faith with him; and so I will. I have had a letter from him since you saw him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} say if your sister, your real sister, asked advice in such a strait? If you had a sister, who came to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all her difficulty, you would advise her. You would not say words to make things worse for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew there}} was {{something}} forgotten," [...] she said. [...] "You have been all this time in the house, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me nothing. Begin directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you did. You told me as I {{was to come}} up to London when I saw you at Sheepstone Beeches;--didn't you? <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me {{you loved}} me;-- didn't you? And that if I wanted {{anything}} you'd get it done for me;-- didn't you?' ...|$|E
60|$|Here by the moorway you returned, And saw {{the borough}} lights ahead That lit your face--all undiscerned To be {{in a week}} {{the face of the}} dead, <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> of the charm of that haloed view That never again would beam on you.|$|E
6000|$|The king replied: 'Such {{knowledge}} {{would be}} of no benefit to you, for if I granted it to you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> any one of it, you would immediately die; ask me rather for whatever else you would most like to possess, and it shall be yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{bound to}} confess I did so, as {{otherwise}} I must confess myself a liar. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{at the time}} that I loved <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so truly. But it is better, ten times better, that those who love should part, even though they still should love, than that two should be joined together who are incapable of making each other happy. Remember what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} reflectively, [...] "I don't think you do. It doesn't matter who she is, anyway, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> me what <b>you</b> think of Mr. Sewell." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter Rabbit hopped up excitedly. [...] "You {{said that}} the largest animals in the world live in the sea, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> us what they are," [...] he cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{you will}} say, [...] "we {{have had this}} case before. You put a red counter into No. 5, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> us it meant 'some new Cakes are nice'; and NOW you tell us that it means 'some NICE Cakes are NEW'! Can it mean BOTH?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the woman}} came and {{threatened}} me in Vauxhall Walk," [...] he began, still {{staring into the}} fire, [...] "you {{came back to the}} parlor after she was gone, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me--?" [...] He stopped, shivered a little, and lost the thread of his recollections at that point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, do {{you suppose}} if I'd known where that first visit of ours to Waterlow {{was going to bring}} you out I'd have taken you within fifty miles--?" [...] He stopped suddenly; then in another tone: [...] "Jerusalem, there's no one like you! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> them it was all YOU?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, I {{thought as}} <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> me {{about all the}} beauty places in Thrums, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> ain't never <b>told</b> me about the Den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we agreed}} that, Gerald; {{but there was}} a limit, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> had spoken to Teddy Burke about it, and {{arranged}} the matter with him, I thought you had gone beyond that limit, altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] Poirot {{caught me}} violently by the shoulders. [...] "Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? <b>And</b> <b>you</b> never <b>told</b> me? Why {{did you not}} tell me? Why? Why?" ...|$|R
