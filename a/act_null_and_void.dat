50|$|The {{application}} of law 143/1947 remains disputable, because it contravenes the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, {{which was in}} force {{at the time of}} promulgation. Furthermore, an appeal against the previous confiscation under presidential decrees was pending, rendering any additional <b>act</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court {{declared}} the Fifth Amendment <b>Act</b> 1979 <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> It ruled that martial law was illegal and unconstitutional. Hence, all martial law proclamations were also illegal.|$|R

50|$|At {{the home}} of the Julii, Antony angrily threatens {{retribution}} on all Caesar's killers, as well as Vorenus for abandoning them; Atia reminds him that Servilia is {{the driving force behind the}} murders, and informs him that Vorenus was lured away. Antony advises Atia and her family to flee Rome with him to the north, where he can assemble an army to fall upon the Liberatores; however, they are stopped as they try to convince Caesar's widow, Calpurnia, who insists they must attend to Caesar's will. In it, Caesar has left a substantial sum of money to every citizen of Rome, frees Posca, and leaves his estate and title to Octavian, whom Caesar refers to as his son in the will. Knowing that he will get nothing if Brutus and his allies declare Caesar's death tyrannicide (which would make all of his <b>acts</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void),</b> Octavian convinces Antony and Atia to cut a deal with the assassins, since if Brutus and his allies do so, they also lose all the positions and power Caesar bestowed on them.|$|R
5000|$|The 1704 acts {{were highly}} controversial, and dissenters lobbied the English {{government}} and public for their repeal. Daniel Defoe wrote a pamphlet, [...] "Case of the Protestant Dissenters," [...] that {{set out the}} argument of the nonconformists. They argued that the Exclusion Act was contrary to colonial precedent and the Carolina charter. On the Establishment Act, they argued that it violated the Church of England's episcopal polity by giving lay commissioners powers to discipline clergy. The House of Lords agreed and Queen Anne declared the <b>acts</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> On November 30, 1706, the General Assembly repealed both acts. They were replaced by a new Establishment Act that eliminated the commission's ability to discipline clergy. However, parishioners still elected their clergy and the lay commission still administered elections and supervised the Church of England in Carolina. An 1710 amendment to the act abolished parish levies and instead provided that vestries could draw up to ₤40 annually from public funds to cover parish expenses. In this way, dissenters would not directly fund the Church of England.|$|R

5000|$|The Government of Uttar Pradesh filed a {{case against}} this {{production}} under the Drama Performance Act of 1876. In 1956 Justice Anandnarayan Mulla rejected the case {{on the grounds that}} it violated the right to expression granted by India's constitution and decided that the Drama Performance <b>Act</b> be declared <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> in independent India.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 April 2014, the Verkhovna Rada {{declared}} the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol {{to be under}} [...] "provisional occupation" [...] by the Russian military and imposed travel restrictions on Ukrainians visiting Crimea. The territories were also deemed [...] "inalienable parts of Ukraine" [...] subject to Ukrainian law. Among other things, the special law approved by the Rada restricted foreign citizens' movements {{to and from the}} Crimean Peninsula and forbade certain types of entrepreneurship. The law also forbade activity of government bodies formed in violation of Ukrainian law and designated their <b>acts</b> as <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> The law had little to no actual effect in Crimea itself due to the mutual non-recognition between Kiev and Simferopol.|$|R

If {{the said}} {{corporation}} shall not, {{within two years}} from the passage of this act, commence {{the construction of the}} said road, and expend at least the sum of five thousand dollars thereon, and shall not, within four year from the passage of this act, finish the said road, and put the same in operation, then the said corporation shall henceforth forever cease, and this <b>act</b> shall be <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 11 September 1963, just 4 {{days before}} the new Federation of Malaysia was to come into being, the Government of the State of Kelantan sought a {{declaration}} that the Malaysia Agreement <b>and</b> Malaysia <b>Act</b> were <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void,</b> or alternatively, {{that even if they}} were valid, they did not bind the State of Kelantan. The Kelantan Government argued that both the Malaysia Agreement and the Malaysia Act were not binding on Kelantan on the following grounds that the Malaysia Act in effect abolished the Federation of Malaya and this was contrary to the 1957 Federation of Malaya Agreement that the proposed changes required the consent of each of the constituent states of the Federation of Malaya - including Kelantan - and this had not been obtained.|$|R
25|$|The {{judgments}} {{of the court}} {{are based on the}} constitution, which is the supreme law of the land. They guarantee the basic rights and freedoms of all persons. They are binding on all organs of government, including the parliament, the presidency, the police force, the army, the public service and all courts. This means that the court has the power to declare an <b>Act</b> of Parliament <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> if it conflicts with the constitution and to control executive action in the same way.|$|R
5000|$|In most but not {{all modern}} states the {{constitution}} has supremacy over ordinary statutory law (see Uncodified constitution below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. {{it is not a}} power granted to the government by the constitution, that <b>act</b> is <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void,</b> <b>and</b> the nullification is ab initio, that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never [...] "law", even though, {{if it had been a}} statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the problem is not that a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional. Historically, the remedy for such violations have been petitions for common law writs, such as quo warranto.|$|R
5|$|This <b>Act</b> made <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 {{that had}} repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of}} the See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Act</b> makes <b>null,</b> <b>void,</b> <b>and</b> {{unenforceable}} any waiver of a {{right to}} claim a lien in advance of furnishing labor, services, or materials. Further, any lien waiver executed after commencement of a project, whether to induce a progress payment or final payment, must substantially follow the forms set forth in the Act. Within thirty days after entering into a lien waiver conditional on payment, an unpaid contractor must file an Affidavit of Nonpayment or else such amounts owed shall be deemed paid in full and the condition of payment satisfied...|$|R
50|$|Since the Commonwealth Government {{had become}} {{responsible}} for state debts in 1928 under {{an amendment to}} the Constitution, the new UAP government of Joseph Lyons paid the interest to the overseas bondholders, and then set about extracting the money from NSW by passing the Financial Agreement Enforcement Act 1932, which the High Court held to be valid. Lang then contended that the <b>Act</b> was rendered <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> by contravening the 1833 prohibition of slavery throughout the British Empire; the Premier held that the actions of the Lyons government deprived the State of New South Wales of paying the wages of State employees and that this necessarily constituted an (illegal) state of slavery.|$|R
50|$|The {{matter was}} {{referred}} to the Constitutional Court by the High Court for confirmation of its order declaring {{the decision of the}} President to bring the <b>Act</b> into force <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> The Constitutional Court, in a unanimous decision delivered by Chaskalson P, confirmed the order of the Transvaal High Court, but gave reasons that were {{different from those of the}} High Court. Two issues had to be decided by the Court. The first was whether or not the High Court’s order, setting aside the President’s decision, was a finding of “constitutional invalidity” that required confirmation by the Constitutional Court under section 172(2) of the Constitution. If so, the second issue was whether the President’s decision to bring the Act into force was constitutionally valid or not.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{explanation}} and introduction of a specific legal doctrine; Ultra Vires. In addition, this paper will illustrate how the methodology was applied under the United Kingdom company law from the mid- 19 th century to 2009. Furthermore, this paper will offer a brief analysis of British law after {{the abolition of the}} Ultra Vires doctrine. Ultra Vires is a set of rules that limits the legal capacity of companies. As a result, the company's legal capacity was limited while the doctrine was applied. The scope and capacity of a company was defined by the objects clause contained in the memorandum of association. From this, it was deduced that an act done by the company outside its objects clause (an ultra vires <b>act)</b> was <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Considering that the legal capacity of companies in the Czech legal system is unlimited and that there are no research papers dedicated to companies with limited capacity in the Czech language, the {{aim of this}} thesis is to provide it. The thesis is divided into six chapters: Introduction; Introduction to the Doctrine of Ultra Vires; Formation of the Doctrine of Ultra Vires; Development of the Doctrine of Ultra Vires; Abolition of the Doctrine of Ultra Vires and a Conclusion. The Introduction is dedicated to the explanation of the legal [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the development from abstract to causal juridical acts and explains the abstract legal effect of juridical acts in present-day European civil law (in the law of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France). He concludes that in contemporary law juridical acts cannot have full abstract legal effect, as in archaic legal orders, because modern legal orders do not allow the creation of claims and debts in a way that entirely excludes the possibility to scrutinize whether a juridical <b>act</b> is <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> for the infringement of public order by its aim. In relation to the law of Serbia, the author refers to the difference between juridical acts that create obligations, that is claims and debts, and acts by which the parties merely dispose of the claims and debts already imposed. This division of juridical acts has its origins in the German legal culture, but it is fairly applicable to the Serbian law, as well. The author points out that the requirement of the Law on obligations, that all juridical acts must have a valid cause, applies without exception to juridical acts imposing an obligation (the so-called Verpflichtungsgeschäfte), regardless of whether they are concluded {{in the form of an}} abstract of causal act, i. e. whether the purpose of the transaction is determinable from their content. In this context he refers to the standpoint adopted in the doctrine that the cause of juridical acts gains relevance by three means: by the agreement of the parties, objection of the respondent and when the court determines ex officio whether the contract is contrary to public order. The author supports the point of view that in Serbian law juridical acts aimed merely to disposing of claims and debts already imposed (the so-called Verfügungsgeschäfte) may have a legal effect, which is independent from their cause. For these reasons, the author is of the opinion that in present-day legal orders, hence in Serbian law too, it is more appropriate to use the phrase 'abstract legal effect of a juridical act', which refers to a legal effect of an act, whereby the relevance of its cause is reduced or even eliminated, instead of the collocation 'abstract juridical act', which connotes a specific type of juridical act, one entirely independent from its cause...|$|R
