5|$|By 1015, Bulgaria {{had been}} embroiled in <b>almost</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> {{of war with}} the Byzantine Empire, and Gavril Radomir had succeeded Samuel, who died on 6 October 1014 after the {{disastrous}} Battle of Kleidion. However, from the outset Radomir's position was insecure: Ivan Vladislav, as a son of the elder of the Cometopouli brothers, could lay claim on the throne based on seniority. During that time the Byzantine Emperor Basil II campaigned deep into Bulgarian territory. He retook the previously lost town of Voden (Edessa) and laid siege to the massive fortress of Maglen, situated to the north-west. Gavril Radomir {{did not have enough}} forces and was unable to interfere and could only watch the course of the events from the nearby Lake Ostrovo. His inability to cope with the Byzantine threat aroused discontent among the nobility and Ivan Vladislav became their chosen leader. The fall of Maglen sealed Gavril Radomir's fate—in the late summer of 1015, while hunting near Ostrovo (Arnissa), he was murdered by his cousin, perhaps at the behest of Byzantine agents. Ivan Vladislav then seized the Bulgarian throne and took steps to ensure his position against potential rivals.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after <b>almost</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done <b>almost</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E

40|$|AT 313, The Girl as Helper in the Hero’s Flight, {{amongst the}} longest of Märchen, is also rich with complex symbolism, and requires, for a {{comprehensive}} interpretation, a much fuller treatment than can be adequately contained within the prescribed twenty minutes.

The second part of my title AT 313, The Maid as Mentor in the Young Man’s Maturation aptly summarizes what I feel would be an appropriate renaming of the tale type, if such a renaming were based uniquely on versions of the tale I or my students have collected from French Newfoundlanders over an <b>almost</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>year</b> period, and if, more pertinently, there was sufficient scholarly agreement on the meaning and function of the tale. In focussing on female sexuality in the tale, however, I wish to stress not only its centrality to an understanding of the tale’s meaning, but also the crucial significance of the relationship between tale interpretation and what Bengt Holbek called “the storytelling community. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction According {{to general}} {{relativity}} {{any change in}} the gravitational field of a compact gravitating system like neutron star or black hole, will produce a ripple on the spacetime which will propagate with the speed of light. This is a gravitational wave. Although gravitational waves have been predicted from the very early days of general relativity they have not yet been detected directly. Nevertheless, their indirect influence on the evolution of compact binary systems has been observed almost 20 years ago, and the observational results agree to remarkable accuracy with the theoretical predictions. <b>Almost</b> <b>thirty</b> five <b>years</b> ago attempts were made to detect these tiny ripples in the spacetime by constructing gravitational wave detectors in the form of resonant bars. Today these detectors are either narrowband resonant bars or spheres or broadband laser interferometers. The resonant detectors are already in operation and they have achieved sensitivitie...|$|R
