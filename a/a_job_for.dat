5|$|After his {{athletic}} career, Thorpe struggled {{to provide for}} his family. He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> an extended period of time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E
5|$|South Melbourne and the VFL {{objected to}} the {{transfer}} and South Melbourne sent out a public appeal for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> Nash that would match that offered by Camberwell but nothing suitable was forthcoming. There were also threats of legal action against Nash and Camberwell, which did not eventuate, although for playing in another competition without a clearance, Nash was banned from playing in the VFL competition for three years – a suspension which meant {{he would have to}} sit out of all football (both VFA and VFL) for three years if he wished to return from the VFA to the VFL.|$|E

Woolfolk noted that he was offered under-the-table payments by agents {{while he was still}} in school, as well as cars, and even <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> his stepfather, William Johnson, a Newark dockworker. Woolfolk turned down those offers and signed with Jerry Argovitz.|$|E

5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> a significant length of time.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|He {{graduated}} from university in 1935, but {{upon his return}} to Sweden, he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Later that year, his grandfather arranged <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> him in Cape Town, South Africa, {{in the office of}} a Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in Haifa. He returned to Sweden in 1936 and obtained a job in Stockholm {{with the help of his}} uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company, an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by Kálmán Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.|$|E

However, when Becca's boyfriend, Tim (Christopher Nicholas Smith), comes to the 30 Rock building, Liz realizes that Becca and Tim should be together so that they can raise their child together, and tells them to make their relationship work.|$|E
5|$|Manning was incensed {{that the}} British Council did not {{immediately}} find <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> Reggie, whom she considered {{one of their most}} brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the Council's representative, C.F.A. Dundas, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in Fortunes of War. Manning's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on Lord Dunsany, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists, poets and writers in Cairo, paid so little attention to her and Reggie; she later took revenge in a similar way.|$|E
