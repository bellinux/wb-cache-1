50|$|In the {{majority}} of manufacturing applications for <b>air</b> <b>knives,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> are stationary while the product passes through the air velocity air stream. In other circumstances, the product is stationary and the <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> move (reciprocate or rotate) {{over the surface of}} the stationary product. Although there are very few applications where an air knife can actually cut a product (break mechanical bonds between two points), <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> are often the most efficient method of removing or controlling unwanted or foreign substances on any surface.|$|E
50|$|There {{has always}} been a wide {{assortment}} of blow-off appliances. <b>Air</b> <b>knives</b> and nozzles for compressed air blow-off range from home made round pipes with holes to engineered high pressure <b>air</b> <b>knives.</b> In order to achieve the highest efficiency using compressed air, many manufacturers of compressed <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> utilize the Coandă effect to improve compressed air knife design over other types of knives and nozzles. Although the efficiency of compressed air for low-pressure blow-off air is much lower than blowers, the Coanda-inspired <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> entrain ambient air into the high-velocity stream to enhance the blow off effect.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents numerical {{investigations into}} some aspects affecting {{the formation of}} dross during continuous galvanizing. It {{is well known that}} dross formation depends on the bath composition, temperature and flow dynamics. However, experimental observation indicates that top dross formation is affected by oxidation at the surface of the bath as the use of an inert gas in <b>air</b> <b>knifes</b> greatly reduces dross generation. In this work numerical simulations are used to investigate the flow dynamics of the gas {{in the vicinity of the}} bath surface in order to obtain correlations between the gas velocity and the propensity for oxidation and dross formation. Simulations are first shown for a bench scale experiment simulating top dross formation for which experimental data are available. The experiment consists of a crucible containing liquid zinc with various aluminum and iron contents. The flow in the crucible is generated by the rotation of a propeller immersed into the liquid zinc and then air or inert gas is projected to the surface of the liquid metal to determine the effect on oxidation and dross formation. Dross formation is then correlated to the size of the exposed surface and to the relative velocity between the liquid zinc and the gas. Numerical results are also shown for the gas flow dynamics inside <b>air</b> <b>knifes</b> and in the vicinity of the bath surface. This provides a map of the relative gas/liquid velocity at bath surface which then can be used to estimate the propensity for oxidation and top dross formation.

50|$|The {{most common}} use of <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> is to contain or remove {{free-standing}} materials (liquids or solids) {{from the surface}} of material. The applications include drying bottles and cans after filling and rinsing, printed circuit boards following the conveyorized wash to remove solder paste and flux, metals castings after automatic machining and many more. They can also deliver heated or cooled air to a surface, or create an invisible air barrier to separate heated or cooled environments from one another in industrial applications such as continuous metal heat treating ovens, cold process or storage areas in food processing or dust containment for the entrance to clean rooms.|$|E

50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with {{hot dip galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|E

5000|$|Air knife designs {{today have}} evolved to where some {{manufacturers}} produce a very efficient “teardrop” shape with a [...]95 coefficient of discharge. These blower-powered air knife designs typically have a profile of approximately 3.5 in wide x 5.5 in tall x any length, but the teardrop profile can range from 1.5 to 10 in tall depending on the criteria of the product for which the impact air velocity must be engineered. With construction ranging from 1/8 in thick aluminum extrusion to 11 gauge fabricated stainless steel, <b>air</b> <b>knives</b> can weigh 1 lb/ft to 25 lbs/ft. Depending on the width and speed of the product, the air knife can provide effective blow-off performance from 0.5 to 12 in or more away {{from the surface of}} the product.

A jet of either nitrogen or air was directed on to the bath liquid surface simulating the flow from the <b>air</b> <b>knives.</b> The rate of skimmings generated for variable rotational speeds was measured for zinc compositions corresponding to GA and GI operations. Moreover, a numerical simulation of liquid zinc flow in the crucible was carried out to determine the surface area of the liquid zinc free surface exposed to the gas stream. This calculation was used to determine the rate of skimmings generated per unit surface area for each rotational speed. It was found that the rate of skimmings generated increased with surface velocity and the rate using nitrogen was lower than for air. Furthermore, dross particles imbedded in the skimmings from both laboratory and industrial samples were similar in morphology and composition. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|CSIRO/Novatech Consulting {{have been}} {{developing}} air purging {{as a new}} way of reducing the moisture content of coarse coal products from vibrating basket centrifuges. The process involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air, via an <b>air</b> <b>knife</b> manifold, through the coal bed as it traverses the centrifuge basket. This paper describes the results obtained when the process was trialled in a commercial scale centrifuge, following successful previous bench and pilot scale work reported previously. Five manifolds of different shapes and sizes were tested. The best results were achieved with units of square cross-section, located close to the outlet edge of the basket. Depending on air speed, product moisture was reduced by between 0. 7 and 0. 9 wt% at a confidence level exceeding 95 %. The best results approached closely the 1. 0 wt% moisture reduction target which had been adopted as the project objective. Air purging had no significant effect on the content or size distribution of the solids in the centrate. Increasing air speed led to larger moisture reductions. Higher air speeds were needed compared with previous pilot scale work probably due to the thicker beds encountered in the full scale centrifuge. Despite the higher air speed, the actual air usage (cfm/t of coal) was much more efficient at full scale, being less than half that at pilot scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
