5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, but found {{that no one was}} certain of Jennings's role in the commission. After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|Fireforce was {{a variant}} on the {{vertical}} envelopment tactic in which ground {{troops would be}} carried directly to the target by air <b>and</b> <b>dropped.</b> <b>It</b> was designed to react instantly to guerrilla ambushes, farm attacks and sightings, and could also be called upon {{by members of the}} security forces as reinforcements. Preparatory deployment was very flexible: all that was required for a base was an airstrip. There would usually be three main Fireforces in operation at each time, each of which would be handled by a company-sized body of men, usually one of the RLI Commandos or a company of the Rhodesian African Rifles. The unit in question would be posted at a forward airfield for six weeks (though sometimes for longer) and given responsibility for thousands of square kilometres of Rhodesian countryside. The Selous Scouts' hidden forward observation posts (OPs) allowed for instant reactions by Fireforce to sightings of the enemy guerrillas.|$|E

He regained the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship (formerly called the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship) by defeating Roddy Piper on May 10, 1982. He dropped the title back to Piper on July 7 and regained it in August. After his matches with Piper, Brisco traded the title {{back and forth}} with Paul Jones several times.

25|$|ENDA {{has been}} {{introduced}} in every Congress since 1994 except the 109th. Similar legislation {{has been introduced}} without passage since 1974. The bill gained its best chance at passing after the Democratic Party gained the majority after twelve years of Republican majorities in the 2006 midterm elections. In 2007, gender identity protections {{were added to the}} legislation for the first time. Some sponsors believed that even with a Democratic majority, ENDA did not have enough votes to pass the House of Representatives with transgender inclusion <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> from the bill, which passed the House and then died in the Senate. President George W. Bush threatened to veto the measure. LGBT advocacy organizations and the LGBT community were divided over support of the modified bill.|$|E
25|$|Although Williams {{attracted}} the attention and admiration {{of some of the}} most notable writers of his day, including T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, his greatest admirer was probably C. S. Lewis, whose novel That Hideous Strength (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study The Allegory of Love; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.|$|E

During this innings, watched by {{a crowd of}} 20,000, Flintoff hit a six into the top tier of the Ryder Stand. A man stood to claim the catch <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> – it was Flintoff's father. Over the course of England's record-breaking summer, he hit a half-century in all seven victorious Tests against New Zealand and the West Indies. On returning to the one-day game as an all-rounder in September he fell agonisingly short of a third one-day century, caught on 99 against India, though {{he went on to}} hit a further century in the ICC Champions Trophy pool match against Sri Lanka two weeks later.|$|E

25|$|After the 2009 season, Corp {{transferred}} to Richmond, and after off-season practices, Mustain became Barkley's back-up for the 2010 season. Before the season, Mustain was diagnosed and started treatment for {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and head coach Pete Carroll left to coach in the NFL and was replaced by Lane Kiffin, who stuck with Barkley as the starter. Mustain proceeded to back up Barkley until Barkley was injured in the next-to-last game of the season, allowing Mustain to start his first football game since playing at Arkansas in 2006. Starting in the Notre Dame rivalry game, Mustain put up 21-for-38 passes for 183 yards with one interception in a game that became known for a pass that was dropped: In the final two minutes of the game, Mustain threw an accurate pass to a wide-open Ronald Johnson that would have resulted in a touchdown and the probable win, but Johnson bobbled the ball <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it.</b> Moments after the drop, Mustain threw his only interception of the game to seal the loss.|$|E
25|$|In early April as the Allied {{forces and}} notably the French Army {{advanced}} toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders {{to destroy the}} electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but citizens succeeded in persuading the staff sergeant {{in charge of the}} operation to refrain from this absurd endeavor {{in the face of the}} imminent and inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Weißenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the fuze wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> into Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an armored vehicle unit) moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German infantry unit using artillery. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an Algerian and Moroccan unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the Volkssturm) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud residential town of the Baden Margraves.|$|E

500|$|Reaching {{the grand}} final meant {{defeating}} the axe-wielding robot Terrorhurtz. Razer avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz {{lined up for}} another strike, but Razer slid its wedge underneath Terrorhurtz's chassis. It buried the arm into its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit release button, <b>and</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> into the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. After twice losing to Razer that year, the developers of Tornado had constructed a large metal frame equipped with a rotating blade. Controversially qualifying as an [...] "interchangeable weapon", {{the size of this}} framework prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a lifting hook {{to the front of the}} arm before the fight. Although Razer would still not be able to pierce Tornado, it could lift it by the framework. In the battle, Tornado used its superior pushing power to slam Razer into the arena wall and the house robots. Near the end of the fight, Razer managed to lift Tornado up and push it over the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in. After a 45 minute discussion, the judges ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to popular}} story, {{one day he}} came home early and {{surprised}} his wife who was reading. She put her book {{down on top of}} a bird cage and ran to meet him.

[...] Jenney applied his new idea to the construction of the Home Insurance Building, the first skyscraper in the world, which was erected in 1884 at the corner of LaSalle and Monroe Streets in Chicago. Another source cites the inspiration for the steel skyscraper as coming from vernacular Philippine architecture, where wooden framed construction gave Jenney the idea. The Home Insurance Building was the first example of a steel skeleton building, the first grid of iron columns, girders, beams and floor joists ever constructed.|$|E
