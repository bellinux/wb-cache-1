The original Sledgehammer document containing the coup plans, allegedly written in 2003, {{was found to have}} been written using Microsoft Word 2007. Despite both domestic and international calls for these irregularities to be <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> guarantee a fair trial, Erdoğan instead praised his government for bringing the coup plots to light. When Gülen publicly withdrew support and openly attacked Erdoğan in late 2013, several imprisoned military officers and journalists were released, with the government admitting that the judicial proceedings were unfair.|$|E
25|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{strategy}} {{is to increase the}} modal share of the bicycle to 50% of commuter trips, and make Copenhagen the best cycling city in the world. The city has used the biennial bicycle accounts to identify key problems that need to be <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> increase the modal share, and plans employing a number of tools to reach its target. These include widening cycle tracks to 3 lanes to allow for conversational cycling and increase the sense of safety on the cycle tracks, {{while at the same time}} allowing for higher speeds among commuters. The city further plans to decrease travel times by expanding the use of green waves adjusted to cycling speeds, and building additional bicycle and pedestrian only bridges across busy streets and over the harbour and canals. The city also plans to increase safety by redesigning a number of intersections with a high number of accidents, and rebuilding school routes with safer infrastructure, and speed decreasing measures. Finally the strategy also aims to improve the chaotic bicycle parking conditions, by greatly expanding the number of parking spaces, especially in and around stations.|$|E
500|$|Routine decrees (ferman) or {{titles of}} {{privilege}} (berat) {{were written by}} a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ı hümayun) or Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun (hatt-ı hümayun to the title). The note might use a clichéd phrase like [...] "to be done as required" [...] (mûcebince amel oluna) or, [...] "my command is to carried out as required {{and no one is}} to interfere with its execution" [...] (emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was <b>addressed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as [...] "if you want to keep your head, carry out this order as required" [...] (Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna).|$|E

50|$|Also, {{one might}} argue that too narrow a focus on the {{challenges}} of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, “the past must be <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> reach the future”. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.|$|E
