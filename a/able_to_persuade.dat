R. Hamilton, Alexander the Great, 48. The Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, financed by Darius III of Persia, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement. Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, {{felt that the}} purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Smith to remain.|$|E

Children who had been abused,or were lost or sick called the hot-line and Childline sent help. She showed a fierce dedication and determination, stopping at nothing until the organisations had grown immensely. From 1996 to 2002 when Jeroo retired, Childline received 2.7 million calls. It wasn't always easy; in fact, in 1999 Childline was no longer receiving funding from the government and was almost shut down, through sheer perseverance Jeroo was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> turn to some wealthy individuals, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>persuade</b> the government <b>to</b> choose a board of directors who were strongly connected with Childline, resulting in most of their success. Jeroo was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> connect with the local police force and hospitals.

This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant.

Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the New Hampshire primary by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

Algiers was handed over to the Americans, French troops were confined to barracks but retained their weapons, and French police maintained law and order. French resistance to the Allies continued elsewhere in North Africa until Darlan issued a ceasefire on 10 November, and directed Juin to order French forces in Tunisia to resist the Germans and the Italians.

50|$|Physically a late bloomer, coaches {{initially}} {{hesitated to}} put him in the running back role that he desired. When his family moved to the suburb of Coppell, Texas, Coppell High School already had a highly regarded senior running back, {{one of the best in}} school history, and asked the sophomore Moody to spend a season at wide receiver. After insistence by himself and his uncle, Moody was allowed to play running back at the junior varsity level. During that time, Moody grew taller and put on 25 pounds. His junior season saw him rise to the varsity team where he finished the season with 1,319 yards and 12 touchdowns. His abilities attracted interest from a number of prominent college football programs, notably Texas, Miami and Southern California. Moody originally verbally committed to Texas, but USC linebacker coach Ken Norton was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>persuade</b> Moody <b>to</b> change his commitment to the Trojans, enticing him to the challenge of competing against a number of other talented running backs.|$|R
50|$|By 1913 the Pointe-Claire Boating Club {{was large}} enough to host the Eastern Division Regatta of the Canadian Canoe Association for the first time. The fact that the Boating club was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach such a size managed to help it survive through World War I. When the summer of 1914 arrived the club {{suffered}} a substantial decrease in members due to the war. They were forced to abandon expansion plans that they had and simply focus on keeping the club open by holding fundraisers. When the end of war finally came many returned to the club enthusiastically looking to improve the club and as well as community life. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>persuade</b> the Grand Trunk Railway to sell them {{the east side of}} the pier, and renamed themselves the Pointe-Claire Yacht Club.The same threat of closure was faced in World War II by the club when many of the members went off to war or simply did not have the leisure to be a part of a yacht club anymore, but the Pointe-Claire Yacht Club prevailed once again. While other such boating clubs like the Valois Boating Club and the Lakeside Boating club went under, the Pointe-Claire Yacht Club was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> survive and undergo expansion after the war.|$|R

To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks.

5|$|In July 1933, Parsons became {{liaison officer}} between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed {{by the head}} of its Radio Division, A. Hoyt Taylor, who told him about {{experiments}} that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name radar. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he realized {{that he was going to}} need high frequency microwaves. He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> the scientists to establish a group to investigate microwave radar, but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research.

5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E

In his book Sex, Lies and Headlocks, ESPN writer Shaun Assael stated that Canadian chemist Mauro Di Pasquale, who had been hired in June to monitor the WWF's new drug testing program and was known for being tough towards anyone who failed a drug test, nailed Warrior for steroid use in September and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>persuade</b> McMahon, who was under federal scrutiny at the time for allegations of illegally supplying steroids {{to some of his}} wrestlers, to release Warrior from the company.
