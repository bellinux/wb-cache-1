The levels of tissue ROS and serum inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>mice</b> compared to control mice, and knocking down PGC- 1 α drastically increased cytokine levels in both control and SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>mice.</b> Muscle fibrosis was much severer in SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>mice,</b> and worsened by silencing PGC- 1 α and attenuate d by TZD.

Serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin E and immunoglobulin G 1 titers in the OVA-orally sensitized W/WV and B 10 <b>A</b> <b>mice</b> ad libitium fed ACT were extremely inhibited compared to those of the control.

The proportions of the TCRγδ-T cells in the IEL of the OVA-orally sensitized W/WV and B 10 <b>A</b> <b>mice</b> ad libitium fed ACT were significantly greater than that in the controls. Furthermore, ACT feeding by itself could induce the rise in the percentage of the TCRγδ-T cells among the IEL of the W/WV and B 10 <b>A</b> <b>mice.</b> This suggests that the ACT intake may prevent the development of food allergies and this effect could be correlated with the rise in the percentage of TCRγδ-T cells among the IEL...|$|R
