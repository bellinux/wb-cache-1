Airspace management is planned {{to move away from}} the previous domination by national boundaries to the use of 'functional airspace blocks' the boundaries of which will be designed to maximise the efficiency of the airspace. Within the airspace, air traffic management, while continuing to have safety as its primary objective, will also be driven by the requirements of the <b>airspace</b> <b>user</b> and the need to provide for increasing air traffic.

The strategy relies on subliminal speed control. Owing {{to the complexity of}} this kind of optimisation problem, a simulated annealing metaheuristic approach is employed. A scenario with four hours of traffic overflying the Spanish (structured, continental) airspace has been selected. Traffic has been retrieved from NEST Eurocontrol database with the corresponding wind ensemble probabilistic forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Due to uncertainties and to the little range of speed changing allowed by a subliminal control, it becomes not possible to resolve all conflicts.

40|$|Continued {{growth and}} {{expansion}} of air traffic and increased air carrier economic pressures have mandated greater flexibility and collaboration in air traffic management. The ability of airspace users to select their own routes, so called "free-flight", and to more actively manage their fleet operations for maximum economic advantage are receiving great attention. A first step toward greater <b>airspace</b> <b>user</b> and service provider collaboration is information sharing. In this work, arrival scheduling and airspace management data generated by the NASA/FAA Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS) and used by the FAA service provider is shared with an airline with extensive operations within the CTAS operational domain. The design and development of a specialized airline CTAS "repeater" system is described, {{as well as some}} preliminary results of the impact and benefits of this information on the air carrier's operations. FAA controller per aircraft scheduling information, such as that provided by CTAS, has never before been shared in real-time with an airline.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the SATURN (Strategic Allocation of Traffic Using Redistribution in the Network) project is to make novel and credible use of market-based demand-management mechanisms to redistribute air traffic in the European airspace. This reduces congestion and saves the <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> operational costs. The project is motivated by frequent demand and capacity imbalances in the European airspace network, which are forecast {{to continue in the}} near future. The present and foreseen ways of dealing with such imbalances mainly concern strategic and tactical capacity-side interventions, such as resectorisation and opening of more sectors to deal with excess demand. These are followed by tactical demand management measures, if needed. As a result, not only do substantial costs arise, but <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> are also typically left with no choice but to comply with imposed air traffic flow management measures. The project shows how economic signals could be given to <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to improve capacity-demand balancing, airspace design and usage, and what the benefits would be of a centralised planner compared with those of decentralised maximisation of self interests (by the ANSPs and/or <b>airspace</b> <b>users)</b> ...|$|R

TA trajectories are optimised for each aircraft to permit a fuel-efficient, low-noise descent profile that will provide separation assistance while complying with arrival sequencing requirements and other airspace constraints. With airline partnership and FAA support, NASA Ames and Boeing have recently embarked on a collaborative R&D effort aimed at TA concept exploration and system validation in the U. S. This effort will initially focus on trans-oceanic arrival operations due to the availability of airborne and ground-based data-link support infrastructure present in the oceanic control environment.

40|$|The modern {{aeronautical}} scenario has {{welcomed the}} massive diffusion of new key elements, including the Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), initially used {{for military purposes}} only. The current decade has seen RPAS ready to become a new <b>airspace</b> <b>user</b> in a large variety of civilian applications. Although RPAS can currently only be flown into segregated airspaces, due to national and international Flight Aviation Authorities′ (FAAs) constraints, they represent a remarkable potential growth in terms of development and economic investments for aviation. Full RPAS development will only happen when flight into non‐segregated airspaces is authorized, as for manned civil and military aircraft. The preliminary requirement for disclosing the airspace to RPAS is the implementation of an ad hoc Safety Management System (SMS), as prescribed by ICAO, for every aeronautical operator.

40|$|While en route, aircrews submit {{trajectory}} change {{requests to}} {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to better meet their objectives including reduced delays, reduced fuel burn, and passenger comfort. Aircrew requests are currently made with limited to no information on surrounding traffic. Consequently, these requests are uninformed about a key ATC objective, ensuring traffic separation, and therefore {{less likely to be}} accepted than requests informed by surrounding traffic and that avoids creating conflicts. This paper studies the benefits of providing aircrews with on-board decision support to generate optimized trajectory requests that are probed and cleared of known separation violations prior to issuing the request to ATC. These informed requests are referred to as traffic aware strategic aircrew requests (TASAR) and leverage traffic surveillance information available through Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) In capability. Preliminary fast-time simulation results show increased benefits with longer stage lengths since beneficial trajectory changes can be applied over a longer distance. Also, larger benefits were experienced between large hub airports as compared to other airport sizes. On average, an aircraft equipped with TASAR reduced its travel time by about one to four minutes per operation and fuel burn by about 50 to 550 lbs per operation depending on the objective of the aircrew (time, fuel, or weighted combination of time and fuel), class of <b>airspace</b> <b>user,</b> and aircraft type.

40|$|This {{report is}} an update and {{extension}} of work published in 2004, also {{produced by the}} University of Westminster. This new report takes into account, as far as possible, relevant changes in the economic and regulatory environment since the earlier work. Whilst account has also been taken of the limited literature since 2004, the authors {{are not aware of}} any other new work comprehensively addressing European airline delay costs. Cost comparisons between the values reported earlier and the 2010 values are in unadjusted Euros, unless stated otherwise. The report is designed as a reference document for European delay costs incurred by airlines, both at the strategic (planning) and tactical stages. Quantifying these costs is essential to the objectives of SESAR, offering future solutions to the <b>airspace</b> <b>user,</b> which are focused on the “best business outcome”?. It includes extensive tabulations of costs and guidelines on how to use them. The results may be used by airline operators to gain operationally meaningful insights into typical European delay costs, a pre-requisite of delay cost management, including trade-offs between delays in different phases of flight (e. g. en-route and at-gate) and for a range of specific aircraft types and cost scenarios, reflecting different airline cost bases. The results may equally be used by policy makers and airspace managers and designers to quantify the benefits of improved service delivery (such as more direct routes, fewer aircraft delays at-gate, etc.). Assigning these costs is complex and draws {{on a wide range of}} disciplines, with relatively little published elsewhere with regards to quantifying European costs. A number of the costs modelled necessarily draw on expert judgement and assumptions, based on published statistics and robust data wherever possible.

Nevertheless, as with any such research, some caution is indicated in the use of the findings: such limitations and the need for further work are identified in the text...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of the concepts of fairness and equity in Air Traffic Management (ATM), specifically focusing on trajectory-based operations. One of the main objectives of these new type of operations, which are {{at the core of the}} two major ongoing ATM modernisation initiatives (SESAR in Europe and NextGen in the United States), is to enable Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to better accommodate the trajectories preferred by the different airspace users. In this context, it is pivotal to ensure that all airspace users are dealt with impartially by the ANSP responsible for monitoring, adjusting and clearing their trajectories. Thus, fairness and equity considerations need to be integrated in the definition and implementation of trajectory-based operations. In view of the lack of a rigorous approach to the integration of the concepts of fairness and equity in trajectory-based operations, this thesis proposes fairness and equity metrics to assess the impact of the decisions of ANSPs on the distribution of cost penalties among different users. In this context, a cost penalty is defined as the increment in operational cost for the user that results from being cleared to fly a trajectory that is different from its preferred one. In addition, this thesis proposes methods to incorporate the aforementioned metrics to the decision-making process of ANSPs in the context of trajectory-base operations, so that the trajectories assigned to the users may be fair to all of them. In a first step, this dissertation derives specifically for ATM the concepts of justice, fairness and equity from traditional disciplines such as Philosophy, Economics or Sociology. These theoretical notions are the foundations for developing the mathematical expressions to obtain quantitative values of fairness and equity in the context of future trajectory-based operations. These fairness and equity metrics are initially defined considering that each flight is an independent <b>airspace</b> <b>user</b> and later generalised to the possibility of airspace users simultaneously operating several flights in the same operational context, e. g. a scenario including several airlines where each one is operating several flights. Secondly, the practical application and incorporation of the developed metrics into the existing ATM systems is explored. Two different methodologies to apply the proposed fairness and equity metrics in practice are presented, each one addressing a specific example where using such metrics could benefit future trajectory-based operations. Specifically, the proposed methodologies deal with how to incorporate fairness and equity considerations in the design and evaluation of so-called trajectory management algorithms, which will be used by future ATM systems to adjust the airspace users’ preferred trajectories so that they remain conflict-free within a given time frame, e. g. during the arrival phase. The usability of the metrics according to the proposed methodologies is illustrated by means of specific and ATM-relevant examples. On the one hand, the integration of the fairness metric into a trajectory conflict resolution algorithm is presented with a view to enlarge the optimisation criteria of trajectory modifications, i. e. inclusion of fairness considerations during trajectory adjustments. On the other, a comparative assessment is described with regard to fairness and equity of three different conflict resolution algorithms for a given environment, i. e. operational context, route network and traffic situation. To complement the above, a preliminary robustness analysis of the proposed fairness and equity metrics has been conducted. This analysis is an important part of this work, addressing explicitly the need of particular characteristics in the ATM environment for successfully making use of fairness and equity metrics, identifying situations that can affect the effective application of metrics and establishing the provisions to guarantee it. This study is based on concepts from the field of Decision Theory where the ATM system is modelled to reflect the de-confliction of trajectories based on user preferences in a two-player game with a fairness-oriented ANSP. In summary, this thesis proposes a new framework to incorporate fairness and equity in future air traffic operations based on quantitative metrics. The framework includes methodologies to apply these metrics in practice with a view to enabling the fair or equitable distribution of cost penalties among users in trajectory-based operations...|$|E

40|$|This final degree project {{analyses}} {{the economic}} effects and the en-route charges difference billed to the <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> when using directs instead of conventional routing, concretely {{focusing on the}} cross-border operations. This analysis assesses the traffic data of the flights performed in the European Airspace during February and March of 2016 {{by means of the}} software NEST. The main purpose that is pursued is to find out the benefits that would be obtained by changing the current situation, where most directs are done under air traffic controller clearance, to a full implementation of the directs in the routes network which would enable the <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> introduce these operations in their flightplans. The main tasks of the project accomplished to achieve the objective are fundamentally two. On the one hand, find and evaluate several cross-border directs frequently performed, and compute the savings that would suppose its publication in the airspace charts. On the other hand, from some of these cases, the ones that involve more savings, make a formal proposal of implementation, bearing in mind all the necessary requirements that their introduction have to fulfill. Regarding the conclusions of the work, it has been confirmed some aspects already expected, like the huge amount of directs that are performed everyday along the European Airspace. However, the main issue is that most of them are not published in the route network. This situation, and specially when performing cross-border directs, implies an unnecessary increase of the air traffic controllers workload which could endanger the safety of the operations. Moreover, it has been found that the publication of cross-border directs would imply in most of the cases a reduction in en-route charges which would be beneficial for <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> but detrimental for the air navigation service providers. Finally, aiming to modernize the European airspace and with this increase the economic benefits of all the stakeholders, it is proposed an impartial solution.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the negotiation phase that is foreseen in the new operational concept proposed in the Single European Sky Research (SESAR) program. In particular, this paper describes a possible strategy for the <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> {{in order to deal}} with the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) process that is expected in this future scenario. In the SESAR scenario, <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> will become owners of their trajectories and they will be responsible to solve possible mismatches between capacity and demand in a particular airspace sector. The aim of this strategy is to improve the efficiency in the CDM process by computing the different operational costs associated to different solutions that may solve a particular demand-capacity imbalance in the airspace. This will allow them to optimise their operating costs while reducing fuel consumption and therefore being more environmentally friendly. Some suggestions have already been done for the CDM mechanism, for instance the use of auctions. However, the different options that aircraft operators might use have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, the authors propose an optimisation framework for aircraft operators aimed at computing 4 D trajectories with time constraints to deal, in this way, with possible airspace regulations. Once a nominal flight plan and a potential regulation is known, it is suggested to compute several possible alternative flight plans (including rerouting, but also altitude and speed profiles) that may solve the capacity-demand problem. If more than one regulation is applied to the flight, a tree of options is subsequently computed. The cost of each optimised the option is also calculated in order to allow the <b>airspace</b> <b>users</b> to initiate the negotiation process with other airlines.
