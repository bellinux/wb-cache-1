5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass on Earth is plant life, on which <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> have been {{identified}} to date, and estimates of {{the actual number of}} existing species range from several million to well over 50million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves {{from within the}} body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E

5|$|Martin Glaessner {{proposed}} in The Dawn of <b>Animal</b> <b>Life</b> (1984) that the Ediacaran biota were recognizable crown group members of modern phyla, but were unfamiliar {{because they had}} yet to evolve the characteristic features we use in modern classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests and}} meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> {{including}} foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. Mule deer {{are the most}} common large mammals in the park. Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.|$|E
5|$|All {{motorized}} {{vehicles are}} prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. Berries and mushrooms can be harvested for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with a hunting or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in a leash between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> and cultural heritage.|$|E

5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>life</b> {{indigenous}} to Malawi includes mammals such as elephants, hippos, big cats, monkeys, lemurs and bats; {{a great variety}} of birds including birds of prey, parrots and falcons, waterfowl and large waders, owls and songbirds. Lake Malawi has been described as having one of the richest lake fish faunas in the world, being the home for some 200 mammal, 650 bird, 30+ mollusc, and 5,500+ plant species.|$|E
5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects. Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, great horned owl, eastern screech owl and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of <b>animal</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of <b>animal</b> <b>life.</b> Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
50|$|Filmed {{at a great}} distance, The Wild Nation {{features}} various animals {{species in}} several locations, without any human interaction. Frédéric Rossif wanted to film the spontaneity and lack of reflection that takes part in the <b>animals</b> <b>life's.</b>|$|R

5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton {{spent much of his}} youth in the 1870s studying <b>animal</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Salta, and the Moss in particular, {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>life,</b> {{including}} some rare specimens. Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the Moss, and prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E
5000|$|Thylacosmilus had large, saber-like canines. The {{roots of}} these canines grew {{throughout}} the <b>animal's</b> <b>life,</b> growing {{in an arc}} up the maxilla and above the orbits.

50|$|Research has {{indicated}} that certain themes and images such as children, <b>animals,</b> <b>life</b> cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and {{may be used in}} international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).|$|R
50|$|Sometimes three narrators {{describe}} {{the animals and}} their behavior, relating them to mythology and how the <b>animals</b> <b>life's</b> are influenced by love and death.

5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and <b>animal</b> <b>life.</b> It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{hardwood forest}} also contains the greatest diversity of <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> in the notch. Mammals include chipmunks, raccoons, white-tailed deer, black bears, and moose. There {{are also a}} large number of birds in this forest; frequently seen are red-eyed vireos, hermit thrushes, and ovenbirds. Amphibians are also found in the northern hardwood forest. Red efts, the terrestrial stage of development for the red-spotted newt, congregate in large numbers after heavy rains; also present are American toads, spring peepers, and wood frogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (<b>animal)</b> <b>life</b> on Earth.|$|E
6000|$|For {{many years}} the writer has been {{watching}} animals and recording his observations {{with the idea of}} determining, if possible, which of these three is the governing factor in the <b>animal's</b> <b>life.</b> Some of {{the results of this study}} were published last year in a book called [...] "School of the Woods," [...] which consisted of certain studies of <b>animals</b> from <b>life,</b> and certain theories in the form of essays to account for what the writer's eyes had seen and his own ears heard in the great wilderness among the animals.|$|R
50|$|Park’s fauna is {{represented}} by more than 4000 species of invertebrates and 210 species of vertebrae (including 187 protected).

5|$|Tungsten is {{the only}} metal from the third {{transition}} series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to <b>animal</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Hillenburg was there, {{his love}} of the ocean began to {{influence}} his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which {{was used by the}} institute to teach visiting students about the <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> of tide pools. The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters. Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>life</b> are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
