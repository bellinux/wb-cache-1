It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment.

5000|$|Following {{the weak}} {{commercial}} success of Glitter (2001), her debut release under Virgin Records, Carey suffered an {{emotional and physical}} breakdown, followed by an extended hospitalization. During this period, Carey's older label, Columbia records, planned to release a compilation album of her biggest hits, titled Greatest Hits (2001). As they had one more album to release from Carey under her old contract, they began assembling content for its release. Though still signed to Virgin, Carey composed a charity single in which all proceeds would go towards helping rebuild America, following the terrorist attacks. Consequently, she re-recorded her 1993 song [...] "Hero", and made a medley of it with a single from Glitter, [...] "Never Too Far". The song features a different instrumental introduction, and begins with the first verse and chorus of [...] "Never Too Far", and blends into the bridge of [...] "Hero". Several writers for the medley are credited, with Carey having written [...] "Never Too Far" [...] with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and the latter with Walter Afanasieff. Aside from Jam and Lewis, Randy Jackson assisted Carey in the song's production.

5000|$|What Men Talk About? Of course, women. But {{also about}} work, money, cars, {{football}} ... {{but in general}} about women. And if they have two days when they escape from their offices and families, {{to get away from}} all the cares and commitments - two days, eventful and adventurous - {{you can be sure that}} this time they will have time to discuss a lot of things ... And More. From these conversations - we know for sure - many women learn about themselves a lot of new things. Four friends <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Odessa for the concert of a famous Russian band ‘B-2’. Two of them, Alexey and Sasha, have problems in the morning: one can not deal with things around the house, the other - cannot get rid of the annoying customers at work. When, finally, they join their other friends who already left, Camille and Slava, they begin to talk about all sorts of things. Thus, the first day on the road passes. They spend the night in a hotel village ‘Beldyazhki’. The next day, the heroes continue to talk about life, passing through Kiev, where they buy paintings by Tishchenko and at the same time discussing modern art. By the end of the movie 4 men get into a car accident, but still make it in time for the concert. [...] "What Men Talk About" [...] - this is the third, and by far, the best film of the cult theater [...] "Quartet". Four middle-aged friends receive an invitation from their friend in Odessa to come to him for his birthday, and at the same time attend a concert of a famous Russian group [...] "B-2". Each of them, like all of us, has a difficulty with time. One has work, the second - has his wife and children, the third - has both work and family, but still, with great a difficulty, they manage to escape for a few days. They sit in the car and go to the long journey. On the road, they have many adventures, many of which can knock a person out of a rut. But when you have people next to you with whom you can talk about everything, all the hardships of life become insignificant ... And real men are known to have a lot of different topics for discussion. Work, parties, money, music, clubs, and of course - women. If a man is still single, he is concerned about the issue - whether to get married. And married ones concern whether they can cheat on their wife.|$|E

40|$|Cue: In Zimbabwe, {{three years}} of poor {{rainfall}} have had a devastating effect on crop yields. Many are attributing the shortage of good rains {{to the process of}} global warming, raising fears about the long-term future of agriculture in the country, and indeed the region. In response, the government is trying to raise awareness of the relationship that exists between people and their environment. Dumisani Nyoni, a senior agricultural extension officer for Matabeleland North province, spoke to Busani Bafana about the climatic changes affecting Zimbabwe and how the government?s programmes and policies are addressing these changes. IN:		?We seem to note that? OUT:		?guiding all the processes involved? DUR?N	 4 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dumisani Nyoni of Zimbabwe?s agricultural extension service. Transcript Nyoni	We seem to note that there is a decline in rainfall received annually. There is also a decline in terms {{of the quality of the}} rainfall season; that is the spread of rainfall over the season, such that you might receive a lot of rain within a short space of time, but unfortunately the distribution is poor. We have also noticed that there is an increase of temperatures, that is also affecting, during the dry spells, the survival of the crops. Bafana	Would you say the farmers have started changing their farming methods in line with the climatic changes? Nyoni	The tendency now is to move away from the traditional cropping system, which was maize based, to production of sorghum, production of pearl millets, cowpeas, groundnuts, crops that can grow with about 350 mm of rain. But of course what still needs to change, and change drastically, are our food preferences, because we might be growing sorghum or pearl millet, but few of our farmers in this area have a preference now for that food. But traditionally these were always the crops that were being grown. Bafana	Would you then say the extension services are addressing the issues of climatic change? Nyoni	We have weekly radio programmes that are looking at the seasonal forecast in terms of rainfall, and we have also now ten day forecasts, which indicate what temperatures will be like, that indicate what rainfall is likely to be received within that particular week or ten day period. What then happens is that as we broadcast these programmes to farmers, we have begun a process of making farmers aware of the impact of the weather on their cropping programmes, or their agricultural programmes. Bafana	For some farmers, the issue of climate change comes no doubt as a shock. Would you say you have encountered any major problems in trying to address this issue? Nyoni	Farmers are realising that there are changes taking place. It is only maybe that the process of discussing climate or global change issues in our region is still behind the international pace as it were. But farmers are realising that there are changes taking place, and probably the more we intensify environmental education, encompassing global change issues, I think farmers will begin to appreciate more and more, what they are contributing to environmental change, and how the environmental change is impacting on their lives. Bafana	And would you say there are any success stories? Nyoni	I would say we are moving in the right direction, in the sense that once farmers begin to appreciate that the natural resources management in their areas has an impact is terms of the quality of season they get, that is a step forward. Although unfortunately the limiting factor is poverty; farmers are beginning to realise that the moment you cut down or degrade the environment, it is bound to come back and haunt you, in terms of the rainfall you receive, in terms of the effectiveness of the rainfall you receive, and in terms of what agricultural practices you can perform on the ground. So this is a process that needs both education and also addressing issues of poverty, because the hungry man will not listen to reason, because he or she wants to fulfil the immediate need, that of food, first. Bafana	And lastly Mr. Nyoni, Zimbabwe has made great strides in actually changing the Environmental Act, in order to address several environmental issues, which I believe one of them is climatic change. What impact will the changes in the Act have? Nyoni	Having this Environmental Act in place will have a positive impact in terms of natural resources management in the country. What we need to do now, is educate and engage communities in thorough discussions, so that they see how they contribute to environmental change, how they need to contribute to environmental management, so that at the end of the day we produce whatever we produce on a sustainable basis. It?s going to be an engaging process that requires a lot of resources, and a lot of time. And we need to go into schools, we need to go into farming communities, with this message. But what is good about this Environmental Act, is that all government departments, all non-governmental organisations that have a part to play in environmental management issues, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the people, to the stakeholders, with one voice, with one Act guiding all the processes involved.
