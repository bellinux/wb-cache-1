5|$|In Caernarfon's {{case the}} walls of the town and castle {{remained}} in good condition, while features which required maintenancesuch as roofswere in a state of decay and much timber was rotten. Conditions were so poor that of the castles seven towers and two gatehouses, only the Eagle Tower and the King's Gate had roofs by 1620. The domestic buildings inside the castle had been stripped of anything valuable, such as glass and iron. Despite the disrepair of the domestic buildings, the castle's defences were in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> state that during the English Civil War in the mid-17thcentury it was garrisoned by Royalists. Caernarfon Castle was besieged three times during the war. The constable was John Byron, 1st Baron Byron, who surrendered Caernarfon to Parliamentarian forces in 1646. It was the last time Caernarfon Castle saw fighting. Although it was ordered in 1660 that the castle and town walls should be dismantled, the work was aborted early on and may never have started.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E

A right-arm fast bowler, he then took 2/89 from 21 overs with the ball, taking the wickets of both openers, the Australian XI captain and Jack Ryder. When Harrold batted the second time, Ryder trapped him leg before wicket without scoring, to give his side victory by an innings and 45 runs.|$|E
25|$|Because of Genie's {{previous}} treatment Miner and David Rigler {{arranged for}} her to stay at Children's Hospital for two weeks, where her condition moderately improved. Authorities then placed Genie in another foster home, where she did fairly well, but in mid-December 1977 the arrangement very suddenly ended. Through {{the end of that}} month into early January Genie lived in a temporary setting, after which authorities put her in another foster home. During this time Curtiss wrote to Miner that Genie did not understand the reasons she was moving and believed it was her fault for not being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> person, and said the frequency with which her living arrangements changed further traumatized her and caused continued developmental regression.|$|E
25|$|Torquay United {{had been}} both the last team to finish bottom {{under the old}} {{election}} system, and the last team to finish bottom of the League and survive due to the Conference champions not having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> ground. However, this season they finished bottom and {{dropped out of the}} League. They were joined by Boston United, who had voluntary arrangements in the 87th minute of the season's final game, but would still have been relegated even without the 10-point administration penalty. In a first since the introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and Conference, Boston were relegated two divisions due to failing to pay footballing creditors, along with financial irregularities committed during their promotion season in 2001-02.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{position}} in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham {{was one of the}} last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials– they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 & Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the 2004 and 2005 F1 seasons, BMW Motorsport and {{director}} Mario Theissen increasingly became publicly critical of the Williams F1 team's inability to create a package capable of winning the Constructors' Championship, or even multiple victories within a single season. Williams, on the other hand, blamed BMW for not producing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> engine. Williams's failed attempt to prise Jenson Button out of his BAR contract may also have been an issue with Theissen. Despite Frank Williams's rare decision to capitulate to commercial demands by employing German driver Nick Heidfeld when he allegedly preferred Antônio Pizzonia, the fallout between BMW and Williams continued through the 2005 Formula One season. Despite BMW's contract with Williams to supply engines until 2009, this public deterioration of the relationship between BMW and Williams was a factor in the decision by BMW Motorsport to buy Sauber and rebrand that team to feature the BMW name.|$|E

Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip.

25|$|Like so many Nottinghamshire-born men, Albert Hallam took to cricket at {{an early}} age. However, as he developed, he was not seen as good enough for a regular place in the Nottinghamshire eleven and, already {{residing}} in Leicestershire, played for them {{for a number of}} years in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Though these matches were not first-class, Hallam acquired <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> reputation for Lancashire, desperate for support for the seemingly irrepressible Mold and Briggs, to encourage Hallam to qualify. He steadily improved, and by 1896 Hallam's slow bowling was already providing Lancashire with a third force in attack. He actually beat Briggs in the averages and was only a fraction behind Mold, though he did less than half as much bowling as the two established bowlers. The following year, these three bowlers, together with the newly imported Willis Cuttell, gave Lancashire a deadly attack on any helpful wicket and they won the County Championship. Hallam bowled consistently well and in all matches just reached 100 wickets. Nevertheless Wisden and many batsmen thought he was not nearly so good as the other three bowlers because he was too regular on dry pitches and helped batsmen to play themselves in.|$|E
