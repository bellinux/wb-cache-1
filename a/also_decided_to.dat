5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway <b>also</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E

He <b>also</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races.

Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords.
