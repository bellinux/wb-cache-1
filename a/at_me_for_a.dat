2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Democracy Now!, Cole noted {{that he had not}} applied for the Yale job: [...] "Some people at Yale asked if they could look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> senior appointment. I said, 'Look all you want.' So that's up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You're being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn't result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously." [...] He described the so-called [...] "scandal" [...] surrounding his nomination as [...] "a tempest in a teapot" [...] that had been exaggerated by [...] "neo-con journalists": [...] "Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment reflectively.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, doubtfully, {{and then}} she shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... “My man,” she said, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant with tremulous lids which fluttered {{down and}} veiled {{her eyes as}} she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> explanation. I {{pointed to}} the dark object {{by the side of}} the creek. She gave a violent start. Then she screamed and caught hold of my arm.|$|R
6000|$|Roche glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{and then}} {{without a word}} of question, shouted to the audience, [...] "Wait a moment! We have <b>a</b> speaker <b>for</b> next Sunday." [...] Then, bending down, he asked of me, [...] "What is your name and occupation?" ...|$|R
60|$|She looked wonderingly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} {{broke into a}} laugh.|$|E
60|$|He glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment as}} though he doubted I should understand.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment in}} silence, the cloud upon his brow deepening.|$|E
60|$|He blinked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> long time, {{his eyes}} running full of tears again.|$|R
60|$|Xavier stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and {{considering}} {{that he knew}} nothing of my character, I thought it extremely impolite of him to laugh. Indeed, he tried to control himself, for some reason standing in awe of my appearance, and then he burst out into such loud haw-haws that the crew poked their heads above the cabin hatch.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> searchingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} {{abruptly}} {{took up the}} tale.|$|R
60|$|Betteredge stopped, looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{nodded his}} head, and walked on again.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{and then}} took another swig from his bottle.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or}} two, pulling his untidy beard. I smiled at him.|$|E
60|$|With {{her brows}} {{slightly}} knitted, {{as if she}} did not exactly understand my words, my companion looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. Then her eyes sparkled, her lips parted, and a flush of quick comprehension passed over her face. She put back her head and laughed until she almost lost her breath. I looked upon her, shocked and wounded to the soul.|$|R
60|$|He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> stupidly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Then {{he laughed}} in a silly, {{crackling}} fashion.|$|R
60|$|He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> speechlessly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and then, out {{of sheer}} impotency, turned to go.|$|R
60|$|He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long moment, {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then {{he swallowed}} hard.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} anguish {{in her eyes}} that turned my misery into torture.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, {{and then}} he got into the chair, and I shut him up.|$|E
60|$|This time I {{certainly}} scored. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> fixedly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Then {{she laughed}} softly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Irene looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{and then}} she stood up in the car. I saw her put one foot upon the seat which {{surrounds}} it; then quickly appeared the other foot upon {{the edge of the}} car. She raised both arms and joined her hands above her head; she pushed herself between the ropes and leaped. It was all the work of a second.|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} shake hands with me, he hastened to the door, as if anxious to hide from my {{observation}} the grief and apprehension which had evidently overcome him. But, just at the moment when he was leaving the room, he hesitated, turned round, looked sorrowfully <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and then, retracing his steps, gave me his hand, pressed mine <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment in silence, and left me.|$|R
60|$|The {{policeman}} {{stood there}} looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and then 'e {{began to laugh}} till he couldn't stop 'imself.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} an air of perplexity, as if she really could not {{remember}} whom I was.|$|E
6000|$|... "She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} she went away and fetched a tall, bald-headed man with grey side-whiskers and a large nose.|$|E
60|$|She paused again. The colour {{that had}} spread over her cheeks {{suddenly}}, as suddenly left them. The {{hand on the}} album resigned its hold, trembled a little, and moved the book away from her. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant--then turned her head aside in the chair. Her handkerchief {{fell to the floor}} as she changed her position, and she hurriedly hid her face from me in her hands.|$|R
6000|$|I felt so interested, that I {{could not}} help calling to the gardener, as he was retiring, and asking what unfortunate family it was that had {{suffered}} so severely? The old man touched his hat, and gazed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, as if hardly comprehending my question. [...] "Family!" [...] replied he, [...] "there be no family in the case, your honour; but here have been sad mischief done in the rookery!" ...|$|R
60|$|Phaidor {{stood looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. No anger showed {{in her eyes}} this time, only a pathetic {{expression}} of hopeless sorrow.|$|R
60|$|I nodded. He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} an astonishment to which I was wholly indifferent. He {{did not seem}} to know just how to act.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked puzzled}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment--then smiled (the first time I {{had seen her}} do so for many a long day)--then put her arms round my neck.|$|E
60|$|Felicia looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} wide-open eyes. Then a little stream of color rushed into her cheeks, her lips slowly parted, and she laughed, not {{altogether}} without embarrassment.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked to}} the door, then turned round, and smiled {{as if she were}} about to speak again; but checked herself, and merely looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. In that instant, however, the smile left her face, and the grave, anxious {{expression}} came again. She went out softly. A few minutes afterwards the roll of the carriage which took her and her companion to the ball, died away heavily on my ear. I was left alone in the house--alone for the night.|$|R
6000|$|My mother {{remarked that}} she did not {{understand}} exactly what a torpedo was, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> explanation. I confess that her remark surprised <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> during the course of my investigations and inventions, I had frequently mentioned the subject of torpedoes to her, and once or twice had given her a particular description of the destructive machine. However, as she had evidently forgotten all about it, and as I cannot resist the temptation to elucidate complex subjects when opportunity offers, I began:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{woman looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> steadfastly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, {{and then she}} rose to her feet. Then she called out, {{as if she were}} crying fish or strawberries: ...|$|R
