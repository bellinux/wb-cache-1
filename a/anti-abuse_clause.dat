40|$|As {{a result}} of the tax reform of 2014, which took place through Law No. 2 / 2014 of 16 / 01 the Transfer Pricing regime, whose main purpose is to {{regulate}} transactions between related companies, respecting the arm's length principle, has undergone considerable changes. In this work, based on the relevant and legal literature, we conducted a qualitative investigation to investigate the impact of the changes occurred in the level of deductibility of Corporate Income Tax (IRC) expenses, enshrined in no. 23 of the Corporate Income Tax Code (CIRC), specifically the disappearance of the requirement of indispensability. From this investigation, we conclude that the now "omission" requirement of indispensability still lingers {{in the spirit of the}} law. Next, it was crucial to understand the extent to which the aforementioned reform affected the Transfer Pricing regime, understood as a specific <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>clause,</b> taking into account that the same institute can be used as a tax planning instrument. This culminated, with the repeal of no. 5 of article 23 of the CIRC, which in our view is a sensible measure. We conclude with the question whether the arm's length principle conflicts with the principle of freedom of business management decisions. To that extent, in the light of the existing literature and case-law, and given the practical difficulty in applying the arm's length principle, coupled with the excessive interference of the Tributary and customs authority, it will be possible to some extent to do so...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the taxation of hybrid instruments {{and the impact}} of the new amendments adopted to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive in Finland. A Government Bill 59 / 2015 proposed the Directive amendments to be implemented to 6 a§ of the Business Income Tax Act (EVL) to tackle hybrid mismatch arrangements and to prevent any misuse of the Directive. Hybrid instruments are financial instruments that have both equity and debt characteristics, which makes the classification to either equity or debt difficult. Finnish legislation does not recognize hybrid instruments but the classification in practice follows the legal form of the instrument. Classification problems typically arise when a hybrid loan has equity characteristics but there has been no case law so far where a hybrid loan has been reclassified as equity for tax purposes. Hybrid mismatches are born in cross-border transactions e. g. when hybrid instrument is classified differently in different tax jurisdictions. These arrangements can lead to double non-taxation, i. e. to an outcome where the income generated by the instrument is not taxed anywhere. Lately, EU and OECD have aimed to prevent aggressive tax planning and the amendments to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive are part of EU's larger plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. Amendments aim to refrain from granting the Directive benefits, i. e. tax exemption on direct investment dividends in the parent company's Member State, in situations where the same distribution is considered tax deductible in the Member State of the subsidiary. Furthermore, a general <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>clause</b> was adopted to prevent any misuse of the Directive and to ensure a greater consistency in its application in different Member States. It is applicable in situations where the arrangement is not seen "genuine" or if one of its main purposes is tax avoidance. Amendments to the Directive were implemented to Finnish Business Income Tax Act 6 a§ by adding paragraphs 8 and 9, which are applied from tax year 2016 onwards. Impacts to Finnish entities remain somewhat unclear regarding the new anti-abuse rule. Since hybrid instruments are in principle considered as debt, situations where a Finnish entity is a debtor in a hybrid arrangement seem more common than vice versa. Thus, the impact of the new legislation regarding new paragraph 8 is not likely very significant. However, companies' administrative burden will grow, as tax treatment of the dividend distribution in the source state needs to be figured out. The new regulation will also overrule any dividend exemptions in tax treaties, since it is argued {{that the purpose of the}} new regulation is to prevent double non-taxation whereas double tax treaties' purpose is to eliminate double taxation, not to enable it...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a surge of new {{political}} initiatives {{with the aim of}} combating tax evasion and tax avoidance. As a part of these initiatives on the level of the European Union, the Council enacted in January 2015 a new general anti-abuse provision to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The Parent-Subsidiary Directive regulates tax benefits to cross-border distributions in the EU with the purpose of eliminating obstacles to formation of corporate groups across the Member State borders. The Directive contained previously a provision that authorized the Member States to apply their national anti-abuse provisions within the scope of the Directive although the application of these provisions was voluntary, and the content and scope of the national provisions was not regulated by the Directive. In the words of the Commission, the purpose of the change was to prevent misuse of the Directive and to create consistency, and these aims were to be achieved by introduction of a common anti-abuse rule in all the Member States. The new general anti-abuse rule in the Parent-Subsidiary Directive represents an approach without precedents in the field of European direct tax law since it creates a detailed anti-abuse provision with the objective of harmonizing the national anti-abuse rules applicable to the benefits of the Directive. Most of all, the Member States are, from now on, obliged to combat abuse within the scope of the Directive since the new provision has to be implemented and applied nationally. The provision raises, however, several questions regarding its application and its effects as a part of European tax legislation. The wording of the provision, which contains several conditions with the aim of defining abuse {{in the context of the}} Directive, reflects the varying formulations the ECJ has used in its case law on anti-abuse measures. It may appear prima facie that the provision marks a departure from the consistent case law and creates a new concept of abuse in the field of European tax law. The purpose of the research is to discuss the possible interpretations and the impact of the new provision. The different conditions of the provision are evaluated in the light of the ECJ case law in order to clarify their scope and meaning. The effects of the provision are discussed with respect to the immediate effects of its application, the effects on the Member States and their national anti-abuse rules, and the possible conflicts with the primary law of the EU. The ECJ direct tax case law contains a line of case law where the Court has examined abuse of tax law and the possibility to enact measures in order to combat abusive transactions. The concept of abuse within the field of European direct tax law has been developed especially in relation to such Member State anti-abuse measures which have had restrictive effects on the fundamental freedoms. In this case law, the ECJ has required that these anti-abuse provisions must combat only "wholly artificial arrangements", and the Court has developed specific tests which the national rules must respect when establishing the abusive nature of a transaction. This case law is discussed extensively in order to establish the possible interpretations for the new provision. Regarding the interpretation of the new anti-abuse provision, most questions arise in relation to the relevance of tax purposes and the genuine-nature of the arrangement. Given the variance in the ECJ case law, several ways to interpret the provision are compared in order to establish the most reasonable interpretation. In addition, the discussion reveals different points of uncertainty with regard to the way how the benefits of the Directive are meant to be denied and how the implementation of the provision affects national <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>clauses</b> and the freedom of movement. The research establishes that the new anti-abuse provision can be interpreted in accordance with the established ECJ case law although the wide latitudes of the provision mean that it can be subjected to various interpretations. The most important effects of the provision reside in its compulsory application and the impact on national legislation. The provision can, effectively, prevent the national legislators from adopting different solutions in its scope of application. The actual consequences for the companies that fall within the ambit of the provision contain several questions that cannot be given an unequivocal answer based on the wording of the provision alone. Most of all, the provision is set to cause uncertainty before its scope has been definitely scrutinized by the ECJ...|$|R
