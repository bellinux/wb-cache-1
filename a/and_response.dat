5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire <b>and</b> <b>response</b> and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of Dominican music {{include the}} West African use of call <b>and</b> <b>response</b> singing, {{clapping}} {{as a major}} part of rhythm and lyrical, dance and rhythmic improvisation. Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French, and are traditionally sung by women (chantwèl), while the instrumental traditions are predominantly practiced by men. Drums, generically known as lapo kabwit, are the most prominent part of Dominica's instrumental tradition.|$|E
5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm.

In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness <b>and</b> <b>Response</b> Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster they have had to deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E

5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection <b>and</b> <b>response</b> is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, <b>and</b> <b>response</b> to medication is often limited.|$|E

Members of the United States Department of Homeland Security laid out the groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000volunteers participated in the $1million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, the Department of Homeland Security worked in conjunction with the United States Coast Guard to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game. Similar exercises were conducted on the Allegheny River in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade <b>and</b> <b>response)</b> received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those patients with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes {{as well as for}} those who lack early response to treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle {{the technical aspects of}} investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis <b>and</b> <b>Response</b> Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E
5|$|The process {{requires}} the regulator to directly link a robust risk assessment to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is {{also referred to}} as the Compliance Model in some regulatory agencies. See for example the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority risk differentiation approach known as: PAIRS / SOARS. PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight <b>And</b> <b>Response</b> System.|$|E
