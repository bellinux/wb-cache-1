25|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Reading in 1987 with a BSc in Botany, Beath went on to study for a PhD in Tropical ecology at the University of Aberdeen between 1989 and 1993. During his {{post-graduate}} and post-doctoral period, he travelled extensively through the rainforests of the Old and New World, including several years' experience in West Africa and Central America. It was here that he did {{much of the research}} for his papers and articles on the pollination of <b>Amorphophallus</b> johnsonii by Silphidae, the biology and pollination ecology of Araceae in Ghana and spadix heating in African arcaeae.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tropical}} greenhouse {{a variety of}} tropical and subtropical plants {{from all over the}} world can be found. Some of the plants include a variety of food and medicinal plants including Coffea arabica (coffee), Camellia sinensis (tea), Vanilla planifolia (vanilla), Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Oryza sativa (rice), Theobroma cacao (cacao), Siphonochilus aethiopicus (wild ginger), Warburghia salutaris (pepper bark tree) and Piper nigrum (pepper). The tropical greenhouse also houses many other exotic plants from a variety of families most notably the Orchid family. Many indigenous epiphytic orchids such as Ansellia africana (leopard orchid) and Mystacidium capense, can be found in this greenhouse. Other interesting plants on display include <b>Amorphophallus</b> titanum (giant corpse flower), Hydnophytum formicarum (ant plant), Heliconia humilis (lobster plant), Nepenthes alata (pitcher plant) and Ravenala madagascariensis (travelers palm). In 2010 Victoria cruziana (giant Amazon waterlily) was also successfully grown in {{the tropical}} greenhouse which drew numerous curious visitors to the Garden. This was the first successful recorded cultivation in many decades for South Africa.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Amorphophallus</b> abyssinicus, {{also known}} as Bagana (Sidamo), is a plant of the genus <b>Amorphophallus.</b> It is native to {{southern}} Ethiopia, where it is grown in gardens.|$|E
50|$|A runner-up is <b>Amorphophallus</b> gigas, {{which is}} taller, {{but has a}} {{somewhat}} smaller flower. <b>Amorphophallus</b> konjac tubers are used to make konnyaku (コンニャク), a Japanese thickening agent and edible jelly containing glucomannan.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{flower in}} the world, the Rafflesia arnoldii, has its natural habitat in Kepahiang and the Province of Bengkulu in South-Sumatra. Its blossoḿs {{diameter}} can {{be up to}} 1 meter and weigh up to 11 kg. Sporadic occurrence of this flower are reported from Aceh and parts of Malaysia. Furthermore, Kepahiang {{is also home to}} the Bangkai flower, a member of the <b>Amorphophallus</b> genus. The flower is of different types such as the Bangkai Raksasa, Suweg Raksasa or Titan Arum (<b>Amorphophallus</b> gigas), more commonly known as Sumatra Giant <b>Amorphophallus.</b> The <b>Amorphophallus</b> titanum can reach a height of up to 6 meters and therefore is the highest flower in the world followed by the <b>Amorphophallus</b> gigas. These flowers give an impression of the unique natural environment found in the Regency of Kepahiang.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "corpse flower" [...] {{applied to}} Rafflesia can be {{confusing}} because this common name also {{refers to the}} titan arum (<b>Amorphophallus</b> titanum) of the family Araceae. Moreover, because <b>Amorphophallus</b> has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world's largest flower. Both Rafflesia and <b>Amorphophallus</b> are flowering plants, but they are only distantly related. Rafflesia arnoldii has the largest single flower of any flowering plant, {{at least in terms}} of weight. <b>Amorphophallus</b> titanum has the largest unbranched inflorescence, while the talipot palm (Corypha umbraculifera) forms the largest branched inflorescence, containing thousands of flowers; the talipot is monocarpic, meaning the individual plants die after flowering.|$|E

50|$|Pseudodracontium is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} Araceae family. It currently consists of 7 species. The genus was created by N. E. Brown in 1882 to account for two species in <b>Amorphophallus</b> and Dracontium. However, molecular evidence may result in Pseudodracontium being sunk into <b>Amorphophallus.</b>|$|E
