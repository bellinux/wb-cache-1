Papa went to his room and I went with the lady principal. [...] At length the guests began to <b>arive,</b> but papa still remained in his [...] room until called for. Papa read in the chapell. It was the first [...] time I had ever heard him read in my life--that is in public. When [...] he came out on to the stage I remember the people behind me [...] exclaimed [...] "Oh how queer he is! Isn't he funny!" [...] I thought papa was [...] very funny, although I did not think him queer. He read [...] "A Trying [...] Situation" [...] and [...] "The Golden Arm," [...] a ghost story that he heard down [...] South when he was a little boy. [...] "The Golden Arm" [...] papa had told me [...] before, but he had startled me so that I did not much wish to hear [...] it again. But I had resolved this time to be prepared and not to [...] let myself be startled, but still papa did, and very very much; he [...] startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as one man. [...] The other story was also very funny and interesting and I enjoyed [...] the evening inexpressibly much. After papa had finished reading we [...] all went down to the collation in the dining-room and after that [...] there was dancing and singing. Then the guests went away and papa [...] and I went to bed. The next morning we rose early, took an early [...] train for Hartford and reached Hartford at 1/2 past 2 o'clock.

40|$|Objectives: Refugees resettling in the United States {{bring with}} them a number of health conditions, the {{majority}} chronic. These health conditions may impact their ability to be successful with disease self-management and employment, and acculturate and thrive in their new communities. Knowledge of health conditions present in individual refugee populations can be of benefit to healthcare providers {{in the community and}} public health. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the state of health among refugees newly arriving in the US and resettling in Kentucky during 2016. Methods: Using data from the domestic health screens, immunization clinics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Electronic Disease Notification, a database entitled Arriving Refugee Informatics Surveillance and Epidemiology (<b>ARIVE)</b> was developed and the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system used as the platform. Results: A total of 1495 adult and pediatric refugees were screened during January-June 2016 in Louisville, Lexington, Owensboro, and Bowling Green, Kentucky and data entered into <b>ARIVE.</b> Results from those domestic health screenings identified dental abnormalities (60 %), obesity (23 %), decreased visual acuity (14 %), hyperlipidemia (14 %), and elevated blood lead levels in child refugees (12 %). Latent tuberculosis infection was identified in 13 % and more than 32 % had evidence of at least one intestinal parasite. Conditions of social importance included tobacco use among 16 %. Mental health issues were evident as 15 % had a positive Refugee Health Screener (RHS- 15) result and more than 13 % indicated they had witnessed or experienced torture. Conclusions: This analysis shows that the main health conditions facing refugees after arriving in the US are chronic conditions that require long‐term medical management and support services. Upon review of these results, a systematic approach to solving the problem of long‐term follow‐up needs to be established for refugees in order to address and decrease the impact of chronic health conditions. Using information from this Kentucky assessment may promote interest in a national refugee health database as a means of developing population-based and population-specific interventions to improve overall health...|$|E

Arbitrary categories (e. g. the possible syntactic categories of a word) have to be rote-learned, and are stored in the mental lexicon. Predictable categories (e. g. the proper syllabification of words) can be computed when needed and do not have to be stored. Instead, the required computation c [...] ...|$|E

The facilitation and making of these choices involves complex processes, however, which apparently have not yet been studied in depth; this is the purpose of this study. A grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis has been used within a interpretive framework, influenced by symbolic interaction, to develop middle range, substantive theory. Mid, <b>Arives</b> and pregnant women were accessed from four maternity units. Data were collected by means of loosely structured interviews and observation. All 48 interviews were transcribed and provided the main source of data. Convenience sampling was supplemented later in the study by theoretical sampling. Data were analysed and theoretical frameworks constructed according to grounded theory method. Several strategies were used to confirm the trustworthiness of the data and their analysis. From the midwives data, the core category was identified as Protective Steering, whereby midwives tried to steer the women and themselves through various pitfalls and dilemmas. Substantive categories were Orienting, Raising Awareness and Protective Gatekeeping. The core category emerging from the women's data was Maintaining Equilibrium, whereby the woman attempted to make decisions that would preserve the balance of her life, and that of her family. Substantive categories were Regulating, Contextualising and Actioning. The category which linked the two sets of data and theoretical frameworks was named Balancing: Walking a Tightrope. Two main over-arching issues emerged as power and trust. Issues of power related to the study are discussed mainly in terms of Foucault's and Lukes' interpretations of power. Trust is discussed in relation to existing theories and their application to this study. Recommendations for midwifery practice are made, together with hypotheses for further exploration...|$|R

They {{are on their way}} up to the top floor {{to take part in the}} building society's anniversary celebrations. Suddenly, the space becomes a sort of an altered reality. It becomes a place where the real becomes unreal; where emotions are raw and extra sensitive. It even prompts the very nature of the characters to change and secrets to be revealed.Entire plot revolves around a murder. Meghna Raj is murdered and her dead body is found on the top of the elevator. Commissioner who is entrapped in the lift investigate the murder case. He interrogates all those people who are entrapped with him in the lift. Later, it is revealed that the commissioner has plotted with murderer's husband to cover the murder up and hide the real murderer. The real murderer is Prasanna who is a dancer as well as apartment builder's wife. She accidentally kills Meghna. She plots with Meghna to kill her husband(Christy).Meghna invites Christy to writer's flat to have sex with her. While having sex, she messages Prasanna to come to that flat. Prasanna <b>arives</b> and see her husband in compromising position with Meghna. Christy was lying on the top of Meghna when she tried to hit him with a stand. At the same time, Meghna takes a dagger to stab him from behind while they are entangled in an intimate hug. But, unfortunately Prasanna missed her target and instead hits Megha with the stand. Thus, Meghna dies. Meghna's intention was to avenge Christy for the murder of her husband. Christy cheated on Meghna's husband who was Christy's co-partner. When Meghna enquiried Christy about her missing husband he intimidated her by telling her about the debts of her husband. He tried to assure her that he would relieve her off from those debts if she slept with him. When she disagreed he forced himself upon her. He raped her. She some how fleed city and came back as a prostitute after 4 years to take revenge. She befriended the writer to get close to Christy.She introduced herself as professional escort to Christy and willfully had sex with him. When this 'bang - bang' went on for a while she became a trusted ally of Christy. When Meghna understood that Christy had indeed killed her husband she decided to kill him. The day on which she was murdered, she called Christy to come to writer's flat to have sex. But, Christy told her that he wanted her to satisfy a prestigious guest of him, not him.when she lustfully insisted that he should come to the flat for a while to 'bang' her, he agreed. She prepared herself to kill that person who ruined her life. She informed Christy's wife about all the wrong things he had done to her and plotted with her. When Christy arrived she took all her dress off and laid naked on the bed and invitingly extended her hand to him to join her. He took her hand and laid him self on the top of naked Meghna and started enjoying her. He was savouring her. That is when Prasanna arrived and changed the direction of the story. Prasanna confessed truth to Commissioner that she killed Meghna. Then it is revealed that Commissioner already know who is the real culprit. Movie end with the death of commissioner and Christy. The lift operator who had a soft corner for Meghna shot both of them to death while they were in the lift. Prasanna takes care of Meghna's child. Lift operator is arrested for the murder of Meghna, Commissioner and Christy.|$|R
30|$|Tirumandiram {{states that}} {{individual}} self {{is none other}} than Śiva who has forgotten his real nature (v 2017). When jiva cognizes “itself” as Śiva then jiva remains as Śiva. This is similar to Navjivan Rastogi’s description of the experience of the self as not a simple act of knowing but as a complex act of re-knowing (Rastogi 1979 : 48). When recognition of self occurs, the limited consciousness merges with the supreme consciousness as “there is no other place for ciṭ to merge other than ciṭ” (v 135). Tirumūlar compares this to space merging with space and light merging with light. Śiva is the grace that helps jiva in this effort (v 202). When this realization occurs, the soul has nothing else to know, no other state to reach except to remain with this awareness (<b>aṛive</b> vadivenṛu aṛinthu irunthén). Tirumūlar says that the eight mystical accomplishments such as anima, mahima are agents through which aṛivu knows itself. When the knowledge about self occurs, the Divine tells the soul that it the “big one” (nee periyāi) (v 2360).|$|E

Here, an overview is provided of the various factors involved in carrier cell migration, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. As tumor cells adjust their properties to evade from the immune system and from anti-tumor therapies, generating oncolytic viruses that target a broader range of tumor cells likely increases the potential of oncolytic viruses too.
