Bangladesh, for example, {{cut the number of}} deaths per live births by almost two thirds from 1990 to 2015. However, the MDG was to reduce it by 75%. According to government data, the figure for 2015 was 181 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The MDG mark was 143 per 100,000. A further reduction of maternal mortality is now part of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.The target of the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is to reduce the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.|$|E

In this work, we obtain analogous progresses for hardware implementations. For this, we use the RNS representation of numbers which is especially well suited for pairing computation in a hardware context. A FPGA implementation is proposed, based on an adaptation of Guillermin’s architecture which computes a pairing in 1. 07 ms. It is 2 times faster than all previous hardware implementations (including ASIC and small characteristic implementations) and almost as fast as best software implementations...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{difficulties}} in testing the hadron models by using the N ∗ parameters extracted from the empirical amplitude analyses of the πN and γN reaction data. As an alternative or perhaps a more advantageous approach, we present a Hamiltonian formulation that can relate the pion production dynamics and the constituent quark models of N ∗ structure. The application of the approach in investigating the ∆ and N ∗ (S 11) excitations is reviewed. It is found that while the ∆ excitation can be described satisfactory, the πN scattering in S 11 channel can not be described by the constituent quark models based on either the one-gluonexchange or one-meson-exchange mechanisms. A phenomenological quark-quark potential has been constructed to reproduce the S 11 amplitude. One of the challenging theoretical problems is to understand the hadron structure within Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD). There exist two different approaches. The most fundamental one is the Lattice QCD calculation. The second one is to develop various QCD-inspired models.

A suppression of the cosmic ray flux at energies above $ 5. 5 x 10 ^{ 19 }$ eV is observed {{at a very high}} level of significance but the origin of this cut-off is not established: it can be due to the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin suppression but it can also reflect the upper limit of particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The key characteristics to be measured on cosmic rays is their composition. Upper limits are set above $ 10 ^{ 18 }$ eV on primary photons and neutrinos and primary cosmic rays are expected to be hadrons. Identifying the precise composition (light or heavy nuclei) will permit to solve the puzzle. It has been proven that the radio signal emitted by the extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays reflects their longitudinal profile and can help in constraining the primary particle.
