5|$|The Swiss Confederacy {{remained}} an independent Reichsstand of the Holy Roman Empire, {{but as it}} wasn't even obliged {{to participate in the}} Imperial Diet, this relation was degraded to a purely formal one that would lose significance throughout the 16th century. However, the Swiss still considered themselves as members of the empire with the status of imperial immediacy; the empire was still considered the foundation of all privileges, rights, or political identity as can be witnessed in the continued use of the imperial insignia. The relations between the Habsburgs and the Confederacy were fully normalized in the Erbeinung of 1511, a renewal of the earlier Ewige Richtung of 1474 and a first Erbeinung of 1477. In that treaty, the Habsburgs finally and officially gave up all their territorial claims of old, and even designated the Confederacy the protecting power of the County of Burgundy. In the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, all members and <b>associate</b> <b>states</b> of the Confederacy would gain official full exemption from the empire and recognition as a national and political entity on their own right.|$|E
25|$|The Tagsatzung was the {{confederation}} council, typically meeting {{several times}} a year. Each canton delegated two representatives (including the <b>associate</b> <b>states,</b> which had no vote). The canton where the delegates met initially chaired the gathering, but during the 16th century Zürich permanently assumed the chair (Vorort) and Baden became the seat. The Tagsatzung dealt with inter-cantonal affairs and was the court of last resort in disputes between member states, imposing sanctions on dissenting members. It also administered the condominiums; the reeves were delegated for two years, each time by a different canton.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{stability}} of the secondary structure of particular peptide regions {{is often used to}} investigate the involvement of the region in protein folding. When analysing the relatively small populations of <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> that are formed by weak interactions (i. e. those interactions that are comparable to thermal energies), it is common practice to characterise the <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> by a parameter that is measured when this state is highly occupied. The accuracy of this method, however, has not yet been determined. Results: Using as a model the vancomycin group of antibiotics, either forming dimers or binding to cell wall precursors, we have investigated the dependence of the limiting (i. e. fully associated) chemical shifts of two protons on the equilibrium constants for the formation of the fully <b>associated</b> <b>states.</b> The chemical shift shows a large variation with the equilibrium constant for the formation of the fully <b>associated</b> <b>state.</b> Conclusions: The results demonstrate, in two systems, that a parameter representing a fully <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> (chemical shift) varies greatly with the equilibrium constant for the formation of that <b>associated</b> <b>state.</b> The results have implications for two-state analyses of populations of protein fragments in which a parameter representing the fully <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> is taken to be independent of the equilibrium constant for its formation. Using two-state analysis to determine the population of <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> of protein fragments could result in an underestimation of the population of these <b>associated</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

50|$|A formal {{association}} existed {{under the}} Associated Statehood Act 1967 between the United Kingdom {{and the six}} West Indies <b>Associated</b> <b>States.</b> These were former British colonies in the Caribbean: Antigua (1967-1981), Dominica (1967-1978), Grenada (1967-1974), Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla (1967-1983), Saint Lucia (1967-1979), and Saint Vincent (1969-1979). Under this arrangement, each state had full control over its constitution. The United Nations never determined whether these <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> had achieved a full measure of self-government {{within the meaning of}} the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. Within a few years after the status of <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> was created, all six of the former <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> requested and were granted full independence, except for Anguilla within the former St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla union, which separated from the <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> before independence and remains a United Kingdom dependent territory.|$|R

50|$|The UAE has {{the status}} in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie as an {{observer}} state, and Qatar has the {{status in the}} organization as an associate state. However, in both countries French is not spoken by almost any {{of the general population}} or migrant workers, but spoken by a small minority of those who invest in Francophone countries or have other financial or family ties. Their entrance as observer and <b>associate</b> <b>states</b> respectively into the organisation was aided a good deal by their investments into the Organisation and France itself. A country's status as an observer state in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie gives the country the right to send representatives to organization meetings and make formal requests to the organization but they do not have voting rights within the OIF. A country's status as an associate state also does not give a country voting abilities but <b>associate</b> <b>states</b> can discuss and review organization matters.|$|E

50|$|The Streamlined Sales Tax Project's amnesty {{program has}} caused {{a broad array of}} {{businesses}} to register using the SST system.

Registration in <b>associate</b> <b>states</b> was required within one year of those states becoming full members. This amnesty had several limits. It only applied to sales and use taxes from the seller in its capacity as a seller, not to such taxes due from the seller its capacity as a buyer. Taxes other than sales and uses taxes were not covered by this amnesty. Amnesty did not apply to any matters for which the seller had received an audit notice.|$|E
