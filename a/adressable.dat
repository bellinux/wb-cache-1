40|$|Objective {{of these}} four first {{chapters}} {{is to have a}} complete understanding of the supramolecular organisation of several complementary modules able to form 2 -D networks first in solution using optical spectroscopy measurements as function of solvent polarity, concentration and temperature, and then on solid surface using microscopy techniques such as STM, AFM and TEM. The last chapter presents another type of supramolecular material for application in solar cells technology involving fullerenes and OPV systems. We describes the photoinduced energy and electron process using transient absorption experiments. All these systems provide an exceptional example for the potential of the supramolecular approach {{as an alternative to the}} restricted lithographic method for the fabrication of <b>adressable</b> molecular devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} sub-picosecond {{initialization}} {{of a single}} heavy hole spin in a self-assembled quantum dot with > 98. 5 % fidelity and without external magnetic field. Using an optically <b>adressable</b> charge and spin storage device we tailor the relative electron and hole tunneling escape timescales from the dot and simultaneously achieve high-fidelity initialization, long hole storage times and high efficiency readout via a photocurrent signal. We measure electric field-dependent Rabi oscillations of the neutral and charged exciton transitions in the ultrafast tunneling regime and demonstrate that tunneling induced dephasing (TID) of excitonic Rabi rotations is the major source for the intensity damping of Rabi oscillations in the low Rabi frequency, low temperature regime. Our results are in very good quantitative agreement with quantum-optical simulations revealing that TID {{can be used to}} precisely measure tunneling escape times and extract changes in the Coulomb binding energies for different charge configurations of the quantum dot. Finally, we demonstrate that for sub-picosecond electron tunneling escape TID of a coherently driven exciton transition facilitates ultrafast hole spin initialization with near-unity fidelity...|$|E
40|$|Studies of nanoparticle-based optical matter {{have only}} {{considered}} spherical constituents. Yet nanoparticles with other shapes {{are expected to}} have different local electromagnetic field distributions and therefore interactions with neighbors in optical matter arrays. Therefore, one would expect their dynamics to be different as well. We investigate directed-assembly of ordered arrays of plasmonic nanoplatelets in optical line traps demonstrating reconfigurability of the array by altering the phase gradient via holographic beam shaping. The weaker gradient forces on and resultant slower motion of the nanoplatelets as compared with plasmonic nanospheres allows precise study of their assembly and disassembly dynamics. Both temporal and spatial correlations are detected between particles separated by some hundreds of nanometers to several microns. Electrodynamics simulations reveal the presence of multipolar plasmon modes that induce short range (near-field) and longer range electrodynamic interactions. These interactions cause both the strong correlations and the non-uniform dynamics observed. Our findings demonstrate new opportunities to generate complex <b>adressable</b> optical matter by exploiting interference between mutipolar plamon modes and create novel active optical technology...|$|E
40|$|En: Semiconductor Lasers and Laser Dynamics II; Daan Lenstra, Markus Pessa, Ian H. WhiteWe have {{theoretically}} {{investigated the}} bifurcation scenario {{that leads to}} the emergence of a bistable regime in a two-mode model for a Semiconductor Ring Laser. The bistability takes place between two quasi-unidirectional solutions for the electric field, which are selected as stable solutions via gain-crossaturation, for well-above threshold operating conditions. Furthermore, we analyzed the switching properties of a single Semiconductor Ring Laser (SRL) operating in the bistable regime, under coherent optical pulse injection, in view of the possible implementation of a single SRL an optically <b>adressable</b> memory element. The result is that the response time and the minimum switching energy respectively attain values the order of a few tenth of ps, and 1 fJ. Those values are espected to scale down with the device radius, due to the consequent decreasing of the cavity flight time. We have observed that the fast switching dynamic is due to an energy redistribution process between the two counterpropagating modes, that does not involve the (slow) carrier density through field-medium energy exchange processes. This allows to attain time scales much faster than the typical limit represented by the inverse of relaxation oscillation frequency.
