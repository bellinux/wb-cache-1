5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} {{is most effective}} early {{in the course of}} infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox.

5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land.

By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E

5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E

5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> {{corrosion}} have been exploited {{in a number}} of related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> corrosion in hot water.|$|E

By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> treatment.

5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, <b>and</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> air flow in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume.
