2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E

50|$|More recently, two {{measures}} have been introduced, and one has been proposed, to prohibit discrimination in employment based on <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> patterns, for employees who are not considered permanent. The Part-time Workers Regulations and the Fixed-term Employee Regulations were partly introduced to remedy the pay gap between men and women. The reason is, women {{are far more likely}} to be doing non-full-time permanent jobs. However following the Treaty of Amsterdam, a new Article 13 promised Community action to remedy inequalities generally. The abortive Agency Workers Directive was meant to be the third pillar in this programme. Discrimination against union members is also a serious problem, for the obvious reason that some employers view unionisation as threat to their right to manage.|$|E

Instead, the Missa presents a continuous musical narrative, almost without repetition, particularly in the Gloria and Credo, the two longest movements. The style, Adorno has noted, is close to treatment of themes in imitation that one finds in the Flemish masters such as Josquin des Prez and Johannes Ockeghem, but it is unclear whether Beethoven was consciously imitating their techniques to meet the peculiar demands of the Mass text.

Observed differences between the various working arrangements are starkest when we do not account for unobserved individual heterogeneity.

40|$|Across many countries, {{the rise}} of <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> has been noted whereby {{employees}} are increasingly in less secure contractual situations. While this might lead to more flexible labour markets, there are potential downsides for individuals. We explore the prevalence of <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> in Ireland which provides a fascinating case-study. Ireland experienced a dramatic deterioration in its labour market around the Great Recession with unemployment rising from 4. 8 percent in 2007 to 15 percent in 2012. This situation was also reversed somewhat quickly with unemployment falling to 8 percent by 2016. Such dramatic swings provide {{the context in which}} we explore whether <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> increased for new job holders with the onset of recession and whether or not this weakened as the economy recovered. We find that <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> did increase with the recession and, although moderating, the likelihood of new jobs being atypical persisted into the recovery.

40|$|In {{defining}} <b>atypical</b> <b>work,</b> {{this paper}} encompasses part-time work, casual and temporary work, outwork/homework/telework and small self-employment. All three national social security systems are very selective and inflexible in protecting {{these forms of}} work as they are modeled according to the dominant pattern of full-time, continuous employment. As <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> is women's work, it is also regulated by social security benefits for {{the other part of}} women's work-domestic work. Family benefits have a very ambiguous function. They provide some means to escape from private dependency and they sometimes even recognize domestic work as insured normal labor market work. On the other side, they were also intended to subsidize the low wages of marginal work and allow only for a small amount of paid work, especially <b>atypical</b> <b>work,</b> while on benefit. Thus, they also structured and sustained the segmentation of labor market work and domestic work. Copyright 1993 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{labour market}} is the European leader in {{part-time}} employment. Both {{for men and women}} the incidence of part-time work is higher than in most other European countries.

30|$|Turning to an {{empirical}} operationalization of labour market duality, {{the character of}} non-standard or <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> can be described along different dimensions of deviation from a ‘standard’ or ‘typical’ job.

The distance from a standard job measured by differentials regarding employment stability and pay is therefore to be seen as one dimension of <b>atypical</b> <b>work,</b> whereas the chance of moving to a standard job is a distinct second important aspect.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a Nature {{paper by}} Gonzalez-Maeso and colleagues (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) {{reported}} that two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are targeted by antipsychotic drugs, the serotonin 5-HT2AR and the glutamate mGlu2R receptors, {{come together to}} form a complex that is deregulated in schizophrenic patients.

According to the authors, <b>atypical</b> antipsychotics <b>work</b> through this receptor complex (5-HT2AR/ mGlu2R) and signal quite differently through the complex compared to how they signal through one or the other receptor alone. The signaling through the receptor complex could predict whether a drug would act as an antipsychotic or a pro-psychotic (e.g. the hallucinogen drug LSD).|$|R

30|$|When {{trying to}} explain the pattern of labour market duality {{discussed}} above, we can argue that besides structural change and strategic behaviour of market actors, in particular employers, labour market institutions and reforms {{play a major role}} in shaping the functioning of the German labour market, specifically regarding <b>atypical</b> <b>work.</b> While there is major stability around the institutional provisions governing standard employment contracts, there have been major structural changes mainly affecting non-standard or ‘atypical’ jobs.

40|$|<b>Atypical</b> <b>work</b> forms – such as {{independent}} contracting, on-call, or temporary work – {{have been criticized}} as providing employment that is more precarious than that offered by regular (open-ended) employment. One of the concerns attached to these work forms is that they allow employers to evade labor market protections afforded to regular workers. In such cases, we {{might be expected to}} see a greater prevalence of atypical workers in those states with greater labor market protections. We test for this possibility using Current Population Survey data from 1995 to 2005. Our results would suggest that at least one form of <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> – contracting and consulting work – is less likely to be observed in right-to-work states after controlling for state-level characteristics. ...|$|E

We then describe the different forms of <b>atypical</b> <b>work</b> and their development since the 1980 s. It is necessary to establish which individuals are particularly affected. Then we discuss {{the extent to which}} the individual forms are not just atypical but also precarious. Finally, we offer further reflections on the concept of flexicurity...|$|E

30|$|This {{leads to}} the crucial role of firms in {{explaining}} the role of non-standard employment types and factors related to structural shifts in labour demand based on skills, technology and structural change. One can argue that firms will always try to use the most flexible employment option available and the lowest wage possible to employ workers, depending on the demand and supply of labour with the required skills profile (Osterman 1987). Hence, firms hiring decisions make a strong difference in the actual relevance of <b>atypical</b> and low-pay <b>work.</b> Long-term oriented standard contracts will be more resilient in occupations where long tenure {{is seen as a}} necessary precondition for productive employment due to skill requirements and expertise, i.e. where workers are not easily replaceable.|$|R
