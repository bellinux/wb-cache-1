5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E

25|$|During {{the recent}} history of the grindadráp, the tools of the catch have modernized. Cellular {{telephones}} and radio allow the islands to be alerted to a sighting within the course of minutes. The use of private motorboats gives the whalers more speed and maneuverability on the water. The dull blowhole hook, adopted in response to concerns over cruelty, had the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of further increasing the effectiveness of Faroese attempting to beach the whales. In spite of how such improvements to the tools could make the grindadráp more effective, the number of pilot whales caught, both overall and per whale drive, is less than in preceding centuries.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol ratio: This ratio {{compares the}} levels of LDL to HDL. Trans fat behaves like {{saturated}} fat by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat. (Higher ratios are worse.) One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans fat rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.|$|E
25|$|Muldoon {{initially}} opposed indirect consumer taxation on {{the basis}} that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10–20% taxes {{on a wide range of}} goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective and a quick means of raising more revenue for the government without any accompanying fundamental reform of the taxation system – there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to indirect taxation. The immediate result of the boat and caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inherent}} land shortage in Kyrgyzstan is {{exacerbated by}} the flooding of agricultural areas for hydroelectric projects. The creation of Toktogul Reservoir on the Naryn River, for example, involved the flooding of 130km² of fertile land. Such projects have the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of constricting downstream water supply; Toktogul deprives the lower reaches of the Syr Darya in Uzbekistan and the Aral Sea Basin of substantial amounts of water. Because the Naryn Basin, where many hydroelectric projects are located, is very active seismically, flooding is also a danger should a dam be broken by an earthquake.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Linus Pauling {{proposed}} an <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> called [...] "back bonding" [...] {{to account for}} the smaller experimental values compared to the theory. His model predicts that F donates electrons into a vacant atomic orbital in the atom it is bonded to, giving the bonds a certain amount of sigma bond character. In addition, the fluorine atom also receives a certain amount of pi electron density back from the central atom giving rise to double bond character through (p-p)π or (p-d)π [...] "back bonding". Thus, this model suggests that the observed shortening of the lengths of bonds is due to these double bond characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{problems}} such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage.

While there are reports of the [...] "hallucinogenic" [...] or [...] "hypnotic" [...] properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the formatio reticularis. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol.|$|E

Whenever a person got {{the ball in the}} basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game. The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of allowing rebound shots.

2500|$|The Terrain Awareness Warning System (abbreviated TAWS, {{although}} more correctly {{referred to as}} an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System or EGPWS) fired its first audible warning [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, {{was not in the}} system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport. Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the <b>additional</b> <b>effect</b> of silencing the warning. The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly. As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to , twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately [...] higher than specified.|$|E
