5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported <b>agricultural</b> <b>implements</b> and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Agricultural</b> <b>implement</b> {{and working}} object to {{maintain}} {{the stability of the}} operating height can improve the quality and efficiency. To provide accurate operating height between implement and working objects, this paper proposes a kind of <b>agricultural</b> <b>implement</b> operating height measurement method based on 20 Scanning Laser Range Finder (20 -SLRF). Methods: The row information that obtained by 20 -SLRF scanning vertical is corrected using an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). Then, the data is analysed based on mode principle, and different distance level sets are collected. The weighted fusion algorithm is used to calculate the <b>agricultural</b> <b>implement</b> operating height. Results: The test results show that the 20 -SLRF is mounted at 1510 mm height position, the identification object (ground) accounting for more than 30. 35 %, the RMS error is 12. 15 mm, the maximum error is 19 mm; the 20 -SLRF is mounted at 1880 mm height position, the identification object (ground) accounting for more than 29. 61 %, the RMS error is 4. 32 mm, the maximum error is 15 mm. Discussions: The method can accurately extract the relative height of the water surface of paddy field and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>implement,</b> the measuring error less than ± 20 mm. Conclusion: The paper provides a new method for the precise levelling of paddy field...|$|R
