40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} first comprehensive study ever undertaken of Handel's <b>accompanied</b> recitatives. It traces {{the evolution of the}} medium within his vocal works from 1704 up until the composer's final English language works in the 1750 s. Using music manuscripts, wordbooks, the early printed editions and documentary evidence a detailed picture of Handel' s musical and dramatic choices relating to his <b>accompanied</b> recitatives comes into view. The principle singers for whom Handel's <b>accompanied</b> recitatives were originally written and the differences between <b>accompanied</b> recitatives in acted and un-acted works are discussed in detail, and possible influences on the young Handel, with regard to <b>accompanied</b> recitative, are also considered. The connection between <b>accompanied</b> recitative and the supernatural in the composer's vocal works is also discussed, and his use of <b>accompanied</b> recitative to distort closed forms and his reasons for doing so are explored. The problems relating to the terminology of eighteenth-century <b>accompanied</b> recitative are discussed at length, and a history of the medium is provided.
