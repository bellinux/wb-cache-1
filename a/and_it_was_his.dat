5|$|Biden became ranking {{minority}} {{member of}} the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981. In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> most important legislative accomplishment {{at that point in}} time. He first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.|$|E
5|$|During the Invasion of the Waikato, his militia {{unit was}} mobilised <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> conduct at Paterangi, where he rescued British {{soldiers}} under fire, that saw him awarded the VC. He {{was the first}} recipient of the VC to be a non-regular soldier. After his military service ended, Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell. From 1870 to 1881, he held a variety of civil service positions but his health declined and he moved to Queensland, in Australia, seeking a better climate in which to recover.

5|$|South Africa {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the origins of Scouting. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the movement, spent most of the years from 1884 to 1905 as a soldier in Southern Africa. South Africa's most prominent role in the origin of Scouting was the Siege of Mafeking in 1899–1900. Baden-Powell successfully lead the defense of the town for 217days. During the siege, he was inspired by the boys of the Mafeking Cadet Corps, and later used them as an example of bravery in the first chapter of his handbook Scouting for Boys. The Mafeking Cadets are not regarded as the first Boy Scouts, as Scouting was only born later, in 1907 at Brownsea Island in Britain. However, it was Mafeking that resulted in Baden-Powell becoming a national hero in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> fame that enabled his Scout movement to catch on so rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{knee injury}} flared {{again in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley after England elected to bat. On the first morning, England opener Len Hutton edged Toshack through the slips and was then dropped on 25. Hutton {{eventually}} reached 81 as the opening pair put on 168. Toshack was wicketless as the hosts closed the first day at 2/268. The following morning, he {{was removed from the}} attack after night-watchman Bedser hit him for three consecutive fours. After the lunch break, Toshack bowled Jack Crapp with an inside-edged half volley for five to leave England at 5/447. Toshack ended with an ineffective 1/112 from 35 overs as England made 496. He was the most expensive and uneconomical of the frontline bowlers <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> most uneconomical performance in the Tests. He aggravated his knee injury and was later taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his bowling duties for the match and his Test career.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, Davis {{began the}} season with a 50-point, 16-rebound, 7-steal (career high), 5-assist, 4-block {{performance}} against the Denver Nuggets. He was one block short of his first five-by-five. It was the first 50-point, 15-rebound, 5-assist, 5-steal performance in NBA history since steals became an officially recorded statistic in the 1973–74 season. His 50-point night was the second highest scoring output of his career and was the most by any NBA player in a season opener since Michael Jordan scored 54 points in 1989.

On January 27, he had 16 points and tied a career high with 22 rebounds in a 119–103 win over the San Antonio Spurs.

Davis scored 40 for the sixth time this season, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> highest scoring game since he put up 45 against Minnesota on November 23. On February 19, 2017, playing on his team's home floor for the NBA All-Star Game, Davis notched 52 points and 10 rebounds, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's previous All-Star record high of 42 points, and also won the game's Most Valuable Player award. On March 11, 2017, Davis scored 46 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a 125–122 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. On March 31, 2017, Davis had 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks in a 117–89 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game, Davis became the first player in Pelicans history to reach 2,000 points in a season. Following the season, he edged out Rudy Gobert as the center on the All-NBA first team. He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the second time.|$|E

25|$|During the High Renaissance, {{concepts}} {{derived from}} classical antiquity were developed and used with greater surety. The most representative architect is Bramante (1444–1514) who expanded {{the applicability of}} classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His San Pietro in Montorio (1503) was directly inspired by circular Roman temples. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Antonio's brother Francesco had {{sided with}} the Spanish and split the {{conclave}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> negotiations that resulted in Pamphili's election. The final deal in Pamphili's favour included an agreement, designed by the brothers for their own benefit, that the new Pope would allow the Barberini to keep the titles, land and fortunes they had amassed under Pope Urban VIII's reign. Mazarin became so angry because of Antonio's attitude that he deprived him of the protectorate of the Kingdom of France. However, the conflict was of short duration and both cardinals quickly reconciled with each other.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Momentum {{gained a}} new boss when Theodore Shackley {{transferred}} {{in as the}} CIA's Chief of Station in Laos. Shackley is credited with stating that Momentum was run like a country store, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> job {{to turn it into}} a supermarket. An ad hoc U.S. Air Force unit called the Raven Forward Air Controllers was founded to direct the swelling tide of airpower being unleashed in support of the Hmong and other irregulars. Rather than continuing to craft a strategy to defend Laos, the new emphasis in the war became the support of the combat in South Vietnam.|$|E
