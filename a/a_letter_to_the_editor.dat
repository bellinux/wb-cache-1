5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, {{and stated that}} he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status {{as a work of}} art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{uses for}} the land {{included}} a soccer stadium, an indoor tennis facility for Belmont University, public tennis courts, rodeo grounds, a Kroger grocery store, and a neighborhood park. In <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> of The Tennessean, former Sounds owner Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lack baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other proposals and ideas for the space.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> in Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, {{it was suggested}} that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used bolts to climb the Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, {{it was the first time}} bolts were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E

5|$|The Nordland Line {{was first}} {{publicly}} proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen in <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he {{argued for a}} railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland. The same year, Nord-Trøndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos. The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875, who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line, which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard Øverland, made a new proposal. However, {{it was not until}} 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and sent <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, {{died at the age of}} twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E
