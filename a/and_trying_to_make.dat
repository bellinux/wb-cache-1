He recalled his parents being [...] "pretty religious" [...] <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{him go to}} Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. On Dweezil's birth certificate, Frank wrote [...] "musician" [...] for [...] "father's religion". Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government {{was in danger of}} becoming a [...] "fascist theocracy".|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E

It's about understanding it <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

500|$|Broussard {{reported}} in a January 2006 interview that many of Duke Nukem Forevers elements had been finished; [...] "we're just basically pulling it all together <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it fun". Later that year Broussard demonstrated samples of the game, including an early level, a vehicle sequence, and a few test rooms. Among the features seen was the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails. The developer seemed contrite and affected by the long delays; while a journalist demoed the game Broussard referenced note cards and constantly apologized {{for the state of}} the game. In filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Take-Two revealed they had renegotiated the Duke Nukem Forever deal, with the former publisher receiving $4.25million instead of $6million on release of the game. Take-Two offered a $500,000 bonus if Duke Nukem Forever was commercially released by December 31, 2006. However, Broussard denied the rumors that DNF would be released, saying that 3D Realms never cared for or asked for the bonus. He stated that he would [...] "never ship a game early." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.|$|E
500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour {{in support of the}} album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} be sitting in some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E

500|$|Choosing to self-title the album, Lazzara said: [...] "We haven’t had , {{and going}} back to the {{original}} lineup, it seems appropriate." [...] Nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're onto something. It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When I Let You Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which comes across as a [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{picked the}} song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, while Jason Lipshut of Billboard praised the track for [...] "demonstrat Grande's newfound {{maturity}} and ambition." [...] Rob Copsey wrote for the Official Charts Company that 'One Last Time' [...] "suits her better than you’d think, [...] the singer reign in her powerful pipes on this breezy and wistful club track." [...] while Anne Zaleski of The A.V. Club thought the song [...] "channels a more powerful version of On The 6-era Jennifer Lopez," [...] also calling it an [...] "electronica-dusted [...]" [...] AXS's Lucas Villa praised her performance for [...] "exud sincerity and grace" [...] and added that [...] "his baby-come-back tune showcases a softer side to the singer that highlights her dulcet vocals." [...] FDRMX writer John Mychal Feraren gave [...] "One Last Time" [...] a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "an excellent addition to her list of hit songs" [...] and claiming that [...] "its astounding musical production is effortlessly matched by [...] singer's sultry voice [...] transform an empty song into a masterpiece." [...] PPcorn.com went out to describe the song as [...] "an excellent addition to her list of hit songs", declaring: [...] "after the lyrical ambivalence of 'Love Me Harder', here comes a song that actually means something. It's about admitting your shortcomings in a previous relationship, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for it. However, doesn't it sound a bit pathetic when your ex-lover tells you, 'Need {{to be the one who}} takes you home / One more time / I promise after that, I'll let you go.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The Bonfire of the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 2016, {{the band}} {{released}} the second single from the album, [...] "Moth into Flame", {{along with a}} music video. The album's third single, [...] "Atlas, Rise!", was released on October 31, 2016, with a music video composed of footage from the album's recording process. Ulrich also told The Straits Times that same day that the band would be filming music videos for all twelve tracks on the album, using YouTube as their platform. [...] "Now that YouTube is the world's biggest television station, we figured we may as well knock a video out for every song... the practicality of shooting twelve music videos is kind of crazy, especially when you're trying to promote your record, and you're all over the place, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure it doesn't leak. It's crazy but, at the same time, fun". On November 12, 2016, a local Walmart started selling the album {{in advance of the}} official release date of November 18. On November 16, the music videos for all nine remaining tracks (along with [...] "Lords of Summer") were released. The Italian city of Matera appears in the music video for [...] "Spit Out the Bone".|$|E
2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close to your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E

2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E
