40|$|The STriatal-Enriched protein {{tyrosine}} Phosphatase (STEP) is a brain-specific phosphatase whose dysregulation in expression and/or {{activity is}} associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. We recently showed that long-term excessive consumption of ethanol induces a sustained inhibition of STEP activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of mice. We further showed that down-regulation of STEP expression in the DMS, {{and not in the}} adjacent dorsolateral striatum, increases ethanol intake, suggesting that the inactivation of STEP in the DMS contributes to the development of ethanol drinking behaviors. Here, we compared the consequence of global deletion of the STEP gene on voluntary ethanol intake to the consumption of an appetitive rewarding substance (saccharin) or an aversive solution (quinine or denatonium). Whereas saccharin intake was similar in STEP knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) littermate mice, the consumption of ethanol as well as quinine and denatonium was increased in STEP KO mice. These results suggested that the aversive taste of these substances was masked upon deletion of the STEP gene. We therefore hypothesized that STEP contributes to the physiological avoidance towards aversive stimuli. To further test this hypothesis, we measured the responses of STEP KO and WT mice to lithium-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA) and found that whereas WT mice developed lithium place aversion, STEP KO mice did not. In contrast, conditioned place preference (CPP) to ethanol was similar in both genotypes. Together, our results indicate that STEP contributes, at least in part, to the protection against the ingestion of <b>aversive</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective. Introduce the {{different}} approaches being utilized in designing abuse deterrent medications. Background. Abuse and misuse of prescription medications is a growing problem threatening public health. To combat this increase, novel drug formulations have recently been developed and are now becoming available as treatment options. Methods. An online search for relevant literature and formulation strategies was first conducted using the online database Embase. Next, a search for issued patents on abuse deterrent formulation methods was performed using PatFT from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. For the most up to date information, press releases and product innovators websites were reviewed for additional data. Results. Overall, two different formulation approaches were identified and labeled as (1) physical approaches and (2) chemical approaches. Physical approaches are designs having mechanical characteristic that prevent physical tampering. They were sub-categorized further based on their formulation as solids, gels, or non-intentional type products. Chemical approaches typically use the addition {{of one or more}} non-active ingredient(s) into the formulation to deter abuse. Other chemical methods involve modifications to the drug structure itself to produce prodrugs. The chemical approach types were labeled as agonist/antagonist, <b>aversive</b> <b>agents,</b> or metabolics. Conclusion. We found most formulations used a combination of approaches and utilized proprietary technologies from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Prodrug and agonist/antagonist formulations have been used in past, while solid and gel approaches are more common innovations in recent drug products. The effectiveness of these innovative formulations to deter abuse in the general population is yet to be determined. Grants...|$|R
40|$|Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a {{significant}} pest species threatening the survival of endangered and vulnerable native Australian fauna. Lethal baiting with the toxin 1080 is currently the most widely implemented form of control. However, non-target uptake is a problem, even in Western Australia where most native species have a high 1080 tolerance. It reduces the number of baits available to foxes and therefore the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of 1080 fox baiting operations. To investigate bait presentation {{and the use of}} <b>aversive</b> tastant <b>agents</b> as potential techniques to reduce non-target uptake of 1080 baits, two separate studies were conducted. Study 1 examined different non-toxic meat bait presentations to find the presentation that had the lowest non-target uptake. Baits were laid on the surface, suspended, buried or wrapped in kangaroo hide. Study 2 investigated the effectiveness of potential deterrents in causing aversion both immediately and accumulatively over time. Nine different deterrents (washing-up liquid, citric acid, wasabi, baking powder, bicarbonate soda, salt, sodium saccharin, Bitrex and chilli) were tested for immediate aversion and chilli and Bitrex were tested for accumulative aversion. A cafeteria-style presentation was used, with deterrents applied to apple baits of control, low and high concentrations. For Study 1 and 2 animal activity and bait take were monitored on remote-sensing Reconyx cameras for later photo analysis. The results of Study 1 suggested no significant effect of bait presentation. However, as hypothesised the longevity and non-target uptake was lowest for buried baits. Study 2 suggested that salt, wasabi and chilli created immediate aversion in the most abundant non-target species, quokkas. However, aversion was only carried-over onto untreated apple baits in wasabi and chilli. These findings suggest that bait presentation and the use of <b>aversive</b> tastant <b>agents</b> may have potential to decrease non-target uptake and be employed in future baiting 1080 fox baiting operations...|$|R

During the nestling and early fledgling stages, juvenile finches raised by adults that avoided oats received 30 – 40 times less exposure to hulled oats than did juveniles raised by adults that ate oats. After they were separated from the adults, the juveniles had no further access to oats or to canary seed, the alternative untreated food, until tested individually at 10 – 12, 20 – 22, and 35 – 38 weeks of age. There was no relationship between the juvenile birds ’ exposure to oats in the early nestling stage and their subsequent oat preference scores. Birds raised by adults that avoided oats during the late nestling and fledgling stages, however, displayed lower oat preference scores than did birds raised by adults that ate oats.

40|$|The {{majority}} of species are under predatory risk {{in their natural}} habitat and targeted by predators {{as part of the}} food web. Through the process of evolution by natural selection manifold mechanisms have emerged to avoid predation. As Fisher argued, it is the ubiquitous presence of anti-predator adaptations which shows that predation plays {{a significant role in the}} ecology and evolution of ecosystems. These ecosystems are intrinsically complex which derives from the high entanglement of organisms interacting in competitive relationships: the prey is part of the predator’s environment and vice versa. As a result, the evolution of predator and prey is best described as a co-evolutionary process of predator-prey systems. It is common to classify anti-predator adaptations into ‘primary defences’ and ‘secondary defences’. Primary defences operate before an attack by reducing the frequency of detection or encounter with predators. Secondary defences, which are used after a predator has initiated prey-catching behaviour, commonly involve the expression of toxins or deterrent substances which are not observable by the predator. Hence, the possession of such secondary defence in many prey species comes with a specific signal of that defence. This pairing of a toxic secondary defence and a conspicuous primary defence is known as aposematism. Previous models mainly focused on questions of the initial evolution of aposematism in ancestrally cryptic populations. However, the field has a renewed interest in questions beyond the initial evolution of aposematism such as: how conspicuous should a signal be, and how much should be invested into secondary defence? Moreover, which factors influence evolutionary stability of aposematic solutions. Within this context, the role of co-evolution and the mechanisms of aversive learning are at the heart of the current research. On the one hand, to explain stability and persistence of aposematic signals requires a theory of co-evolution of defence and signals. On the other hand, the role of the predator and details of the predator’s aversive learning process gained renewed interest of the field. As the selective <b>agent,</b> <b>aversive</b> learning is an important aspect of predator avoidance and of the co-evolution of predator-prey systems. In the first chapter, this thesis will review the literature on aposematism and introduce the different selective pressures acting on aposematic prey. The thesis will then identify open questions of interest around aposematism. In the second chapter the thesis will focus on the perspective of the prey. The introduction of a game theoretical model of co-evolution of defence and signal will be followed by an adaptation of the model for finite populations. In finite populations, investigating the co-evolution of defence and signalling requires an understanding of natural selection as well as an assessment of the effects of drift as an additional force acting on stability. In the third chapter the thesis will adopt the perspective of the predator. It will introduce reinforcement learning as an normative framework of rational decision making in a changing environment. An analysis of the consequences of aposematism in combination with aversive learning on the predator’s diet and energy intake will be followed by a lifetime model of optimal foraging behaviour in the presence of aposematic prey in the fourth chapter. In the last chapter I will conclude that the predator’s aversive learning process plays a crucial role in the form and stability of aposematism. The introduction of temporal difference learning allows for a better understanding of the specific details of the predator’s role in aposematism and presents a way to take the discipline forward...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} goats {{to learn to}} avoid flavored alfalfa hay enriched with oxalic acid was {{investigated}} in an indoor choice experiment. In addition, the influence of rumen adaptation to oxalic acid {{on the strength of}} avoidance behavior was studied. The experiment consisted of four nine-day conditioning periods during which 24 goats were fed hay with or without added oxalic acid for two-day bouts in sequence. Sensory differences between the hays were emphasized by incorporating artificial flavors (fenugreek vs. apple). Half the goats were adapted to oxalic acid by daily oral administration of 0. 6 mmol/kg live wt/day of free oxalic acid, which successfully generated an active oxalic acid-degrading rumen microbial population. At the end of each conditioning period, short-term preference for the hay diets was measured in 20 -min choice trials. Plasma calcium concentrations were measured during each conditioning period as an indicator of the physiological effect of oxalic acid ingestion. Animals showed a chronic mild hypocalcemia (initial baseline values were 115 mg Ca/dl plasma vs. 89 mg Ca/dl plasma for the mean {{of the rest of the}} samplings during the conditioning phase). Preference for the oxalic acid-containing and the control diets was similar prior to conditioning. During conditioning, preference for the oxalic acid-containing diet was diminished (e. g., preference ratios during third conditioning period averaged 0. 30 for oxalic acid-containing diets and 0. 70 for control diets; P < 0. 05). In preference tests carried out one, three, and five weeks after the last conditioning period, preference progressively returned to preconditioning levels.

This research aimed to induce a conditioned food aversion to Ipomoea carnea var. fistulosa in goats, using B. coridifolia as an <b>aversive</b> <b>agent,</b> and to compare the aversion induced by this plant with the aversion induced by lithium chloride (LiCl). Thirteen goats were allotted into two groups: Group 1 with six goats was averted with 175 mg/kg of body weight of LiCl and Group 2 with seven goats was averted with 0, 25 g/kg of bw of dried B. coridifolia. All goats were averted on day 1 after the ingestion of I. carnea. The aversion procedure with LiCl or B. coridifolia in goats from Groups 1 and 2, respectively, was repeated in those goats that again consumed the plant during tests on days 2, 3, and 7. The goats of both groups were challenged in pens on 23 and 38 days after {{the last day of}} aversion and challenged in the pasture on days 11, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27 and 29 after the last day of aversion. After this period goats were challenged every 15 days on pasture until the 330 º day after the last day of aversion (7 th day). Two goats from Group 1 ingested I. carnea {{on the first day of}} the pasture challenge, 4 days after the last day of aversive conditioning in the pen. In addition, another goat in Group 1 started to consume the plant on day 18, and other two goats ate it on day 20. One goat in Group 1 that had never eaten I. carnea died on day 155. One goat from Group 2 started to ingest I. carnea on the first day of the pasture challenge, and a second goat started to consume this plant on day 182.
