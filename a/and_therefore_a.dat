5|$|To assess {{prospective}} {{wind power}} sites a {{probability distribution function}} is often fit to the observed wind speed data.

5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen <b>and</b> (<b>therefore)</b> <b>a</b> reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) {{realized}} that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E

His activity in Olt is credited with having sparked some violent incidents: in at least one account, he instigated the peasants of Slatina area to riot, and their revolt was only suppressed with use of force. Others however claim that the Romanian Land Forces randomly shot at, then charged upon, the peaceful mass of demonstrators, killing at least 35 of them.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as {{was done in the}} earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> waste of time, but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Opisthocoelicaudia was {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the family Camarasauridae, together with Camarasaurus and Euhelopus. This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka considered Opisthocoelicaudia closer to Euhelopus than to Camarasaurus, placing it in the subfamily Euhelopodinae. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily Camarasaurinae <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> close relative of Camarasaurus. Today, both Euhelopus and Opisthocoelicaudia are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed Opisthocoelicaudia to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family Titanosauridae. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists; instead, the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry has {{a variety}} of causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be). More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E

5|$|The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are {{non-profit}} {{organizations that}} provide funding and other support to off site and on site conservation efforts. The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also {{contribute significantly to}} protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> resistance to certain pests. Bt corn (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the monarch butterfly.|$|E
5|$|The above {{cascade of}} (n,γ) {{reactions}} produces {{a mixture of}} different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the californium isotope 252Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50mg of 248Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces 248Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.|$|E
5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into thinking they had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature {{as to whether or not}} this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a radula comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, operculum and radula, he concluded that L.turturella was simply a morphotype, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> synonym of L.canarium.|$|E

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
5|$|As an American, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> {{citizen of}} a neutral country, Heineman used his {{contacts}} abroad to find overseas sources of food {{which might be}} shipped to Belgium to resupply the populace. Food from abroad being the only viable immediate solution to Belgium's food shortage, the Committee's chief initial difficulty was obtaining {{the permission of the}} British and German governments to import food and in providing guarantees {{that it would not be}} used for military purposes. The CNSA was also supported in its early activities by Charles de Broqueville's Belgian government in exile. The logistical problems involved in coordinating the huge shipments of food to Belgium meant that the CNSA began to look for foreign assistance in procuring and transporting material to Belgium. Francqui used his personal acquaintance with Herbert Hoover, future President of the United States, to create an external body to assist the management of the CNSA. Hoover became the director of the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB), and led successful attempts to raise money abroad in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Belgium. Because the CRB was officially an American organization, the CRB was also necessary to assure that the food, once delivered to the CNSA, was not immediately seized by the Germans. The CRB also provided the international support necessary to convince the British government to permit the shipments. Once received, the food and material from the CRB was distributed through the CNSA's network of 125,000 agents across the country.|$|E
5|$|Each planet or moon has a mass, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>a</b> {{gravitational}} pull, {{though they}} do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player's ship. This sometimes results in odd behavior; for example, the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos. This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon's surface until it is close enough to Phobos's center that Phobos's pull becomes the dominant force, {{at which point the}} ship snaps back to be landed on the surface. The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen. Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty, or an adjustment to the coordinate display system so that, rather than the ship staying {{in the center of the}} screen and the planets moving relative to it, the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen, with the ship moving relative to it.|$|E
