500|$|Several biographers have {{suggested}} {{it likely that}} local traditional customs would have been observed after the birth; in this circumstance, a rooster would have been presented to his parents, while Mao would probably not have been bathed until {{three days after the}} birth, an event which would have been the first culturally-appropriate opportunity for guests to view the child. The child's father was expected to <b>add</b> <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> ginger to the bath water, symbolizing mind and health, while also providing sacrifices to the spirits of the ancestors. A Daoist fortune-teller was then employed to draw up a horoscope for the child, which revealed that he was lacking in the water element; Mao was therefore given the personal name of Zedong because according to Hunanese custom the character of ze ("to anoint") was deemed to correct this deficiency. The character of ze however had a dual meaning; as well as referring to moisture, it also implied kindness and beneficence. [...] Yichang chose the latter part of his son's name, dong ("east"), so that the child's name would mean [...] "benefactor of the east".|$|E

25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{grandson}} Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, {{he and his}} warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This {{was later}} called steak tartare. The city states {{of what is now}} Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by <b>adding</b> capers, <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, the first description of steak tartare was given by Jules Verne in 1875 in his novel Michael Strogoff. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian carpaccio, which itself was invented in 1930 at Harry's Bar in Venice. Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of varying dietary supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic mixture on semen quality characteristics of Koekoek breeder cocks aged 35 - 41 weeks. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. The three dietary supplemental levels based on garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> supplemental inclusion levels were Q 0 (0 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 0 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), Q 1 (2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), and Q 2 (5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed) with each treatment having three replicates. A quadratic type equation was used to determine the <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic levels for optimum semen quality characteristics. Daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased progressive motile cells (%), actual life sperm count (× 106 /nl), and live sperm (%) by 221. 20 %, 301. 51 %, and 352. 43 %, while 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced them by 28. 67 %, 12. 69 %, and 19. 00 %, respectively. However, daily supplementation with 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased sperm count (× 106 /nl) by 12. 82 %, whereas daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced it by 10. 26 % in Koekoek breeder cocks. Dietary <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplemental inclusion levels of 3. 009, 3. 191, 4. 621, 6. 601, 6. 719, 2. 327, 2. 385, and 2. 247 g per 600 g DM feed supported optimum progressive motile cells (%), immotile sperm cells (%), actual dead sperm count (× 106 /nl), actual live sperm count (× 106 /nl), live sperm (%), acrosome morphology defects (%), acrosome detachment (%), and acrosome swelling (%), with probability values ranging from 0. 003 to 0. 783, whereas minimum progressive motile cells (%) increase was achieved at an optimum <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplementation levels of 3. 009 g per 600 g DM feed. These findings have a lot of implications on the use of supplemental <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic inclusion levels to enhance reproductive efficiency in Koekoek breeder cocks...|$|R
