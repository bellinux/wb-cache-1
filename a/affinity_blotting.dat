The technique involves binding of specific antibody to nitrocellulose, separating proteins by isoelectric focusing or zone electrophoresis in agarose gels, using capillary transfer to bind proteins to the nitrocellulose via their anti-body affinity, and then detecting transferred proteins with enzyme-labeled antibody. A monoclonal immunoglobulin can be completely characterized in 2 h. No expensive equipment is required. <b>Affinity</b> <b>blotting</b> is about 10 -fold as sensitive as native blotting, 100 -fold as sensitive as silver staining. Immune fixation {{is generally considered}} more sensitive than immunoelectrophoresis for detecting the presence of monoclonal gammopathies. However, the identification of apparent monoclonal immunoglobulins (mlg’s) can still be difficult when the concentration of the mlg is {{much lower than the}} concentration of the residual Ig’s, because the reaction of the light chain of the mig is obscured by that of the residual Ig’s. ’ Use of native blotting (1), although far more sensitive than immune fixation, does not overcome the problem, because all Ig’s are nonselectively transferred to the membrane. The light-chain types of low-concentration mlg’s can be determined by using <b>affinity</b> <b>blotting</b> (2, 3). The protein in question is bound to a solid-phase support via an affinity ligand. The transferred protein(s) is then detected with specific probes. For mlg analyses, specific antibody directed against appropriate Ig heavy-chain determinants is used as the ligand, bound to a nitrocellulose membrane (NC).

Further evidence for the RNase II-degradosome association came from the binding of RNase II to purified RNaseE in far western <b>affinity</b> <b>blot</b> experiments. Formation of the RNase II–degradosome complex required the degradosomal proteins RhlB and PNPase as well as a C-terminal domain of RNaseE that contains binding sites for the other degradosomal proteins.

Bacteriol. 171 : 6674 - 6679, 1989). To elucidate the nature of collagen binding to YadA, we used a recombinant Yersinia strain expressing the cloned YadA gene. Direct binding of YadA-positive yersiniae to collagens was demonstrated in <b>affinity</b> <b>blot</b> experiments on nitrocellulose filters. A spectrum of collagen types in a wide concentration range were tested {{for their ability to}} block binding of 125 I-labeled collagen type II to YadA-positive yersiniae. The results indicate a specific binding site(s) for YadA in collagen types I, II, III, IV, V, and XI. In contrast, collagen type VI did not bind to YadA. To characterize the binding site(s) more precisely, isolated collagen chains and cyanogen bromide fragments were investigated. These studies revealed that binding of YadA to collagen type I is confined to the alpha 1 (I) chain, whereas the binding site within collagen type XI is localized in the alpha 3 (XI) chain. alpha 2 (I), alpha 1 (XI), and alpha 2 (XI) did not bind to YadA. Most interestingly, in the alpha 1 (II) chain the specific binding site for YadA resides in the cyanogen bromide fragment CB 10. The latter might indicate a binding site that does not depend on conformation. Based on these findings, further fragmentation and the synthesis of peptides may allow definition of the peptide sequence(s) relevant for YadA binding. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the properties of the}} cytoplasmic domain (FlhBC) of the 383 -amino-acid Salmonella membrane protein FlhB, a component of the type III flagellar export apparatus. FlhB, along with the hook-length control protein FliK, mediates the switching of export specificity from rod- and hook-type substrates to filament-type substrates during flagellar morphogenesis. Wild-type FlhBC was unstable (half-life, ca. 5 min), being specifically cleaved at Pro- 270 into two polypeptides, FlhBCN and FlhBCC, which retained the ability to interact with each other after cleavage. Full-length wild-type FlhB was also subject to cleavage. Coproduction of the cleavage products, FlhBΔCC (i. e., the N-terminal transmembrane domain FlhBTM plus FlhBCN) and FlhBCC, resulted in restoration of both motility and flagellar protein export to an flhB mutant host, indicating that the two polypeptides were capable of productive association. Mutant FlhB proteins that can undergo switching of substrate specificity {{even in the absence of}} FliK were much more resistant to cleavage (half-lives, 20 to 60 min). The cleavage products of wild-type FlhBC, existing as a FlhBCN–FlhBCC complex on an <b>affinity</b> <b>blot</b> membrane, bound the rod- and hook-type substrate FlgD more strongly than the filament-type substrate FliC. In contrast, the intact form of FlhBC (mutant or wild type) or the FlhBCC polypeptide alone bound FlgD and FliC to about the same extent. FlhBCN by itself did not bind substrates appreciably. We propose that FlhBC has two substrate specificity states and that a conformational change, mediated by the interaction between FlhBCN and FlhBCC, is responsible for the specificity switching process. FliK itself is an export substrate; its binding properties for FlhBC resemble those of FlgD and do not provide any evidence for a physical interaction beyond that of the export process...|$|R

Using a variation of the acidic hexosaminidase activity assay, we demonstrated an increase in both O-GlcNAcase and lysosomal hexosaminidase activity in breast tumor tissue compared to matched adjacent tissue. Although no clear correlation with tumor grade or type was apparent among the samples examined (12 matched pairs), the increase in O-GlcNAcase and lysosomal hexosaminidase activity in tumor tissue was consistently elevated and statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Protein monoglycosylation was evaluated using immunoblotting, <b>affinity</b> <b>blotting,</b> and radioactive labeling. While the variety of modified proteins was greater in tumor tissue compared to adjacent tissue, the total amount of O-GlcNAc monoglycosylation was significantly decreased in the tumor tissue especially on proteins in the molecular mass range of 45 – 65 kDa.

40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that uses the}} host mononuclear phagocyte as a niche for survival and replication during infection. Complement component C 3 has previously been shown to enhance the binding of M. tuberculosis to mononuclear phagocytes. Using a C 3 ligand <b>affinity</b> <b>blot</b> protocol, we identified a 30 kDa C 3 -binding protein in M. tuberculosis as heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HbhA). HbhA {{was found to be}} a hydrophobic protein that localized to the cell membrane/cell wall fraction of M. tuberculosis, and this protein has previously been shown by others to be located on the surface of M. tuberculosis. The C 3 -binding activity of HbhA was localized to the C-terminus of the protein, which consists of lysine-alanine repeats. Full-length recombinant HbhA coated onto latex beads was shown to mediate the adherence of the beads to murine macrophage-like cells in both a C 3 -dependent and a C 3 -independent manner. An in-frame 576 by deletion in the hbhA gene was created in a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis using a PCR technique known as gene splicing by overlap extension (SOEing). Using the ΔhbhA mutant, HbhA was found not to be necessary for growth of M. tuberculosis in laboratory media or in macrophage-like cells, nor is HbhA required for adherence of M. tuberculosis to macrophage-like cells. HbhA is, however, required for infectivity of M. tuberculosis in mice. Mice infected with the ΔhbhA mutant show decreased growth in the lungs, liver, and spleen compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain. Using the ΔhbhA mutant strain, we were able to purify and identify a second 30 -kDa C 3 -binding protein, HupB. These data demonstrate that HbhA is required for the in vivo but not the in vitro survival of M. tuberculosis and that HbhA is not necessary for the adherence of M. tuberculosis to the macrophage-like cells used in these studies. The expression of two proteins that bind human C 3 may aid in the efficient binding of M. tuberculosis to complement receptors for uptake into mononuclear cells, or may influence other aspects of the host-parasite interaction. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{evidence}} that insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) influences certain properties of H 4 IIE hepatoma cells independent of insulin {{led us to}} examine whether H 4 IIE cells express IGF- 1 receptors. Competitive binding experiments demonstrated IGF- 1, but not insulin or IGF-II, could compete with [125 I]IGF- 1. Chemical crosslinking detected a protein with an apparent mass of 175 kDa and its identity as the IGF- 1 receptor α-subunit was confirmed by Western blotting. The apparent molecular mass of this protein decreased to 135 kDa following deglycosylation. Immunofluorescence microscopy verified that both insulin and IGF- 1 receptors were present, although measurement of IGF- 1 receptor quantity revealed they were less abundant than insulin receptors. Binding of IGF- 1 was low in growing cells and higher in a quiescent cell population. Scatchard analysis confirmed that receptor density was increased in non-growing H 4 IIE cells while there was no apparent difference in receptor <b>affinity.</b> Western <b>blot</b> analysis and RT-PCR revealed that both protein and mRNA levels were elevated as cell growth ceased. Interestingly, addition of insulin to quiescent H 4 IIE cells, which stimulates cell proliferation, further increased IGF- 1 receptor protein levels with a peak at 12 – 24 h. Distinct modes of regulating IGF- 1 receptor expression are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) free light {{chains of}} κ or λ (FLC κ/λ) type were {{investigated}} by <b>affinity</b> mediated <b>blotting</b> technique (AMI) and ELISA in 28 patients of which nine with AIDS and Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (AIDS, TE), 11 with AIDS {{with or without}} other CNS AIDS-related opportunistic infections (non-TE AIDS) and eight control patients with or without inflammatory neurological disorders (control group). CSF restricted oligoclonal FLC bands either of k or λ isotype or both were found by AMI in 18 (90 %) out of 20 AIDS patients, while a CSF pattern predominantly characterized by FκLC rather than FλLC was observed in eight (88. 8 %) out of nine TE patients. No FLC components were detected in the matched sera of TE or non-TE AIDS patients or in the CSF and sera from control group. The anti-parasite-specific FκLC CSF/serum mean levels and the T. gondii-specific FκLC index values were found by ELISA to be significantly more elevated in TE patients when compared to non-TE AIDS or control group. These {{findings suggest that the}} increased production of T. gondii-specific FκLC could provide insights into pathogenesis of reactivated TE in immunocompromised patients and may have important diagnostic usefulness.

40|$|Amino acid-deprived rplK (previously {{known as}} relC) mutants of Escherichia coli cannot {{activate}} (p) ppGpp synthetase I (RelA) and consequently exhibit relaxed phenotypes. The rplK gene encodes ribosomal protein L 11, suggesting that L 11 {{is involved in}} regulating the activity of RelA. To investigate the role of L 11 in the stringent response, a derivative of rplK encoding L 11 lacking the N-terminal 36 amino acids (designated ′L 11) was constructed. Bacteria overexpressing ′L 11 exhibited a relaxed phenotype, and this was associated with an inhibition of RelA-dependent (p) ppGpp synthesis during amino acid deprivation. In contrast, bacteria overexpressing normal L 11 exhibited a typical stringent response. The overexpressed ′L 11 was incorporated into ribosomes and {{had no effect on}} the ribosome-binding activity of RelA. By several methods (yeast two-hybrid, <b>affinity</b> <b>blotting,</b> and copurification), no direct interaction was observed between the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of RelA and L 11. To determine whether the proline-rich helix of L 11 was involved in RelA regulation, the Pro- 22 residue was replaced with Leu by site-directed mutagenesis. The overexpression of the Leu- 22 mutant derivative of L 11 resulted in a relaxed phenotype. These results indicate that the proline-rich helix in the N terminus of L 11 is involved in regulating the activity of RelA...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to map the {{glycosylation}} pattern and antigenic properties of the salivary proteins of two closely related sand fly species, Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. orientalis. <b>Affinity</b> <b>blotting</b> with commercially available lectins revealed that many salivary proteins of these species are N-glycosylated, while the presence of O-glycosylation could not be confirmed. The level of N-glycosylation of most of these proteins is quite low, a larger number of potential N-glycosylation sites were found only in the amino acid sequences of P. orientalis hyaluronidase and endonucleases of both species tested. Four antigens from P. perniciosus salivary glands were selected for expression in a bacterial expression system; two of these proteins (PpeSP 01 and PpeSP 01 B) were not glycosylated and the glycosylation level of the remaining two (PpeSP 03 B and PpeSP 07) was low. The antigenic properties of the four chosen recombinant proteins were subsequently tested using immunoblot and ELISA. During the initial experiments with the sera of dogs experimentally bitten by P. perniciosus, two proteins (rSP 07 and rSP 01 B) were proven unsuitable and they were excluded from further experiments. Recombinant proteins rSP 03 B and rSP 01 were recognized by the same IgG antibodies as the native forms of these proteins [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Tonoplast vesicles were {{isolated}} by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation {{in the presence}} of Mg 2 + from 5 day old corn (Zea mays L., Golden Cross Bantam) seedling roots. Marker enzyme assays indicated only a low degree of cross-contamination of tonoplast vesicles at the 10 / 23 % (weight/weight) interface by other membrane components. Severalfold enrichment of tonoplast ATPase and pyrophosphatase was indicated in tonoplast fractions by dot blot studies with antibodies against an oat tonoplast ATPase and a mung bean tonoplast pyrophosphatase. Comparison of two-dimensional electrophoretic gels of tonoplast and microsomal membrane polypeptides revealed approximately 68 polypeptides to be specific to tonoplast by silver staining. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against a tonoplast holoenzyme ATPase from oat roots revealed the presence of the 72, 60, and 41 kilodalton polypeptides in isolated tonoplast vesicles from corn roots. <b>Affinity</b> <b>blotting</b> with concanavalin A and secondary antibodies indicated the degree of glycosylation of tonoplast polypeptides, where 21 of 68 tonoplast-specific polypeptides contained detectable carbohydrate moieties. Salt and NaOH washes removed 38 of the tonoplast-specific polypeptides, indicating a peripheral association with the membrane. Thirteen of the peripheral polypeptides and eight of the integral polypeptides were identified as glycoproteins. This information on the polypeptide composition of the tonoplast of root cells will aid in gaining insight into the role of this membrane in controlling vacuolar functions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} RbAp 48 {{protein is}} the most extensively studied member of the conserved family of Msi 1 -like WD- 40 repeat proteins, which are components of complexes involved in the assembly and modification of chromatin. We have isolated a plant homolog of RbAp 48, AtMSI 4. By metal <b>affinity</b> chromatography, zinc <b>blotting</b> and atomic absorption analysis, we demonstrate that purified recombinant RbAp 48 and AtMSI 4 proteins bind 3 – 4 metal ions per molecule of protein. Metal competition assays indicate a preference for zinc. Both N- and C-terminal halves of RbAp 48 and AtMSI 4 display zinc binding activity, suggesting it is an intrinsic property of the propeller structures likely to be formed by these proteins. Metal binding might mediate and/or regulate protein-protein interactions which are functionally important in chromatin metabolism...|$|R

Functional {{studies of the}} mutant proteins are necessary {{to better understand the}} pathogenesis of these diseases, however, no satisfactory system for the expression of mutant muscle actin proteins has been available. We investigated the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) for the abundant production of both normal and mutant skeletal muscle α-actin. We show that non-mutated actin produced in the BEVS behaves similarly to native actin, as shown by DNase I <b>affinity</b> purification, Western <b>blotting,</b> and consecutive cycles of polymerisation and depolymerisation. Additionally, we demonstrate the production of mutant actin proteins in the BEVS, without detriment to the insect cells in which they are expressed. The BEVS therefore is the method of choice for studying mutant actin proteins causing human diseases...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{pancreatic}} {{trypsin inhibitor}} (BPTI) binds to trypsin and anhydrotrypsin (an enzymatically inactive derivative of trypsin) with affinities of 6 x 10 (- 14) and 1. 1 x 10 (- 13) M, respectively. We {{have taken advantage}} of the high affinity and specificity of this binding reaction to develop a protein tagging system in which biotinylated trypsin or biotinylated anhydrotrypsin is used as the reagent to detect recombinant fusion proteins into which BPTI has been inserted. Two proteins, opsin and growth hormone, were used as targets for insertional mutagenesis with BPTI. In each case, both domains of the fusion protein appear to be correctly folded. The fusion proteins can be specifically and efficiently detected by biotinylated trypsin or biotinylated anhydrotrypsin, as demonstrated by staining of transfected cells, protein <b>blotting,</b> <b>affinity</b> purification, and a mobility shift assay in SDS/polyacrylamide gels...|$|R
