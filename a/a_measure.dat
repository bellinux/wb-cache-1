The balun has {{a wide range of}} operating frequency from 0. 9 to 3. 6 GHz. Within this operating band, the balun achieves <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> insertion loss of less than 1 dB, <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> return loss of better than 10 dB, <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> amplitude imbalance of less than 1 dB and <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> phase imbalance less than 7 °.

5|$|In 1969, the American Medical Association (AMA) {{approved}} <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as {{full and}} active {{members of the}} Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and residency programs. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it {{was an attempt to}} eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D. sponsored <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the ACGME, an independent board of the AMA.|$|E

5|$|Powell {{implemented}} {{the use of}} the state's sinking fund to pay interest on school bonds, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E
