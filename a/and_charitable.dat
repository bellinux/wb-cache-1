This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
