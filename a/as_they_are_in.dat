The status of each of these processes, and the sequence in which these processes are applied, <b>were</b> described <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> 1975, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> 1985, and what <b>they</b> might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the future...|$|R

5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles endocytosis, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E
5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the Flagellation of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have been painted last <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from the Passion of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly the same <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested {{as part of}} the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E
5|$|Just like {{individual}} competitions, {{there are}} two rounds, but with a difference. Each round is divided into four rotations or 'legs', in which a member of every team jumps once in the same order. Points are scored the same <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> individual competitions; however, an athlete's points for a jump are instead added to their team's total tally. The starting order of teams in the first round, and first three legs of the second round, is based on their standings in the Nations Cup. Teams are narrowed down to eight for the second round based on points scored, with the same four athletes jumping in their order of rotation as before.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep & 358/2 Days Original Soundtrack is a three-disc album {{containing}} {{music from}} the games Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, as well as Kingdom Hearts Re:coded, composed by Yoko Shimomura. It was released on February 2, 2011. Discs one and two contain music from Birth by Sleep, and disc three contains music from 358/2 Days (tracks 1 through 13), Re:coded (tracks 14 through 20), and Birth by Sleep: Final Mix (tracks 21 through 27). Tracks from 358/2 Days and Re:coded are in pure orchestrated form, and are not digitized <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the original game releases.|$|E

5|$|The game's story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} at —a bird-only high school {{located in the}} fictional Japanese town of —long after open warfare between humans and birds has ended. Society has adjusted to the avian conquest, though with minor bird-related cultural changes—for example, while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the present day, a major event in the game is Legumentine's Day, an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine's Day and Setsubun. In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles {{because they are not}} freely suspended in the body cavity <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E

5|$|The thorax of the {{butterfly}} {{is devoted to}} locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.|$|E
5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main cusps are about {{as high as the}} other parts of the crown, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result of wear in adults. The two cusps on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps, is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior cusps, the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the back margin of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{underwent}} {{an unprecedented}} mobilization of national {{resources for the}} Second World War. Conditions in the United States were not <b>as</b> strained <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom or <b>as</b> desperate <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military {{was unable to find}} any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.|$|R
