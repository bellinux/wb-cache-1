5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From {{time to time}} the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, {{it is worth noting}} that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

25|$|Among American-born {{citizens}} of Polish ancestry, roughly 50% report eating Polish dishes, and many can name {{a variety of}} Polish foods unprompted. Whereas over 60% of Italian Americans reported eating Italian food <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> less than 10% of Polish Americans ate Polish food once a week. This figure is still a higher occurrence than Irish Americans, who can only name a few traditional Irish foods (typically corned beef and cabbage), and only 30% report eating Irish food each year. Even fewer English, Dutch, and Scottish Americans can report that they eat ethnic cuisine regularly.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of the {{increasing}} player willingness to play video games {{across a variety of}} media and different platforms {{can be seen in the}} rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.|$|E
25|$|A {{representative}} {{survey of}} consumers {{carried out in}} December 2007 showed that most consumers believe prices are too high. However, it also showed that they overestimate the price of water (Euro 4.80/m3 instead of the actual average price of Euro 3.02/m3). Interestingly, 55% of the French population believe that treated wastewater is directly being reused as drinking water, {{which is not the}} case. The survey also shows that 84% of French consumers trust that the quality of their tap water is good. 67% declare that they drink water from the tap <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Those who are dissatisfied about tap water quality complain mainly about high levels of chlorine and calcium carbonate.|$|E

25|$|Only the {{insecticides}} spinosyn and abamectin {{are known}} to be effective against this pest. Neem based products are considered effective synergists. Product rotation is integral to resistance prevention programs. Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils are both effective, but only in very frequent, sometimes impractical spray schedules (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week).</b> Systemic neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid were once considered to be sparing of beneficial insects and natural predators, and recommended for integrated pest management of chilli thrips, especially when used as a soil soak or drip irrigation product. The past decade has revealed that neonicotinoids can seriously impact beneficial insects, especially bees, through effects that are not immediately apparent - even at trace concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{is fairly}} {{prevalent}} in the United States. About 75% of the United States reports praying <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized factor analysis to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka’s first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).|$|E
25|$|Curry {{is another}} popular {{imported}} dish and is ranked {{near the top}} of nearly all Japanese surveys for favorite foods. The average Japanese eats curry <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The origins of curry, as well many other foreign imports such as pan or bread are linked to the emergence of Yoshoku, or western cuisine. Yoshoku can be traced {{as far back as the}} late Muromachi period (1336-1573) during a culinary revolution called namban ryori (南蛮料理), which means “Southern barbarian cooking”, as it is rooted in European cuisine. This cuisine style was first seen in Nagasaki, which served as the point of contact between Europe and Japan at that point in time. Food items such as potatoes, corn, dairy products, as well as the hard candy kompeito (金平糖), spread during this time. This cuisine became popular in the Meiji period, which is considered by many historians to be when Japan first opened itself to the outside world. Today, many of these imported items still hold a heavy presence in Japan.|$|E
