5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family would retain {{the use of the}} land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John Blow and even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> such performances as authentic as possible as regards the original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who must decide whether or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, a criticism levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz Päetow, with the libretto becoming unstuck in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E

Leibniz wrote memoranda that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his calculus—off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by C.I. Gerhardt (1859). L. Couturat published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by Charles Sanders Peirce and by Gottlob Frege.|$|E

Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by his sets, and when he discovered that James was playing tapes of his own music he suggested that they make records.

25|$|For {{at least}} 26 years, Rameau was a {{professional}} organist {{in the service of}} religious institutions, and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent. Judging by the evidence, it was not his favourite field, but rather, simply <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> reasonable money. Rameau's few religious compositions are nevertheless remarkable and compare favourably to the works of specialists in the area. Only four motets have been attributed to Rameau with any certainty: Deus noster refugium, In convertendo, Quam dilecta, and Laboravi.|$|E
25|$|As a 13-year-old {{high school}} student, Bowers's {{interests}} included reptiles, scouting, short-wave radio, Strombecker kit models of World War II airplanes, and rocks and minerals. During this time Bowers {{became interested in}} the written word. He received Raymond L. Ditmars' Reptiles of North America from his mother as a Christmas gift in 1952. According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> just about anything sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the written word and how it can spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton.

They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E

He also attended Mass daily, and would sometimes use a patient's faith, as well as the sacraments, in his treatments. Moscati also refused to charge the poor for their treatment, and was known to sometimes send a patient home with a prescription and a 50-lira note in an envelope.|$|E
25|$|List of Illinois High School Association member {{conferences}} Note that, {{unlike some}} other {{states such as}} Iowa or Texas, Illinois' high school athletic conferences are not officially organized by the IHSA and have little bearing on playoff competition. Individual schools organize themselves into conferences, mostly as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> scheduling easier, and many schools choose to compete as independents. However, conference affiliation does come into play in football competition, as conference champions earn an automatic bid into the playoffs (football conferences must have at least six members for a champion to be automatically playoff-eligible). Football teams not affiliated in a conference can still qualify with six or more wins. Football competition is played with a nine-game schedule.|$|E
25|$|Forced labour {{can also}} be imposed by governments who “conscript their own {{subjects}} and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”. When imposed by governments, forced labour does not include military conscription or penal labour. Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can {{be a form of}} involuntary servitude in the private sector – sweatshops. Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, perhaps in a workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their place of employment they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.|$|E

25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be done properly by an experienced teacher who spends many years passing on the teachings to the student in person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> sure the secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of Prompto's {{character}} is his humble origins {{when compared to}} Gladiolus and Ignis, expressing this in his words and actions. Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, {{so that he would}} have international appeal. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E
25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator {{tells the}} reader {{that he was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> sure the crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E

25|$|Beerus awakens from a 39-year {{sleep and}} goes {{in search of}} a Super Saiyan God. He travels to meet Goku after {{learning}} that he had defeated Freeza, and easily defeated him despite his advanced stages of the Super Saiyan transformation. Beerus next travels to Earth, coming across partygoers of Bulma's birthday party, including Vegeta, who met Beerus during his youth and is fearful of him due to his superior strength. Although Beerus is disappointed that Vegeta does not know what a Super Saiyan God is, he stays at Bulma's party because he enjoys Earth's cuisine. Beerus is mostly calm until requesting some pudding from Majin Boo, who refuses to share, causing him to become enraged and easily beat Boo, Gotenks, Gohan, Android 18, Piccolo, and Tenshinhan in combat. Bulma slaps Beerus, who he slaps back and in doing so causes an angered Vegeta to grow in strength and seemingly surpass him. Beerus then easily defeats Vegeta after powering up, and moves to destroy the Earth until Goku pleads for him to allow the Earthlings time to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> a Super Saiyan God appear. After the Saiyans perform a ritual, which sees Goku transform into a Super Saiyan God, Beerus duels him and though defeating him, spares him and the Earth. During Freeza's resurrection and subsequent battle with the heroes, Beerus observes the fight and worries Freeza that he will become involved until Beerus confirms he will not.|$|E
