5|$|After {{a heated}} week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting {{something}} special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And the fighters delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion. From early {{on it was}} clear that the bad blood would not <b>adversely</b> impact the fight, as both men fought strong technical fights.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2003 final, Canavan relinquished the {{captaincy}} to Cormac McAnallen, but the 24-year-old died {{shortly after}} {{taking up the}} position. This tragedy <b>adversely</b> affected the mindset of the team, and {{they were unable to}} defend their All-Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Ickenham's residents' {{association}} {{was established in}} 1924, and it plays an active role within the community; {{in recent years the}} association has been involved in preventing developments by Tesco and IKEA, which in the association's view would have <b>adversely</b> affected the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Tittle {{suffered}} from severe dementia which <b>adversely</b> affected his memory and limited his conversation {{to a handful}} of topics. Tittle died on October 8, 2017, at a hospital in Stanford, California, sixteen days before his 91st birthday; of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{construction}} can <b>adversely</b> affect land stability. Subsidence {{has occurred}} in the Wairakei field in New Zealand. In Staufen im Breisgau, Germany, tectonic uplift occurred instead, due to a previously isolated anhydrite layer coming in contact with water and turning into gypsum, doubling its volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} wild animals to {{navigate}} may be <b>adversely</b> affected by products of human activity. For example, {{there is evidence}} that pesticides may interfere with bee navigation, and that lights may harm turtle navigation.|$|E
5|$|Tourism and {{deforestation}} in {{the surroundings}} {{have taken a}} heavy toll on the lake, <b>adversely</b> affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl {{and habitat}} {{destruction}} have <b>adversely</b> affected Gila monster numbers. In 1952, {{they became the}} first venomous animal to be given legal protection. Gila monsters are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. In 1963, the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo to successfully breed Gila monsters in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Zinc in rivers {{flowing through}} {{industrial}} and mining areas {{can be as}} high as 20ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2ppm <b>adversely</b> affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the National Guard offered {{shelters for}} at least 400homeless {{residents}} in Stuart. Of the 7,900families <b>adversely</b> affected by the hurricane, 4,325required assistance from the American Red Cross. Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs <b>adversely</b> affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} <b>adversely</b> affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has seen}} a {{significant}} growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001. The colonial town was designed for a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems. The district's forests and other natural wealth have been <b>adversely</b> affected by an ever-growing population.|$|E
5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not <b>adversely</b> impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they <b>adversely</b> affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkstr√∂m. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be <b>adversely</b> affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} <b>adversely</b> {{affected}} by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects {{of human activity}} such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{standards}} of justice within prisons involving the giving {{of reasons to}} a prisoner for any decision which materially and <b>adversely</b> affects him; a grievance procedure and disciplinary proceedings which ensure that the Governor deals with most matters under his present powers; relieving Boards of Visitors of their adjudicatory role; and providing for final access to an independent Complaints Adjudicator.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Jackson {{served as}} audio {{director}} at the 15th Asian Games, held in Doha, Qatar. The main loudspeakers for the opening and closing ceremonies were the KUDO model from L-ACOUSTICS. Jackson found that extreme heat and occasional downpours did not <b>adversely</b> affect the Optocore fibre audio connections around the largest venues. Digital audio was passed {{to a combination of}} Lake Contour and Dolby Lake Processors.|$|E
5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by a bee {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole.

5|$|It is also {{reported}} that the soil of the park formed by the phumdis is highly acidic, with unsuitable pH conditions for many species of plants to grow and flourish. Further, the acidity of the soil has also <b>adversely</b> affected the fish breeding farms.s|accessdate=2009-04-04|author =Shaji K.A.|publisher= Udhakamandalam, Countercurrents.org}} Recent reports indicate that locals are slicing the phumdis into sizeable pieces and towing them with canoes to sell to fish culture owners.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Marshall came {{to believe}} that Eichelberger's talents were wasted at West Point, but he was opposed by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at West Point. When Marshall told Watson that Eichelberger's chances for {{promotion}} to major general were being <b>adversely</b> affected by being denied the chance to command a division, Watson added Eichelberger's name {{to the top of a}} promotion list and had the President sign it. In this manner, Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts <b>adversely</b> on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could <b>adversely</b> affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react <b>adversely</b> to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related gastrointestinal disorders, rumination can <b>adversely</b> affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not <b>adversely</b> affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
5|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} <b>adversely</b> {{affected}} killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered {{part of a larger}} population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.|$|E
5|$|The UBS's Basel III {{capital ratio}} {{concerned}} {{benefited from the}} appreciation of the Swiss franc. At the same time, since the portion of UBS's operating income denominated in foreign currencies {{is greater than the}} portion of operating expenses so denominated, the UBS was also <b>adversely</b> affected, with further implications emanating from changes in interest rates as applied to equity and capital.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} at a neutral venue, Prater Stadium in Vienna. The match took place in torrential rain, <b>adversely</b> {{affecting}} the attendance. The official figure was 7,968, though sources vary, {{with a number of}} figures between 7,968 and 15,000 reported. Of those, approximately 5,000 were Manchester City supporters. Due to Eastern bloc travel restrictions, only 300 supporters, relatives and officials were permitted to travel from Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} supercars was growing when the {{production}} XJ220 was announced, with comparable cars immediately reselling after delivery {{for three and}} four times the list price. The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than ¬£800,000 in 1990, but like the XJ220 it was <b>adversely</b> affected by the recession, and by 1992 prices had dropped to between ¬£100,000 to ¬£150,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of pain depends {{mainly on the}} location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant cancer are experiencing pain, and two thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it <b>adversely</b> affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities of daily living.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would <b>adversely</b> affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, <b>adversely</b> affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not <b>adversely</b> affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Train {{operating}} {{companies were}} <b>adversely</b> {{affected by the}} disruption, losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash. Freight operator EWS was cancelling up to 400 trains per week as a result, whilst estimates put Freightliner's resultant losses at ¬£1 million per month. The cost to the entire UK economy of the disruption was estimated at ¬£6 million per day.|$|E
