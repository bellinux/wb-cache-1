40|$|Infrared (IR) {{spectroscopy}} is used {{to analyze}} urinary calculus (renal stone) constituents. However, interpretation of IR spectra for quantifying urinary calculus constituents in mixtures is difficult, requiring expert knowledge by trained technicians. In our laboratory IR spectra of unknown calculi are compared with reference spectra in a computerized library search of 235 reference spectra from various mixtures of constituents in different proportions, followed by visual interpretation of band intensities for more precise semiquantitative determination of the composition. To minimize the need for this last step, we tested artificial neural network models for detecting the most frequently occurring compositions of urinary catculi. Using constrained mixture designs, we prepared various samples containing <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> urate, brushite, <b>carbonate</b> apatite, cystine, struvite, uric acid, weddellite, and whewellite {{for use as a}} training set. We assayed known artificial mixtures as well as selected patients' samples from which the semiquantitative compositions were determined by computerized library search followed by visual interpretation. Neural network analysis was more accurate than the library search and required less expert knowledge because careful visual inspection of the band intensities could be omitted. We conclude that neural networks are promising tools for routine quantification of urinary calculus compositions and for other related types of analyses in the clinical laboratory...|$|R

40|$|Coloring hair using a level 3 {{permanent}} colorant involves two processes, lightening {{the underlying}} mela-nin and {{formation of the}} colored chromophores inside the hair. In typical in-market products the oxidant used to achieve these changes is hydrogen peroxide buffered at pH 10 with an alkalizer such as ammonium hydroxide. A new oxidant has been developed based on the combination of <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide and glycine at pH 9 that can match the lightening and color performance of the current oxidant. It has the advantage that both the <b>carbonate</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide concentrations can be changed to alter the lighten-ing performance making it a more fl exible oxidant. This allows the capability to lighten the hair in a shorter time, or with lower hydrogen peroxide levels. This paper discusses the key oxidizing species that are present in both systems and the mechanisms of mela-nin lightening. In addition, the lightening performance will be assessed {{as a function of}} time, pH, hydrogen peroxide concentration and carbonate concentration. The importance of glycine to the oxidant is also described along with a proposal for its mechanism of action. It has been demonstrated that the addition of glycine can control the undesired formation of carbonate radi-cals that can be generated from the oxidant. The control of these radicals enables the oxidant to deliver excel-lent lightening with no negatives in fi ber damage vs. conventional oxidants...|$|R
