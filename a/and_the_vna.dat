50|$|The Battle of Saigon was a month-long {{battle between}} the Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam (later to become the Army of the Republic of Vietnam) and the private army of the Bình Xuyên {{organised}} crime syndicate. At the time, the Bình Xuyên was licensed with controlling the national police by Emperor Bảo Đại, and Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm issued an ultimatum for them to surrender and come under state control. The battle started on April 27, 1955, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> had largely crushed the Bình Xuyên within a week. Fighting was mostly concentrated {{in the inner city}} Chinese business district of Cholon. The densely crowded area saw some 500-1000 deaths and up to 20,000 civilians made homeless in the cross-fire. In the end, the Bình Xuyên were decisively defeated, their army disbanded and their vice operations collapsed.|$|E
50|$|Đức was {{a member}} of the Vietnamese National Army of the French-backed State of Vietnam, which fought against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was run by the {{communist}} Viet Minh of Hồ Chí Minh. In 1955, during the transition period after the partition of Vietnam, Đức was a VNA colonel and fought in operations against the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt, who was trying to wrest power from Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm. After Ba Cụt was driven from the Mekong Delta, he fled to the Thất Sơn mountains near the border with Cambodia. There, Đức commanded an operation that attempt to capture Ba Cụt in 1955. He claimed to the media that he would capture Ba Cụt within ten days he was unable to do so. Ba Cụt was finally captured in April 1956 and executed several months later. By the end of that year, Diệm had proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.|$|E

Diệm complained to a French general, alleging that Ba Cụt's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to <b>the</b> <b>VNA.</b> <b>The</b> Hòa Hảo accused Diệm of treachery in his negotiations with various groups. They charged the prime minister with integrating Thế's forces into <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> in return for them being allowed to attack Ba Cụt {{with the aid of}} <b>the</b> <b>VNA,</b> <b>and</b> that this part of the deal had been kept secret. They warned that other Hòa Hảo leaders who had stopped fighting could join Ba Cụt, and appealed to Diệm's U.S. sponsors.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the rabies neutralizing antibody (VNA) response after immunization against rabies is an acceptable index of the efficacy of a vaccine and a successful treatment. Several tests have been developed in attempt to improve the assessment of VNA, from mice inoculation to cell-culture fluorescence inhibition tests. All of them, however, present special difficulties in terms of reading or accuracy. The present study describes a neutralization test performed in cell-culture appraised by flow cytometry (FC). Serial dilutions of the serum samples were mixed in vitro with rabies virus before the addition of BHK- 21 cells. After 24 h-incubation, cells were released by trypsin treatment, fixed and permeabilized with a p-formaldehyde solution and stained with a rabies virus nucleocapsid protein-specific antibody conjugate. The percentage of virus infection inhibition caused by specific antibodies present in the serum were evaluated in a Beckton & Dickinson FACSCalibur® flow cytometer. A correlation curve between the IU/ml content {{and the percentage of}} infective inhibition was built with a reference serum <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> titers of serum samples were obtained by extrapolation. Titers obtained by FC and standard test showed an effective pairing results (p < 0. 01), with a correlation coefficient (r) = 0. 7. These results permit to envisage the FC as a suitable technique to evaluate VNA in sera from immunized animals and likely in human serum samples. Nevertheless, new studies comparing FC to gold-standard techniques are required for determining the FC values of Sensibility and Specificity...|$|E

5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of <b>the</b> National Police <b>and</b> submit to his command by integrating into <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining <b>the</b> <b>VNA,</b> gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> initiated <b>the</b> Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed.

Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a novel {{measurement}} setup and thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration kit for vector network analyser (VNA) measurements at 220 GHz to 325 GHz (WR- 03) is presented. Measurements on passive membrane circuit devices under test (DUTs) show {{improvement in the}} S-parameters compared to a waveguide integrated membrane circuit setup in previous work, especially in reducing <b>the</b> ripples <b>and</b> increasing repeatability of <b>the</b> measurements. <b>VNA</b> measurements provide a challenge when measuring on waveguide integrated membrane circuit devices at terahertz frequencies. In this setup, phase uncertainty in the measurements, due to waveguide width tolerance, is reduced by shortening the access waveguides. Because both waveguide inputs are placed in the same flange, the access waveguides can be made much shorter. However, {{in order to accommodate}} different DUT and TRL line lengths, two bends were introduced in each waveguide, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trade-off between sharper bends or longer access waveguides effect on uncertainty, investigated. By the use of an adapter block, which puts <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> extender outputs in the same flange, phase uncertainty due to cable flex is eliminated by locking <b>the</b> <b>VNA</b> frequency extenders in position during the entire measurement...|$|R
