30|$|The {{data sets}} for each pattern and each {{combination}} of DER are pre-generated, shuffled and split into 80 % used {{for training and}} validation and 20 % used for the model evaluation presented in the results section. For the training of the ANNs, these 80 % are split again into training and validation sets using a ratio of 90 / 10. In all cases, we use the Adam optimizer with the default parameters recommended in (Kingma and Ba 2014). The best model of each ANN is selected based on the lowest loss value for the validation data after each epoch. This model is evaluated using the 20 % test data <b>which</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unused</b> for model training/validation. We train all networks with a batch size of 1024 and up to 5000 epochs. The training is stopped whenever the validation loss does not improve in the last 100 epochs (early stopping with 100 epochs patience). Regularization of weights or application of dropout is usually applied to achieve better generalization (Goodfellow et al. 2016). We only use dropout in our classification networks.|$|R
40|$|Distributed Computing {{frameworks}} {{belong to}} a class of programming models that allow developers to launch workloads on large clusters of machines. Due to the {{dramatic increase in the}} volume of data gathered by ubiquitous computing devices, data analytic workloads have become a common case among distributed computing applications, making Data Science an entire field of Computer Science. We argue that Data Scientist's concern lays in three main components: a dataset, a sequence of operations they wish to apply on this dataset, and some constraint they may have related to their work (performances, QoS, budget, etc). However, it is actually extremely difficult, without domain expertise, to perform data science. One need to select the right amount and type of resources, pick up a framework, and configure it. Also, users are often running their application in shared environments, ruled by schedulers expecting them to specify precisely their resource needs. Inherent to the distributed and concurrent nature of the cited frameworks, monitoring and profiling are hard, high dimensional problems that block users from making the right configuration choices and determining the right amount of resources they need. Paradoxically, the system is gathering a large amount of monitoring data at runtime, <b>which</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unused.</b> In the ideal abstraction we envision for data scientists, the system is adaptive, able to exploit monitoring data to learn about workloads, and process user requests into a tailored execution context. In this work, we study different techniques that have been used to make steps toward such system awareness, and explore a new way to do so by implementing machine learning techniques to recommend a specific subset of system configurations for Apache Spark applications. Furthermore, we present an in depth study of Apache Spark executors configuration, which highlight the complexity in choosing the best one for a given workload. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Many {{managers}} undertake 'research' in {{the course}} of their normal work [...] for planning, problem solving, market research and decision-support [...] in which they have to gather information which enables decisions to be taken about a course of action. However, from our experience the methods they employ are dominated by quantitative techniques, augmented by an interview or questionnaire survey from <b>which</b> qualitative data <b>remains</b> <b>unused.</b> Yet many of the issues managers investigate are complex, messy, and involve a range of stakeholders with different concerns and perceptions. These are circumstances in which qualitative research could offer a richness and depth of understanding unlikely to be achieved with quantitative approaches. This paper describes three cases in which the authors supported practising managers in their wish to identify and use qualitative approaches in their 'research'. We describe the processes which took place and the managers' experience of using the qualitative approaches. We then reflect on the potential and the problems for the wider use of qualitative research, methods by managers...|$|R
