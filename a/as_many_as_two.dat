5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law – a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.|$|E

One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets. British and U.S. civilian authorities ordered their military forces in Europe to deport to the Soviet Union up to two million former residents of the Soviet Union, including persons who had left the Russian Empire and established different citizenship years before.

25|$|The Hiberno-Norse from Dublin and the Isle of Man {{routinely}} {{raided the}} coasts of Wales, with the Welsh people of Ynys Môn and the Llŷn Peninsula suffering the most in Gwynedd. In 987 a Norse raiding party landed on Môn and captured <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> thousand of the island's residents, selling them as slaves across northern Europe. Historian and author Dr. John Davies argues that it is during this period that the Norse name for Môn, Anglesey, came into existence; it was later adopted into English. In 989 Meredudd ab Owain bribed the Norse not to raid that year.

25|$|One {{substantial}} strategic {{element to}} baseball {{is to use}} this phenomenon as much as possible. Defenses try to force a match between pitcher and hitter by side, and offences attempt to mismatch them; both teams use substitutions at times to accomplish the desired outcome. One response to this phenomenon is that many hitters, among them {{a number of the}} finest and most powerful to play the game, such as Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, became adept as youngsters to hitting both left-handed and right-handed to prevent defences from using that advantage against them. Many professional clubs employ <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> or three switch hitters so as to neutralise the advantage of side selection. However, only one switch pitcher has played in the major leagues in modern times.|$|E

The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One {{of the biggest problems}} encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|As {{the result}} of a 1991 {{referendum}} in Houston, the two-year term was amended to elected officials who can serve up to three terms until 2015 where the three term limit and two year terms were replaced with a two four-year terms - a mayor is elected for a four-year term (previously the mayor, controller, and councilmembers are elected to a two-year term prior to the November 3, 2015 city elections), and can be elected to <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> consecutive terms. City council members, who also have a three-term limit, are elected from eleven districts in the city, along with five at-large council members, who represent the entire city.

In all 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled and it has been asserted that <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> million might have perished in the process. Due to horrifying revelations of Nazi genocidal practices at the same period, and to the collaboration of many ethnic Germans with Nazi occupation in various countries, their expulsion was mostly tolerated by international public opinion at the time. Historians such as Thomas Kamusella, Piotr Pikle, Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees all describe it as ethnic cleansing.

The single articulated locomotive could move <b>as</b> <b>many</b> cars <b>as</b> <b>two</b> Shay locomotives from Rainbow to Atchee, and made the trip in half the time.
