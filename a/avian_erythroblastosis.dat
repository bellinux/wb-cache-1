40|$|Three new erbB transducing viruses {{generated}} during <b>avian</b> leukosis virus-induced <b>erythroblastosis</b> {{have been}} cloned and sequenced, and their transforming abilities have been analyzed. Provirus 9134 E 1 expresses an amino-terminally truncated erbB {{product that is}} analogous to the proviral insertionally activated c-erbB gag-erbB fusion product. This virus efficiently induces erythroblastosis, but does not transform fibroblasts in vitro or induce sarcomas in vivo. In contrast, virus 9134 S 3 expresses an erbB product identical to the erbB product of 9134 E 1, {{with the exception of a}} large internal deletion located between the kinase domain and the putative autophosphorylation site, P 1. Interestingly, this virus is no longer capable of inducing erythroblastosis, but can induce both fibrosarcomas and hemangiomas in vivo. Provirus 9134 F 3 has sustained an approximately 23 -amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation and is capable of inducing both erythroblastosis and sarcomagenesis. This virus expresses an erbB product with the shortest carboxy-terminal truncation sufficient to reveal the sarcomagenic potential of this protein. The distinct transforming properties of these viruses indicate that different structural domains of the erbB product confer distinct disease specificities...|$|R

Mitogenic hormones like {{epidermal growth factor}} and insulin-like growth factors cause these cells to proliferate very actively, as does infection with <b>avian</b> sarcoma viruses, <b>erythroblastosis</b> virus, or myelocytomatosis virus. We {{have found that the}} combination of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), ionomycin or ouabain, and raised extracellular magnesium, likewise, causes these cells to proliferate very actively. Although these agents have no significant effect when acting singly, the combination of PMA at 100 ng/ml and 0. 5 microM ionomycin induces a 6 -fold increase in cell number at 4 days, and the combination of PMA, ionomycin, and 5. 6 mM magnesium induces 12 -fold multiplication. Likewise, PMA plus 1 microM ouabain induces 3 -fold multiplication, whereas the combination of PMA, ouabain, and magnesium induces 6 -fold multiplication. The tumor promoter PMA, like diacylglycerol released by breakdown of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol diphosphate, is known to activate the serine- and threonine-specific intracellular enzyme kinase C. The divalent cation ionophore ionomycin is known to carry calcium into cells down an electrochemical gradient, and the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain appears to elevate intracellular calcium by means of a sodium-mediated exchange mechanism. Magnesium, like calcium, is known to enter cells passively down an electrochemical gradient and {{to be involved in the}} regulation of many key intracellular reactions. Our findings with PMA, ionotropes, and magnesium support a hypothesis that diacylglycerol-mediated activation of kinase C plus cellular divalent cation influx and/or mobilization, caused by the action of mitogenic hormones or the protein products of onc genes, are key events in the initiation of cell replication...|$|R

A restriction fragment containing the v-erbB sequences from a molecular clone of <b>avian</b> <b>erythroblastosis</b> virus was inserted into a Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} vector. The construct, designated MuLV/erbB, transformed NIH 3 T 3 cells at a high efficiency in the DNA transfection assay. Individual MuLV/erbB transfectants grew in soft agar and were tumorigenic. The transfectants contained v-erbB DNA sequences, expressed v-erbB-specific transcripts, and synthesized v-erbB-related glycoproteins. The majority of transfectants produced two major v-erbB gene products of 58 and 66 kilodaltons. However, some transfectants produced much smaller v-erbB-specific proteins. Tunicamycin experiments revealed that the size heterogeneity observed between different transfectants was not due to variations in glycoprotein processing, implying that, in some cases, alterations in the MuLV/erbB genome occurred during the transfection process. These findings indicate that expression of the complete v-erbB gene product is not required for transformation of NIH 3 T 3 cells. A transmissible murine v-erbB (M-erbB) virus was generated by infection of nonproducer transfectants with amphotrophic murine leukemia virus. Transmission of the rescued M-erbB virus was confirmed by DNA, RNA, and protein analyses.

Using the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene cloned into the vector as a test construct, expression of enzyme activity could be detected in 90 to 95 % of transfected target cells and in 80 to 85 % of subsequently infected cells. In addition, a cDNA encoding the avian erythrocyte band 3 anion exchange protein has been expressed from the vector in both chicken embryo fibroblasts and QT 6 cells and appears to function as an active, plasma membrane-based anion transporter.

40|$|The avian {{carcinoma}} virus MC 29 (MC 29 V) {{contains a}} sequence of approximately 1, 500 nucleotides which may represent a gene responsible for tumorigenesis by MC 29 V. We present evidence that MC 29 V has acquired this nucleotide sequence from the DNA of its host. The host sequence which has been incorporated by MC 29 V is transcribed into RNA in uninfected chicken cells and thus probably encodes a cellular gene. We have prepared radioactive DNA complementary to the putative MC 29 V transforming gene (cDNAmc 29) and have found that sequences homologous to cDNAmc 29 {{are present in the}} genomes of several uninfected vertebrate species. The DNA of chicken, the natural host for MC 29 V, contains at least 90 % of the sequences represented by cDNAmc 29. DNAs from other animals show significant but decreasing amounts of complementarity to cDNAmc 29 in accordance with their evolutionary divergence from chickens; the thermal stabilities of duplexes formed between cDNAmc 29 and avian DNAs also reflect phylogenetic divergence. Sequences complementary to cDNAmc 29 are transcribed into approximately 10 copies per cell of polyadenylated RNA in uninfected chicken fibroblasts. Thus, the vertebrate homolog of cDNAmc 29 may be a gene which has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and which served as a progenitor for the putative transforming gene of MC 29 V. Recent experiments suggest that the putative transforming gene of <b>avian</b> <b>erythroblastosis</b> virus, like that of MC 29 V, may have arisen by incorporation of a host gene (Stehelin et al., personal communication). These findings for <b>avian</b> <b>erythroblastosis</b> virus and MC 29 V closely parallel previous results, suggesting a host origin for src (D. H. Spector, B. Baker, H. E. Varmus, and J. M.

We also show that AEV-transformed erythroleukemia cells were resistant to TGF-β–induced growth inhibition and that TGF-β sensitivity could be recovered by reducing v-ErbA expression.

Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled (30 min) EGF receptor protein revealed that synthesis of new EGF receptor follows the increase in receptor RNA.
