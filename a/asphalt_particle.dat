40|$|Asphalt joints are {{potentially}} weakest parts of every pavement. Despite of their importance, reliable tools for measuring their mechanical properties for design and performance assessments are still scarce. This {{is particularly true}} for cold joints when attaching a new hot pavement to a cold existing one as in case of large patches for pavement repair. In this study, three static fracture testing methods, i. e. indirect tensile test (IDT), direct tension test (DTT) and 4 point bending (4 PB), were adapted and used for evaluating different laboratory made joints. The results suggested that joints with inclined interfaces and also the ones with combined interface treatments (preheated and sealed) seemed to show more promising behaviors than the vertical and untreated joints. It was also confirmed that compacting from the hot side towards the joint improved the joint properties due to imposing a different flow pattern {{as compared to the}} frequent compaction methods. The latter finding highlighted the importance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particle</b> rearrangements and flow during the compaction phase as a very little known subject in asphalt industry. Studies on compaction are of special practical importance since they may also contribute to reducing the possibility of over-compaction and aggregate crushing. Therefore, in this study, a new test method, i. e. Flow Test (FT), was developed to simulate the material flow during compaction. Initially, asphalt materials were substituted by geometrically simple model materials to lower the level of complexity for checking the feasibility of the test method as well as modeling purposes. X-ray radiography images were also used for capturing the flow patterns during the test. Results of the FT on model materials showed the capability of the test method to clearly distinguish between specimens with different characteristics. In addition, a simple discrete element model was applied for {{a better understanding of the}} test results as a basis for further improvements when studying real mixtures. Then, real mixtures were prepared and tested under the same FT configuration and the results were found to support the findings from the feasibility tests. The test method also showed its potential for capturing flow pattern differences among different mixtures even without using the X-ray. Therefore, the FT was improved as an attempt towards developing a systematic workability test method focusing on the flow of particles at early stages of compaction and was called the Compaction Flow Test (CFT). The CFT was used for testing mixtures with different characteristics to identify the parameters with highest impact on the <b>asphalt</b> <b>particle</b> movements under compaction forces. X-ray investigations during the CFT underlined the reliability of the CFT results. In addition, simple discrete element models were successfully generated to justify some of the CFT results.

40|$|Modified {{sulfonated}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> have {{a bright}} application {{prospect of the}} profile control of thick reservoirs due to the low cost, extensive sources, and good compatibility with reservoir. Nevertheless, the matching relationship between <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> and reservoir pore has seldom been investigated till now. Oversized particles always block the near-wellbore area, which causes high injection pressures, while undersized particles cannot plug large pores. We designed a core for this experiment which has a high permeability zone {{in front of it}} and many pressure measuring points. We could quantitatively assess the matching relationship by measuring the on-way resistance coefficient, residual resistance factor, and relative change of permeability of man-made cores after injecting asphalt. Experimental results indicate that <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> with sizes of 0. 02 [*]mm, 0. 02 – 0. 06 [*]mm, and 0. 08 – 0. 1 [*]mm match with reservoir permeability of 500 [*]mD, 1000 [*]mD, and 2000 [*]mD, respectively. Undersized or oversized particles can reduce the conformance control effect, and the concentration of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> in the injectant can limit their migration ability. When the concentration of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> increases to 3000 [*]mg/L, accumulations of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> can be caused in the formation, in which a scheme with <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> alternative water injection is proposed to avoid the accumulation...|$|R

In this work, the <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> were first slurried with water and then gasified to produce synthesis gas. The gasification process of asphalt water slurry in an entrained flow gasifier was simulated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The trajectories and residence time of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles,</b> and the reaction rates, gas species distribution, temperature field and carbon conversion in the entrained flow gasifier were obtained.

Moreover, the effects of particle size, oxygen equivalence ratio, and mass content of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> on the gasification performance of asphalt water slurry were investigated. These results are helpful for industrial application of asphalt water slurry gasification technology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{electrical}} analysis of emulsified asphalt and aggregate explains the reaction {{mechanism of the}} emulsified asphalt and aggregate. When emulsified asphalt and wet mineral aggregate contact each other, <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> with a charge have chemical adsorption with aggregate at the surface of mineral aggregate, and <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> are arranged {{on the surface of}} later quickly. Subsequently, asphalt of recycled mixture can be more cohesive after a series of process between emulsion and aggregate, such as demulsification and drying by distillation. A compact structure is formed by asphalt wrapping aggregate to make recycled mixture high strength. The mole- coulomb theory analyzes formation principle of emulsified asphalt cold recycled mixture strength. The strength of the recycled mixture mainly depends on the cohesion and internal friction among materials. In early stages, asphalt can not bonding because of water, which reduce the friction resistance of recycled mixture, and lead to the early strength of recycled mixture is small. After curing, the recycled mixture has the similar structure like hot asphalt mixture, which the cohesion and frictional resistance of recycled mixture became strong and the strength increased greatly. Besides, this paper expounds the dual role of cement that hydration reaction and of being active mineral powder in the process of emulsified asphalt cold recycled mixture strength formation...|$|R

40|$|In {{northern}} latitudes mineral dust {{is formed}} when cars use studded tyres and roads are sanded to obtain more traction on the icy surfaces. Anti-skid and asphalt aggregates with different textural, mineralogical and mechanical properties were tested with an indoor road simulator fitted with studded and friction tyres. The {{particle size distribution}} and proportions of dust from pavement and anti-skid aggregate were analyzed using SEM-EDX. The wear on the road pavement depends on {{the properties of the}} anti-skid and <b>asphalt</b> aggregate (<b>particle</b> size distribution, mechanical/physical and textural properties). Antiskid aggregates, which contain mainly hard minerals (e. g. feldspars and quartz) and which have a low resistance to fragmentation, should be used with caution as they may break more easily into smaller particles and are likely to wear the pavement. By using high-quality anti-skid aggregates it is possible {{to reduce the amount of}} urban dust...|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} is proposed for the computational generation of realistic asphalt mixture porosity for computational simulations. The algorithm starts by generating in a 2 D domain a number of randomly positioned circular or elliptical elements that are meant to represent virtual <b>asphalt</b> aggregate <b>particles.</b> These elements are then grown by mimicking the biological mechanism called contact inhibition until a target air void content (AVC), chosen by the user, is met. In addition, multiple 2 D domains {{can be converted to}} 3 D and combined to generate a multi-layered realistic representation of the porosity present in asphalt mixtures. In this paper, the working mechanism of the {{algorithm is}} described and its efficiency is assessed. Moreover, the validity of the results is discussed, and virtual domains, in both 2 and 3 dimensions, are compared with real CT scans in order to show the efficacy of this approach. It was found that the virtual representations of the asphalt mixture porosity show realistic characteristics in terms of air void content and that the air void size distribution is consistent with that of real specimens...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the influence of}} temperature, water, and granulometry in the cohesion of asphalt mixtures. The study {{was carried out by}} subjecting dry and wet samples to the UCL test. The research started by characterizing the granular material and three asphalts with different behaviour (60 / 70, 85 / 100 and modified with polymer SBS). The grain size curves used correspond to the so established as md 10 and md 12 by the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano (IDU). The asphalt optimal percentage was determined via the Marshall apparatus in samples without filler, following UCL test procedures. Several samples were built with the optimal percentage and tested by means of an Angeles Machine at different typical Colombian temperatures in dry and wet state. The results obtained show that the modified asphalt presents a higher cohesion rate than conventional asphalts; that water diminishes the cohesion between the <b>asphalt</b> and the <b>particles</b> irrespective of the granule used, and that the md 12 granulometry yield higher losses than the md 10 grain size...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt {{compaction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important phases of road construction, being the decisive phase when the structure of the asphalt pavement layer is formed. In spite of its importance, the knowledge about this construction phase is still based on empirical and technological background and therefore surprisingly limited. This lack of knowledge is also due to the fact that the existing laboratory scale compaction devices for mix design are not fully capable of simulating the field compaction. The simulation of asphalt compaction in the laboratory is normally focused on the vertical rearrangements of <b>asphalt</b> <b>particles</b> whereas the flow behavior of these particles in other directions is mostly neglected. However, existing literature suggests that the neglected flow {{is one of the}} most important factors for the quality of the road construction, particularly in special cases such as asphalt joints. Therefore, building up a better understanding of the flow behavior of asphalt mixtures subjected to compaction loads is needed for improving the quality of the pavements. In this study, a new test setup, the so called Compaction Flow Test (CFT), was developed to simulate the flow behavior of asphalt mixtures at early stages of compaction. In the first step, feasibility tests were performed, substituting asphalt mixtures by model materials with simple geometries and less complex properties. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) was utilized for capturing 2 D radiography images of the flow patterns in the model material during the test. Results of the CFT showed the capability of the new test setup to clearly distinguish between model mixtures with different characteristics. Hence, in the next step, the CFT was applied to real asphalt mixtures and the obtained results were found to support the findings of the feasibility tests with the model materials. The results from the feasibility tests encouraged examining the possible use of an ultrasonic sensor as alternative to the complex and costly X-ray imaging for flow measurements during the CFT. Hence, the CFT was used along with a distance measuring ultrasonic sensor for testing asphalt mixtures with different characteristics. The test results confirmed that an ultrasonic sensor could be effective for capturing the differences of the flow behavior of asphalt mixtures tested by the CFT.   In addition, a parametric study with the X-ray setup was carried out to examine the capability of the CFT in reflecting the possible changes of the flow behavior in asphalt mixtures due to the change of construction parameters such as lift thickness, bottom roughness and compaction modes. The results obtained also confirmed the capability of the CFT in showing the possible differences in the flow behavior of the mixtures under the chosen conditions. The encouraging results suggested that the CFT may have potential to become a simple but effective tool for assessing compactability of the mixtures on-site, right after production in an asphalt plant or before placing the mixture on the road. Hence, discrete element method (DEM) was utilized to understand both the influence of selected boundaries of the CFT and the effect of its design on the results. As one specific example of application, an investigation was carried out using the CFT to find the most suitable tracking method for flow measurements in the field. Based on the literature review and feasibility tests, a tracking method with the highest potential for conducting flow measurements during field compaction was introduced. X-ray radiography confirmed the validity of the results obtained with the suggested method. The overall results obtained from this study suggest that the recommended CFT along with the suggested field tracking method may be helpful in building up a comprehensive basis of knowledge on the flow and compaction behavior of asphalt mixtures thus helping to close the gap between the field and laboratory.

40|$|Cement asphalt (CA) paste is an organic–inorganic {{composite}} material of cement and asphalt emulsion. Its complicated rheological behavior affects its site application in high speed railway. Superplasticizers (SPs) are usually {{used to improve}} the construction properties of fresh CA mortar. However, the principle of SPs acting on the rheology of CA paste is seldom studied. In this paper, the effects of polycarboxylate (PCA) and naphthalenesulfonate (PNS) on the rheological properties of CA pastes, asphalt emulsions (both anionic and cationic) and cement pastes were studied, respectively {{from the viewpoint of}} adsorption and zeta potential. Centrifugation method was used to determine the adsorption of <b>asphalt</b> onto cement <b>particle,</b> electroacoustic method was employed to study the zeta potential of cement particles of concentrated paste, and optical microscopy was used to observe the dispersion of particles. The results suggest that both PCA and PNS can decrease the yield stress and apparent viscosity of CA pastes. The effect of SPs on the rheology of CA paste can be explained by two reasons. First, PNS can adsorb on both asphalt and cement surface, change the zeta potential and then decrease their yield stress and viscosity, while PCA only adsorb on cement surface. Second, the competitive adsorption of SPs and asphalt prevents asphalt from adsorbing on cement surface and then more asphalt droplets are released into aqueous solution, thereby enhancing the particle dispersion...|$|R

Gritting sand is being used during snowy winter conditions as atraction control method. During spring season, when snow and ice melt and surfacesdry out, and the influence of traffic, <b>asphalt</b> surface wear, <b>particle</b> ejection from tires,etc; under the effect of their interaction, cause the formation of particulate matter. A general aim {{of this study was to}} perform analysis of factors which can be consideredresponsible generating road pollution, with resistance to abrasion of gritting sandbeing a potential key problem. The correlation between the use of studded tires andparticulate matter formation has been considered to be one of major issues in urbanareas. In order to carry out this investigation, an individual study case was considered,measurements indicated that levels of pollution increased even after studded tires werebanned. The literature review revealed important knowledge gaps regarding the quantificationof particulate emissions from non-exhaust sources, most importantly, emissions due tolow quality gritting sanding. At this point, very little information is available thatcould be used for determining the resistance to abrasion of gritting sanding material. This is further supported by numerous institutions and companies, all suggesting thatquality of gritting sand is not taken into consideration.
