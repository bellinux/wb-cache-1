5|$|Macroolithus eggs {{have been}} found {{containing}} oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling Heyuannia. Multiple other <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> oviraptorid and elongatoolithids (including other eggs containing embryos, parents brooding on nests, {{and a pair of}} shelled Macroolithus-like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid's pelvis) confirm that the parent of Macroolithus was an oviraptorid.|$|E
5|$|In genetics, a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals {{to see if any}} variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} prey upon similar food {{resources}} include the caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores. Gymnotids, {{such as the}} electric eel, and the large silurid catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two river dolphins, the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> giant otters and the Amazon river dolphins, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The spectacled caiman is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) {{demonstrate}} that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did not refer the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, they noted that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because the shell had not finished forming when the mother died, or because of biochemical dissolution of the shell before fossilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

As far as the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> economic performance and pollution disclosures is concerned, the results show that the subgroup of large firms with poor economic performance provides the most detailed pollution information. For smaller firms there is no <b>association</b> <b>between</b> economic performance and pollution disclosures. ...|$|R

The results indicate that there is a negative direct <b>association</b> <b>between</b> instrumental and normative commitment and PEU but no significant direct <b>association</b> <b>between</b> affective commitment and PEU (however there is a strong indirect effect). The conclusions drawn are that feelings of attachment, obligation and perceived need (affective, normative and instrumental commitment respectively) dissipate in environments perceived to be turbulent.

40|$|International {{collaboration}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly significant issue in science. During the last few years, {{a large number of}} bibliometric studies of co-authorships have been reported. Mostly, these studies have concentrated on country-to-country collaboration, revealing general patterns of interaction. In this study we analyze international collaborative patterns as indicated in the Indian publications by tracking out multi author publications as given in Science Citation Index (SCI) database. Correspondence analysis is used for analysis and interpretation of the results. According to correspondence analysis of the data set, Physics, Chemistry, Clinical medicine are the first, second and third largest subjects having international collaboration. USA, Italy, Germany, France, England are the top five countries with which India is collaborating. The data set shows an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Physics and Italy, Switzerland, Algeria, Finland, South Korea, Russia, Netherlands contrasting an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Biology & Biochemistry, Immunology, Ecology & Environment, Geosciences, Multidisciplinary subjects and England, Japan, Canada.

An <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Clinical medicine, Astrophysics and England, Sweden, USA, New Zealand in contrast to an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Agriculture and Canada, Philippines, Denmark is shown. An <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Neuroscience and Singapore, Canada, USA in contrast to an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> Chemistry, Astrophysics and Malaysia, Spain is shown.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} in the literature {{that there is a}} positive relationship between unexpected earnings and subsequent abnormal returns. There has been little research as to whether current unexpected earnings influence investment decisions which are known to be associated with abnormal returns. The objective of this dissertation is to test whether unexpected changes in earnings are associated with changes in investment, and then whether changes in investment are associated with abnormal returns. Specifically, the empirical tests examine (i) the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> investment and subsequent unexpected earnings, (ii) the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> unexpected earnings and subsequent changes in investment, and (iii) the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> changes in investment and abnormal security returns. The results are mixed. The results do not support an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> investment and subsequent unexpected earnings. The results also fail to support an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> changes in actual investment and abnormal security returns. The evidence is generally consistent with a positive <b>association</b> <b>between</b> unexpected earnings and subsequent changes in investment. This association is stronger for firms with available debt capacity...|$|R
