However, although substantial efforts have been devoted to global analyses of the {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and other long-lived GHGs, <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions have received only limited attention in the global context. Past and likely future trends in <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions evolve rather differently from those of long-lived GHGs, so that superficial extrapolations of GHG trends would lead to misleading conclusions. In many world regions, the evolution of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions has effectively decoupled from economic growth. Since 1990, <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions declined (sulfur dioxide, SO 2), stabilized (nitrogen oxides, NOx), or increased slightly (black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC; and ammonia, NH 3). This review discusses to what extent structural changes, technological improvements, and dedicated environmental legislation have contributed to these changes. The scenarios of future emissions in the literature span a wide range, mainly owing to different assumptions about future environmental policies. Although the more recent scenarios <b>agree</b> on declining <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> up to 2030, avoiding potential rebounds of emissions after 2030 will require additional policy interventions...|$|R

In this paper, the spatial-temporal distributions of major <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in Shenzhen from March 2013 to February 2014 are discussed. In this study, ground-site monitoring data from 19 monitoring sites was used and spatial interpolation and spatial autocorrelation methods {{were applied to}} analyze both spatial and temporal characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in Shenzhen City. During the study period, the daily average concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5) ranged from 16 – 189 μg/m 3 and 10 – 136 μg/m 3, respectively, with 13 and 44 over-limit days, indicating that particulate matter was the primary <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> in Shenzhen.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} problems are attracting increasing attention, especially among developing countries with frequent haze events. Renewable energy {{sources such as}} wind power are expected to help relieve such environmental concerns. However, air pollution issues under such a changing energy structure receive inadequate attention. Mostly, constraints for total pollutant emissions are considered in unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch (ED) problems. In this paper, we propose a UC model with wind power that considers the dispersion of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The dispersion process is described by models involving meteorological conditions and the system’s geographical distribution, to estimate the spatial distribution of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> i. e. the concentration of ground-level <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> at monitored locations such as load centers. A penalty cost is introduced based on this estimation. Particulate matter 2. 5 micrometers or less in diameter, the major <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concerning most developing countries, is selected {{as the focus of}} this work. To properly estimate and sufficiently utilize the benefits of wind power for <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> dispersion control, robust optimization is applied to accommodate wind power uncertainty. Case studies justify this consideration of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> dispersion, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for improving load centers’ air pollution control and utilizing wind power benefits. postprin...|$|R

In this paper, we identify the spatio-temporal (ST) causalities among <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> at different locations by mining the urban big data. This is challenging for two reasons: 1) since <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> can be generated locally or dispersed from the neighborhood, we need to discover the causes in the ST space from many candidate locations with time efficiency; 2) the cause-and-effect relations between <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are further affected by confounding variables like meteorology. To tackle these problems, we propose a coupled Gaussian Bayesian model with two components: 1) a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) to represent the cause-and-effect relations among <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> with an entropy-based algorithm to efficiently locate the causes in the ST space; 2) a coupled model that combines cause-and-effect relations with meteorology to better learn the parameters while eliminating the impact of confounding. The proposed model is verified using air quality and meteorological data from 52 cities over the period Jun 1 st 2013 to May 1 st 2015.
