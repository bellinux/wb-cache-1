50|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I, concern for the {{security}} of the canal saw the first airborne forces of the Army being sent to the Canal Zone. Plans were made for the establishment of eight <b>aeronautical</b> <b>stations,</b> with a strength of two dirigibles and six or eight seaplanes for observation. The only site identified as immediately usable was at Coco Solo, near Colon. An emergency appropriation of $1,000,000 was rushed though Congress for this purpose. In addition to the airdrome, the facility would also house a Naval submarine base.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, a {{teletype}} service connected MMMO to Clark Air Force Base, US Naval Station Sangley Point and the Bureau of Telecommunications (precursor to {{the current}} National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines). Moreover, Exchange of weather reports with foreign countries, aircraft-in-flight and four <b>aeronautical</b> <b>stations</b> in the country - Laoag, Legazpi, Cebu & Zamboanga began at this year. Private radio systems and the then National Civil Defense Administration also helped to facilitate the reception of data and dissemination of the forecasts and warnings. In 1954, radio transmissions of time signals (which were done seven times daily) began in the geophysical observatory (which was now called Astronomical Observatory at this time).|$|R

50|$|By November 1913, the Navy Department had {{assigned}} Cunningham (and Smith) {{to return}} to the Advanced Base School with the understanding that they would create an aviation section for the force. Cunningham performed important reconnaissance roles for the force, which was fully functionable by 1914. Later, he served on a board, headed by Captain Washington I. Chambers, USN, tasked with drawing up a comprehensive plan for the organization of a naval aeronautical service. It was upon the recommendation of that board that the Naval <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Station</b> at Pensacola, Florida, was established in 1914.|$|E

In 1917, Snook eventually gained entry into the Curtiss-Wright Aviation School and put in many hours in the air until civilian flights in the United States were banned for the duration of World War I. Briefly, in 1918, she worked for the British Air Ministry in Elmira as an expeditor putting her mechanical skills to good use, inspecting and testing aircraft parts and engines on their way to combat in Europe.|$|E
