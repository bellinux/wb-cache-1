40|$|Abstract The {{ultrastructure}} of amyloid fibrils in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) was dearly demonstrated. Amyloid {{of three}} patients with FAP {{caused by the}} point mutation of the 30 th amino acid of transthyretin (ATTR VaBOMet) and one patient with FAP caused by two point mutations of the 30 th and 104 th amino acid of transthyretin (ATTR Val 30 Met/Argl 04 Cys) were partially isolated, stained negatively and examined with an electron microscope. Amyloid fibrils of both types were composed of two protofila-ments and twisted at 180 ° {{to the right and}} left alternately with a periodicity of 125 - 135 nm. This is the first report demonstrating such unique <b>alternating</b> <b>twist</b> structure of amyloid fibrils. There were no ultrastructural differences between the fibrils caused by the ATTR VaBOMet and ATTR Val 30 Met/ ArglO 4 His; therefore, it is suggested that the point mutation of the 30 th amino acid of transthyretin might {{play an important role in}} the formation of amyloid fibrils. Further biochemical study on the mechanism of this <b>alternating</b> <b>twist</b> formation should be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|We use {{scanning}} tunneling microscope (STM) {{manipulation and}} density functional theory calculation to investigate the structural properties of individual sexiphenyl molecules physisorbed on a Ag(111) surface at 6 K. The molecule−surface atomic registry is precisely determined by using atomic markers and a sexiphenyl functionalized tip. The calculations confirm the <b>alternating</b> <b>twist</b> of the sexiphenyl ð-rings on Ag(111). The ð-ring torsional angle, 11. 4 °, is directly determined from the geometry of STM manipulation. This innovative experiment opens up a novel application of STM manipulation to probe the properties of “physisorbed ” species on surfaces at the atomic level. The rapid progress in nanoscience creates the possibility of building molecular electronic devices at the single-molecule level. 1 - 8 Sexiphenyl, an oligomer group molecule, is in-tensely studied by many research groups 9 - 20 due to its potential application in light emission device fabrication.

We have determined {{in this way the}} structure of a fully alternating (Y-R) decanucleotide d(CGTATATACG) by single crystal X-ray diffraction. This is the first oligonucleotide crystal structure with an alternating 5 '-(TA) 3 - 3 ' central part. Alternating oligonucleotides have a particular interest since they often have a unique structure. In this case the general conformation is B-like with an <b>alternating</b> <b>twist</b> and an end-to-end interaction which involves terminal guanines. The crystal belongs to space group P 41212 with a = b = 52. 46, c = 101. 49 A. This packing imposes a 90 degrees crossing of the symmetry related helices. This is a new way of packing for decamers. The oligonucleotide structure is characterized by the specific association with seven nickel ions, involving the N 7 atom of every guanine.

40|$|Lecturepg. 81 - 92 The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has a growing demand for electrically driven trains operated at variable speeds. Variable frequency electrical drives enable increased operation flexibility and energy efficiency. This is of great importance in applications requiring high power, such as gas compression. Load commutated inverters (LCIs) are on of the most widespread technologies for driving large gas compression trains because of excellent reliability records. One drawback of power electronics driven systems is the generation of nonfundamental air-gap torque ripple components due to electrical harmonics. The air-gap torque ripple can interact with the mechanical system at torsional natural frequencies of the drive train. Torsional vibration is an oscillatory angular motion that causes <b>alternating</b> <b>twisting</b> in shaft sections and machinery couplings. A consequence of uncontrolled excited torsional vibration may be a protective trip of the motor, to prevent mechanical damage, such as a failed coupling or a broken shaft. This paper discusses illustrative design details of applying a torsional mode damping control system to LCI driven multi-Megawatt centrifugal gas compressors. The coincidence of electrical drive harmonics and torsional natural frequencies of the mechanical system is sometimes unavoidable due to the large variable speed range of the compressor such as for process requirements. For these types of applications, a power electronic damping system technology can be applies to new units or as a retrofit solution to existing variable speed trains. The so-called integrated torsional mode damping ITMD unit is based on a torsional vibration measurement in the mechanical system and an interface to the existing inverter control of the drive system. The dc-link inductor of the LCI is partially used as an integrated energy storage unit and is combined with a smart damping controller, which reacts to a torsional vibration by modulating a small amount of the stored energy and sending it to the motor without impacting the normal operation of the system. As a result, the active power modulation at a torsional natural frequency of the mechanical system has a strong damping effect for torsional vibrations. Intensive simulations and several tests were performed on large LCIs (up to 50 MW) over the last three years. Selected experiments results will be presented and discussed to validate the suggested damping system...|$|R

40|$|Coalescence is an {{essential}} phenomenon that governs the equilibrium behaviour {{in a variety of}} systems from intercellular transport to planetary formation. In this report, we study co-alescence pathways of circularly shaped two-dimensional colloidal membranes, which are one rod-length-thick liquid-like monolayers of aligned rods. The chirality of the constituent rods leads to three atypical coalescence pathways that are not found in other simple or complex fluids. In particular, we characterize two pathways that do not proceed to completion but instead produce partially joined membranes connected by line defects—p-wall defects or <b>alternating</b> arrays of <b>twisted</b> bridges and pores. We elucidate the structure and energetics of these defects and ascribe their stability to a geometrical frustration inherently present in chiral colloidal membranes.

We work to next-to-leading order (NLO) in a power counting scheme in which m_q a Λ_QCD^ 2, with m_q the physical quark mass and a the lattice spacing. We argue that automatic O(a) improvement of physical quantities at maximal twist, which has been demonstrated in general if m_q >> a Λ_QCD^ 2, holds even if m_q a Λ_QCD^ 2, {{as long as one}} uses an appropriate non-perturbative definition of the twist angle. We demonstrate this with explicit calculations, for arbitrary twist angle, of all pionic quantities that involve no more than a single pion in the initial and final states: masses, decay constants, form factors and condensates, as well as the differences between <b>alternate</b> definitions of <b>twist</b> angle. We also calculate the axial and pseudoscalar form factors of the pion, quantities which violate flavor and parity, and which vanish in the continuum limit. These are of interest because they are not automatically O(a) improved at maximal twist. They allow a determination of the unknown low energy constants introduced by discretization errors, and provide tests of the accuracy of ChPT at NLO. We extend our results into the regime where m_q a^ 2 Λ_QCD^ 3, and argue in favor of a recent proposal that automatic O(a) improvement at maximal twist remains valid in this regime.

60|$|Before passing {{to other}} classes of facts, {{it should be}} {{observed}} that {{the evolution of the}} homogeneous into the heterogeneous is displayed not only in the separation of Painting and Sculpture from Architecture and from each other, and in the greater variety of subjects they embody, but it is further shown in the structure of each work. A modern picture or statue is of far more heterogeneous nature than an ancient one. An Egyptian sculpture-fresco represents all its figures as on one plane--that is, at the same distance from the eye; and so is less heterogeneous than a painting that represents them as at various distances from the eye. It exhibits all objects as exposed to the same degree of light; and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which exhibits different objects and different parts of each object as in different degrees of light. It uses scarcely any but the primary colours, and these in their full intensity; and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which, introducing the primary colours but sparingly, employs an endless variety of intermediate tints, each of heterogeneous composition, and differing from the rest not only in quality but in intensity. Moreover, we see in these earliest works a great uniformity of conception. The same arrangement of figures is perpetually reproduced--the same actions, attitudes, faces, dresses. In Egypt the modes of representation were so fixed that it was sacrilege to introduce a novelty; and indeed it could have been only in consequence of a fixed mode of representation that a system of hieroglyphics became possible. The Assyrian bas-reliefs display parallel characters. Deities, kings, attendants, winged figures and animals, are severally depicted in like positions, holding like implements, doing like things, and with like expression or non-expression of face. If a palm-grove is introduced, all the trees are of the same height, have the same number of leaves, and are equidistant. When water is imitated, each wave is a counterpart of the rest; and the fish, almost always of one kind, are evenly distributed over the surface. The beards of the kings, the gods, and the winged figures, are every where similar: as are the names of the lions, and equally so those of the horses. Hair is represented throughout by one form of curl. The king's beard is quite architecturally built up of compound tiers of uniform curls, <b>alternating</b> with <b>twisted</b> tiers placed in a transverse direction, and arranged with perfect regularity; and the terminal tufts of the bulls' tails are represented in exactly the same manner. Without tracing out analogous facts in early Christian art, in which, though less striking, they are still visible, the advance in heterogeneity will be sufficiently manifest on remembering that in the pictures of our own day the composition is endlessly varied; the attitudes, faces, expressions, unlike; the subordinate objects different in size, form, position, texture; and more or less of contrast even in the smallest details. Or, if we compare an Egyptian statue, seated bolt upright on a block with hands on knees, fingers outspread and parallel, eyes looking straight forward, and the two sides perfectly symmetrical in every particular, with a statue of the advanced Greek or the modern school, which is asymmetrical in respect of the position of the head, the body, the limbs, the arrangement of the hair, dress, appendages, and in its relations to neighbouring objects, we shall see the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous clearly manifested.|$|R

Many critics hear a heavy Melvins-influence in the songs of White Mice, a point which could be supported by the White Mice's love of heavy, sludgy sounds; however, what separates White Mice from this obvious influence is their almost painterly use of noise - they actually rock an oscillator to create whirling harsh soundscapes - and wickedly good basslines.
