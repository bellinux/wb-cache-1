30|$|The {{licensed}} Ethernet Media Access Controller (TEMAC) core is used {{to develop}} Ethernet communications. Two DSP 48 E slices are used to rectify left and right images, respectively. The {{results show that the}} logic resources consumption are dominated by the stereo <b>matching</b> <b>module</b> due to its high number of aggregations, while the rectification and post processing require slightly less logic.

On the other hand, increasing image resolution has little effect on the resources consumption, since our architecture is based on the local pixel processing.

40|$|The queries to a {{practical}} Question Answering (QA) system range from keywords, phrases, badly written questions, and occasionally grammatically perfect questions. Among {{different kinds of}} question analysis approaches, the pattern matching works well in analyzing such queries. It is costly to build this pattern <b>matching</b> <b>module</b> because tremendous manual labor is needed to expand its coverage to so many variations in natural language questions. This thesis proposes that the costly manual labor should be saved by the technique of paraphrase generation which can automatically generate semantically similar paraphrases of a natural language question. Previous approaches of paraphrase generation either require large scale of corpus and the dependency parser, or only deal with the relation-entity type of simple question queries. By introducing a method of inferring transformation operations between paraphrases, and a description of sentence structure, this thesis develops a paraphrase generation method and its implementation in Chinese with very limited amount of corpus. The evaluation results of this implementation show its ability to aid humans to efficiently create a pattern <b>matching</b> <b>module</b> for QA systems as it greatly outperforms the human editors in the coverage of natural language questions, with an acceptable precision in generated paraphrases...|$|R

This paper also presents an architecture for the workflow system, which is driven by ontologies that capture semantic relationships between workflows, re-sources and users. The focus is on the <b>matching</b> <b>module</b> instance, the component responsible for finding alternatives for workflows, resources and users. ...|$|R
