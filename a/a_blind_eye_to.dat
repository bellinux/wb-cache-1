5000|$|The {{two female}} protagonists, Hsiu and Hui-hua, {{have not yet}} {{surrendered}} their dreams when we observe them in the initial sequences of the film. But {{it is clear that}} they cannot escape the pressures of village society. Whatever their subjective longings, how can they turn <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> the expectations of their next of kin that are anchored in tradition? We see that these expectations are in turn influenced by social customs and by fear of gossip among neighbors. But also by the spontaneous comprehension that social roles have to be accepted if families want to make ends meet and if the local economy of a fishing village is to function ‘as it always did.’ ...|$|R

Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000.

The British Film Institute's Screenonline said: [...] "As in {{his previous}} television work, including his adaptation of Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now which drew parallels between its ruthless Victorian entrepreneur hero and modern media tycoons, and the fine conspiracy thriller, State of Play, director David Yates gives a thrilling and complicated narrative a strong social and political dimension. The brutality of brothel life is tellingly juxtaposed with the ethics of Boston business, which is lavish with its charity while turning <b>a</b> knowingly <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> corruption...

5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators turned <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam.

In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have turned <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power.

The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as co-respondent in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913.|$|E
30|$|The {{rate of the}} {{expansion}} of LSMA to 17.6 % of the communal rangeland in Butana did not occur evenly. The most rapid expansion occurred from 2009 to 2014 (Figures  3 and 4). This rapid expansion showed {{a continuation of the}} government’s practice of turning <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye,</b> attributable <b>to</b> the absolute power of LSFs in Gadarif State {{as well as to the}} marginalization of local land users. LSFs in Gadarif State have succeeded in building power from the community to the regional and national levels (Egemi 2008; Sulieman 2015). Babiker (2013) mentioned that the scarcity of available land in central and southern zones has meant that Butana rangeland became an alternative option for expansion in recent decades even though land-use planning had not allowed for LSMA.|$|R

5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained {{that he had been}} there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} turn <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him {{out of the room and}} confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E

Kluttig and Reineboth, two other SS officers, realize that Zweiling was the informant, but choose to ignore it; they begin to search for the child. Kluttig is keen on massacring the camp's surviving prisoners, but commandant Schwahl forbids it, fearing American retribution - although he knows of the secret resistance. Kluttig and Reineboth brutally torture Höfel and Kropinski, but they refuse to tell the boy's whereabouts. The resistance's leaders meet to discuss the crisis, that may bring about an SS crackdown before their planned uprising. They determine to save the child, who is hidden in a barrack.|$|R

5000|$|The phrase <b>to</b> turn <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> is {{attributed}} <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{incident in the}} life of Admiral Horatio Nelson.

During the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 the cautious Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in overall command of the British forces, sent a signal to Nelson's forces ordering them to discontinue the action.

When this order was brought to the more aggressive Nelson's attention, he lifted his telescope up <b>to</b> his <b>blind</b> <b>eye,</b> saying, [...] "I really do not see the signal," [...] and most of his forces continued to press home the attack.

40|$|James Joyce’s Ulysses rewrites the Homeric Odyssey {{in such a}} {{way that}} the ancient myth {{provides}} a structural pattern, which gives order and meaning to a seemingly chaotic and meaningless contemporary world – an aspect which T. S. Eliot called the “mythical method”. As the characters of Ulysses are ignorant of this ordering device, they function as Jungian archetypes rather than individuals: Their deeds correspond to a mythical framework which is not actively remembered but provides a collective unconsciousness that guides their lives as a principle of order and continuity. What they do is meaningful although they consider themselves as insignificant agents thrown into a seemingly chaotic world. Whereas scholars have focused on Homer’s Odyssey as an archetypal (i. e. collective unconscious) key to the cultural memory of the mythical roots of Western culture, they have turned <b>a</b> comparatively <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Homer’s corresponding work of the Iliad has a similar function for the mythopoetic design of Ulysses. This paper is going to reconstruct Joyce’s neglected intertextual dialogue with the Iliad as an archetypal key to the cultural memory of the roots of Western civilisation...|$|R
40|$|Repressive states pose a {{conundrum}} {{for human}} rights nongovernmental organizations and development advocates alike. Many UN and OECD donors claim that human rights are essential for successful development, but if rights-based conditionality is applied too rigorously, recipient states may refuse aid, resulting in increased hardship for their populations. It is this dilemma that is posed by the case of Ethiopia, one of the world’s top receivers of foreign aid. Western, Japanese, and UN donors have turned <b>a</b> seemingly <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> Ethiopian government repression in favor of maintaining the momentum of development projects. Many of these same development projects, however, {{are being used to}} repress and control the Ethiopian population. Evidence suggests that foreign aid has limited potential to influence regime behavior and there is a danger that Ethiopia may turn completely to China, which requires no human rights conditions, as an alternative source of development aid if Western, UN, and Japanese sources apply human rights conditionality too strictly. This paper argues that the role of human rights NGOs in this situation is to push donors to include human rights conditionality in their development, but to do so judiciously so that aid is not refused. NGOs can help donors to develop effective and realistic human rights benchmarks to measure progress in recipient states...|$|R
