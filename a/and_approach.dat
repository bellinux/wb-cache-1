5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

5|$|Many {{coaches have}} been {{influenced}} by Dodd's style <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> to the game, including Vince Dooley, University of Georgia's longtime football coach, who was the first recipient of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.

Broyles led the Razorbacks to 14-7 victory over the Yellow Jackets in the 1960 Gator Bowl, which was the first bowl game Georgia Tech had lost with Bobby Dodd as head coach.|$|E

5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E

5|$|The {{other major}} reagent is a camphor-derived reagent {{developed}} by Varinder Aggarwal of the University of Bristol.

As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX.

5|$|By mid-July, Gilligan {{had been}} named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia {{at the end of}} the English cricket season, and was {{expected}} to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. Two players in the England team during the South Africa series spoke out against his tactics: Cec Parkin published a highly critical article in the press and never played for England again; George Macaulay clashed with Gilligan on the field during one Test. The consequent absence of both men from the tour substantially weakened the bowling strength of the team. Although Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press believed Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics <b>and</b> <b>approach.</b> Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had first asked Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.|$|E

5|$|Having {{staged a}} coup of New York after {{spreading}} his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts Otto, angry {{that he was}} cheated out {{of the opportunity to}} defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him.

When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, the Goblin King quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as the CEO of Alchemax and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Norman Osborn has become too publicly known as a supervillain.
