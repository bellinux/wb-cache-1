50|$|An <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> is ectopic {{salivary gland}} tissue with a salivary gland duct system. The most common {{location}} of <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> tissue is an extra major salivary gland {{in front of}} the parotid gland. It is typically about 3 cm or less in size, and drains into the parotid duct via a single tributary. Accessory parotid tissue is found in 21-56% of adults.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of barley yellow dwarf {{vary with the}} affected crop cultivar, {{the age of the}} plant at the time of infection, the strain of the virus, and environmental conditions, and can be confused with other disease or physiological disorders. Symptoms appear approximately 14 days after infection. Affected plants show a yellowing or reddening of leaves (on oats and some wheats), stunting, an upright posture of thickened stiff leaves, reduced root growth, delayed (or no) heading, and a reduction in yield. The heads of affected plants tend to remain erect and become black and discoloured during ripening due to colonization by saprotrophic fungi. Young plants are the most susceptible.The virus is transmitted from the phloem when the aphid feeds. When the aphid feeds, virions go to the aphid's hind gut, the coat protein of the virus is recognised by the hindgut epithelium, and the virion is allowed to pass into the insect's hemolymph, where it can remain indefinitely, but the virus cannot reproduce inside the aphid. The virus is actively transported into the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> to be released into salivary canals and ducts. The virus is then excreted in the aphid saliva during its next feeding.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and secretory {{activity of the}} <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> in two species of Conus were examined using routine and histochemical techniques of light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The composite layers of the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> of Conus are a luminal epithelium, fibromuscular layer, submuscular layer, and a capsule. In C. flavidus and C. vexillum, the luminal epithelium is formed by epitheliocytes and cytoplasmic processes extending from the secretory cells, whose perikarya form the submuscular layer. The processes carry secretory cell products (chiefly Golgi‐derived glycoprotein) across the fibromuscular layer and terminate between epitheliocytes (at the bases of the secretory canaliculi) or beyond {{the surface of the}} epithelial cells. Conus vexillum is distinguished from C. flavidus by its high content of lipofuscin. Epitheliocytes are the only microvillated cells in the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> of Conus. In C. flavidus, epitheliocytes extrude secretory granules, various types of cytoplasmic blebs and clear vesicles by apocrine “pinching off”. Clear vesicles are shed from the tips of microvilli. The luminal epithelial cells of C. vexillum similarly egest clear vesicles, but normally undergo additional holocrine secretion to release lipofuscin. The secretions of epitheliocytes appear to be major products of the accessory salivary gland: consideration of secretory activities by both epitheliocytes and secretory cells will therefore be necessary when directly investigating <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> function in Conus.

Although we agree {{that the use of}} anticholinergic medication represents a treatment, it requires the patient to have residual salivary gland function. Unfortunately, it is well established that in most cases radiotherapy destroys most of the salivary gland and associated salivary secretions. In these condi-tions, one therapeutic approach is to generate saliva by stimulating accessory salivary glands which are more resistant to radiation. This is due to histological differences between the main and <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland.</b> Thus, the accessory salivary glands have a short excretory duct, slightly or not branched whereas the main salivary glands, which are clearly differentiated, provide a larger intrinsic surface to radia-tion.

Case Report: A 26 -year-old Caucasian man was referred for management of unilateral visual loss {{together with a}} paracentral scotoma developing 2 weeks after a flu-like syndrome. Clinical signs and ancillary diagnostic investigations suggested APMPPE. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels. Chest CT-scan disclosed moderate hilar lymph node calcifications but QuantiFERON-TB gold test was negative and bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsies were unremarkable. <b>Accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> biopsy disclosed epithelioid and gigantocellular granuloma formation without caseum, confirming a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

[URL] in {{the family}} Luteoviridae are strictly transmitted by aphids in a non-propagative, circulative and persistent mode. Virions ingested by aphids successively cross the gut and the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> epithelia before being released, together with saliva, into the plant vasculature. Virion transport through aphid cells occurs by a transcytosis mechanism. This study conducted a transcriptomic analysis of intestinal genes of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum following uptake of pea enation mosaic virus. Among the 7166 transcripts analysed, 128 were significantly regulated (105 genes downregulated and 23 upregulated). Of these genes, 5 % were involved in intracellular trafficking, endocytosis and signal transduction, three important steps in the internalization and transport of virions. The limited levels of downregulation (maximum of 3. 45 -fold) and upregulation (maximum of 1. 37 -fold) suggest that the virus hijacks a constitutive endocytosis–exocytosis mechanism without heavily perturbing cell metabolism. Although limited to about 20 % of the pea aphid genes, this work represents the first large-scale analysis of aphid gene regulation following virus acquisition. A better knowledge of this virus–vector interaction will be possible only when tools representing the complete genomic capacity of the aphid become available...|$|E

40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{abilities of}} stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) to colonize {{a diverse group}} of plants have been attributed to the feeding behaviors and the functions of the salivary complex of these insects. Here, we describe the ultrastructure of the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, which is a major component of the pentatomid pest complex on soybeans, Glycine max, in the neotropics. Our results revealed a salivary gland complex consisting of two lobes (i. e., anterior and posterior), with a constriction between them (i. e., the hilum), in which the salivary and accessory gland ducts are inserted. The principal gland epithelium has a single layer of cells lining an enlarged lumen filled with saliva, and these cells are cuboidal, rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles, with well-developed nuclei, all of which are typical features of protein-secreting cells. We report, {{for the first time in}} insects, the presence of a layer of muscle cells surrounding the columnar hilum epithelium. The <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> cells are cuboidal with nuclei containing condensed chromatin and cytoplasm rich in vacuoles and rough endoplasmic reticulum, indicating the potential involvement of these glands in water transport/secretion. The lumen content of each lobe of the principal gland suggests that the lobes produce different compounds.

40|$|Point {{mutations}} {{were introduced}} into or near five conserved sequence motifs of the readthrough {{domain of the}} beet western yellows virus minor capsid protein P 74. The mutant virus was tested {{for its ability to}} accumulate efficiently in agroinfected plants and to be transmitted by its aphid vector, Myzus persicae. The stability of the mutants in the agroinfected and aphid-infected plants was followed by sequence analysis of the progeny virus. Only the mutation Y 201 D was found to strongly inhibit virus accumulation in planta following agroinfection, but high accumulation levels were restored by reversion or pseudoreversion at this site. Four of the five mutants were poorly aphid transmissible, but in three cases successful transmission was restored by pseudoreversion or second-site mutations. The same second-site mutations in the nonconserved motif PVT(32 - 34) were shown to compensate for two distinct primary mutations (R 24 A and E 59 A/D 60 A), one {{on each side of the}} PVT sequence. In the latter case, a second-site mutation in the PVT motif restored the ability of the virus to move from the hemocoel through the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> following microinjection of mutant virus into the aphid hemocoel but did not permit virus movement across the epithelium separating the intestine from the hemocoel.

40|$|ABSTRACT Small cell neuroendocrine {{carcinoma}} (SCNEC) of the {{paranasal sinuses}} is extremely rare, with an unclear pathogenesis. The presence of neuroendocrine granules is suggestive of neuroendocrine differentiation. It {{was reported that}} this disease relates {{to the presence of}} <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>glands,</b> and some basic research has shown that it might originate from the multi-potent stem cells. There are no specific clinical symptoms but rhinal and ophthalmological symptoms are found in most cases. Diagnosis mainly depends on histopathological manifestations, immunohistochemical results and features of the electron microscopic ultra-structure. Pathological differentiation from poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma, melanoma, esthesioneuroblastoma and neuroglioma etc. is needed. No unifi ed regimen has been employed in treating the disease. At present, combined therapy has a manifest therapeutic effect, such as success with the 2003 French regimen. Tumor relapse is common and prognosis is poor. A complete combined treatment plan will be helpful to improve the prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Sjögren’s {{syndrome}} (SS) is {{a chronic}} disorder affecting primarily exocrine glands associated with lymphocytic infiltrates. The most common renal disease in SS is tubulo-interstitial nephritis, responsible for {{renal tubular acidosis}} (RTA) in 20 % of the patients. It is often latent and can be rarely complicated by osteomalacia. Case presentation: A 40  year-old woman with no medical history, was admitted for lower limb weakness and inability to walk for six months. She had a waddling gait and reported pain upon palpation of the bones. No arthritis was found and neuromuscular examination was normal. The serum calcium (2. 13  mmol/L), phosphate (0. 68  mmol/L), potassium (2. 9  mmol/L) and bicarbonate (18  mmol/L) were low while the alkaline phosphate was elevated (200  IU/L). Protein electrophoresis showed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (40  g/L). Serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D was 8  μg/L. Urine was alkaline (Ph =  7) and analysis revealed proteinuria (0. 1  g/day), phosphaturia (11. 9  mmol/day; normal 22 – 42  mmol/day) and calciuria at 3  mmol/ 24  h (normal 2. 5 – 6  mmol/ 24  h). Plain X-ray revealed Looser’s zones on the left femoral neck. Whole-body bone scan showed multiple bone cracks in the rib cage, right clavicle and femur suggesting the diagnosis of osteomalacia. During evaluation, the patient reported dryness of the mouth and eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a superficial punctuated keratitis. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-SSA and anti-SSB were positive. <b>Accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration and the diagnosis osteomalacia related to distal RTA secondary to Sjögren’s syndrome was retained.

40|$|Poleroviruses are phloem-limited RNA viruses {{strictly}} {{transmitted by}} aphids in a circulative and non-propagative mode. Virus particles, acquired by aphids on infected plants, successively cross intestinal and <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> cells by transcytosis before being released, together with saliva, into a plant during aphid feeding. Virus transport through the epithelia {{relies on the}} presence of specific virus receptors. Identification of these receptors could eventually result in the development of innovative strategies to block virus acquisition by aphids. The Ephrin receptor (Ephr) from Myzus persicae has been reviously identified by yeast two hybrid as a potential partner of the structural proteins of Turnip yellows virus (TuYV, genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae). Ephr is a membrane protein involved in cell communication and endocytosis in mammalian cells. In order to address its function in TuYV transmission by M. persicae, we developed several strategies (1), all based on the RNA interference mechanism, to inhibit expression of Ephr in M. persicae. The oral acquisition of in vitro synthetized dsRNA targeting Ephr and the acquisition of dsRNA, or siRNA, from transgenic plants expressing an RNA hairpin, resulted in an inhibition of the accumulation of Ephr-mRNA in M. persicae. When fed on a viral source, these Ephr-silenced aphids showed a lower internalization of viral genomes into their body. Although the feeding behaviour and the fecundity of the Ephr-silenced aphids were not affected by the reduction of Ephr expression, TuYV transmission was reproducibly reduced. Preliminary experiments showed that transmission inhibition of another related polerovirus, the Beet mild yellowing virus, was also obtained when using Ephr-silenced aphids. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest implication of Ephr in polerovirus transmission. Whether Ephr encodes a true virus receptor or a co-receptor still needs to be elucidated...|$|E

Laboratory investigations revealed chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine of 2. 3 mg/dL and creatinine clearance of 40 mL/min, hypokalemia (3. 2 mmol/L), hypophosphatemia (0. 4 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (2. 14 mmol/L) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (chlorine: 114 mmol/L; alkaline reserve: 14 mmol/L). The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated. The serum levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25 -dihydroxy vitamin D were low and borderline low, respectively, and the parathyroid hormone level was 70 pg/L. Urinalysis showed inappropriate alkaline urine (urinary PH: 7), glycosuria with normal blood glucose, phosphaturia and uricosuria. These values indicated the presence of both distal and proximal RTA. Our patient reported dryness of the mouth and eyes and Schirmer′s test showed xerophthalmia. An <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> biopsy showed changes corresponding to stage IV of Chisholm and Masson score. Kidney biopsy showed diffuse and severe tubulo-interstitial nephritis with dense lymphoplasmocyte infiltrates. Sicca syndrome and renal interstitial infiltrates indicated SS as the underlying cause of the RTA and osteomalacia. The patient received alkalinization, vitamin D (Sterogyl ®), calcium supplements and steroids in an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day, tapered to 10 mg daily. The prognosis was favorable and the serum creatinine level was 1. 7 mg/dL, calcium was 2. 2 mmol/L and serum phosphate was 0. 9 mmol/L...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBeet western yellows virus (BWYV) is a Polerovirus {{that relies}} on the aphid Myzus persicae for its transmission, in a persistent-circulative mode. To be transmitted, the virus must cross the midgut and the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> (ASG) {{epithelial}} barriers in a transcytosis mechanism where vector receptors interact with virions. In this paper, we report in vitro interaction experiments between BWYV and aphid components. Using the M. persicae clone from Colmar, we showed that a set of aphid polypeptides, separated by SDS-PAGE or 2 D electrophoresis (2 DE), can bind in vitro to purified wild type or mutant particles. Using subcellular fractionation, we showed that the 65 -kDa polypeptide identified as symbionin is a soluble protein whereas the other polypeptides seem to be associated more or less strongly to the membrane. We hypothesize that three polypeptides, identified by mass spectrometry as Rack- 1, GAPDH 3, and actin, {{may be involved in}} the epithelial transcytosis of virus particles in the aphid vector...|$|R
40|$|Beet western yellows luteovirus is obligately {{transmitted}} by the aphid Myzus persicae in a circulative, non-propagative fashion. Virus movement across the epithelial {{cells of the}} digestive tube into the hemocoel and from the hemocoel into the <b>accessory</b> <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> is believed to occur by receptor-mediated endocytosis and exocytosis. Virions contain two types of protein; the major 22 kDa capsid protein and the minor read-through protein, P 74, which is composed of the major capsid protein fused by translational read-through to a long C-terminal extension called the read-through domain. Beet western yellows virus carrying various mutations in the read-through domain was tested {{for its ability to}} be transmitted to test plants by aphids fed on agro-infected plants and semi-purified or purified virus preparations. The results establish that the read-through domain carries determinants that are essential for aphid transmission. The findings also reveal that the read-through domain is important for accumulation of the virus in agro-infected plants...|$|R
