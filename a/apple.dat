When cooked, some <b>apple</b> cultivars easily form a puree known as <b>apple</b> sauce. Apples are also made into <b>apple</b> butter and <b>apple</b> jelly.

After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice <b>Apple</b> to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E

5|$|<b>Apple</b> scab: <b>Apple</b> scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture.

Proview Technology sued <b>Apple</b> over the {{rights to the}} mark in China in 2011; <b>Apple</b> counter-sued but lost and then appealed, with the case before the Xicheng district court, where Proview claimed $1.6 billion USD in damages. <b>Apple</b> paid Proview approximately $53,000 – $55,000 for the mark in 2009. In February 2012, Proview sued <b>Apple</b> in the Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging several permutations of fraud (intentional misrepresentation, concealment, inducement) and unfair competition. <b>Apple</b> paid $60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court-mediated settlement in the Higher People's Court of Guangdong province; the U.S. case was thrown out of court.|$|E

The logo in question featured the outline of an <b>apple</b> and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three bumps {{on top of the}} <b>apple</b> instead of the two used by <b>Apple,</b> and had no bite out of the <b>apple,</b> unlike Apple's logo.

5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core <b>Apple</b> A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new <b>Apple</b> A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the <b>Apple</b> A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the <b>Apple</b> A7 processor and the <b>Apple</b> M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the <b>Apple</b> A8X processor, the <b>Apple</b> M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the <b>Apple</b> A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which <b>Apple</b> will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of <b>Apple</b> Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by <b>Apple.</b> Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while <b>Apple</b> is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
