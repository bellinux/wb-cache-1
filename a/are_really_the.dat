5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E

25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between {{the advocates of}} the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use of}} w and y to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find y and w very difficult to learn, and that u and i are the 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u and i <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E

500|$|Two months later, the EPB granted an {{interview}} to Claridad, where the organization discussed its stance on several topics. The group opened by expressing that the 2009 administration change did little to the [...] " [...] neoliberal politics of both parties", claiming that both exploit demagogue to entice voters but that in reality they [...] "only serve the bourgeoisie of the United States of Puerto Rico, among which are the bankers, developers and contractors". However, the organization did differentiate Fortuño from his predecessor, claiming that that [...] "as a fervent servant of the Republican neoliberal capitalism" [...] he employed [...] "an strategy to downsize the government, privatize anything that is of interest to bond and capital holders and to eliminate all that is preserving {{the culture of the}} Puerto Rican nation alive". The Macheteros expressed concern that this administration wanted to portray the wealthy as the answer to the economic crisis, [...] "which <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> fault of all government administrations, including Mr. Fortuño's". The group also disregarded all measures adopted by the legislature, which in their view only responded to the economic interests of the wealthy, which they considered [...] "perhaps the worst of all" [...] and warning the PPD legislators led by Hector Ferrer that [...] "weak opposition [...] into accomplices".|$|E

2500|$|Walt Whitman(1819–1892) and Emily Dickinson (1830–1886), two of America's {{greatest}} 19th-century poets {{could hardly}} have been more different in temperament and style. Walt Whitman [...] was a working man, a traveler, a self-appointed nurse during the American Civil War (1861–1865), and a poetic innovator. His magnum opus was Leaves of Grass, in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of American democracy. Taking that motif one step further, the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being egotistical. For example, in Song of Myself, the long, central poem in Leaves of Grass, Whitman writes: [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hakka–Chinese {{scientist}} and researcher Dr. Siu-Leung Lee {{stated in the}} book by Chung Yoon-Ngan, The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes, that the potential Hakka origins from the northern Han and Xiongnu, {{and that of the}} indigenous southern She (畬族) and Yue (越族) tribes, [...] "are all correct, yet none alone explain the origin of the Hakka", pointing out that the problem with [...] "DNA typing" [...] on limited numbers of people within population pools cannot correctly ascertain who <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> southern Chinese, because many southern Chinese are also from northern Asia; Hakka or non-Hakka. It is known that the earliest major waves of Hakka migration began due to the attacks of the two afore-mentioned tribes during the Jin dynasty (265–420).|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{took issue}} with the level design and {{shooting}} mechanics, particularly when compared to both the original Duke Nukem 3D {{and those of other}} modern-day first-person shooters. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot felt that the [...] "joy of that game's shooting has been flattened" [...] with [...] "little sense of impact", finding the overall design to be [...] "tedious", and ended his video review by calling Duke Nukem Forever a [...] "bad, boring, bargain bin kind of game". Eurogamer commented that [...] "few of the locations [...] the sort of exploration and excitement that made Duke 3D such a memorable experience. Duke Nukem Forever is linear to a fault, and huge chunks of the game are spent simply walking from one fight to another through uninspired corridors." [...] IGN criticized [...] "the frequent first-person platforming segments that make up an unnecessarily large percentage of the story mode", although they stated the [...] "shooting sections are simple fun". GamesRadar concluded that [...] "Duke Nukem Forevers world-record development time has produced an ugly, buggy shooter that veers back and forth between enjoyably average and outright boring, with occasional surges of greatness along the way." [...] GamePro felt that [...] "Unexpected moments ... <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> game's biggest strengths. But they're few and far between." [...] X-Play gave the game a 1 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, load time, number of enemies onscreen, the multiplayer, being called [...] "an afterthought", the game's [...] "creepy, hateful view of women.", and the hive level, with Adam Sessler saying that [...] "this is all played for laughs".|$|E
