It participates regularly in Joint Chiefs of Staff and major command exercises, military operations other than war, and civic action programs. RED HORSE performs training projects that assist base construction efforts while, at the same time, honing wartime skills. Air Force RED HORSE units possess special capabilities, such as water-well drilling, explosive demolition, <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> <b>system</b> installation, quarry operations, concrete mobile operations, material testing, expedient facility erection, and concrete and asphalt paving.|$|E

2500|$|Eglin's east-west runway 12/30 {{was closed}} on 1 May 2015 to allow {{upgrading}} of <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> <b>systems</b> from obsolete BAK-9 systems to MB-100 textile brake systems. The BAK-9s {{were the last}} systems in operational USAF service. All flight operations used the north-south runway 1/19. The runway work was completed in August 2015. [...] "Closing Runway 12/30 may slightly increase noise over Valparaiso for a few months," [...] said Mark Pohlmeier, acting {{deputy assistant secretary of}} the Air Force for installations, in a news release. Further, 15 F-35Cs {{that are part of the}} Navy's backup aircraft inventory (BAI) are temporarily assigned at Eglin from May 2015 while construction upgrades are underway at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, their future base. That work is expected to be completed in about three years.|$|R

[...] The island is part of China's First Island Chain, which encompass the innermost ring of islands China considers essential for national defense. [...] Taiwan could then be used to protect mainland China and {{be used as a}} basing area to operate into the Second Island Chain. [...] China no longer actively seeks to invade Taiwan, but has a large force oriented toward it if the decision was ever to be made, or to be used for options short of war to intimidate or demonstrate strength, such as a blockade. [...] The Taiwanese military is made up of 290,000 personnel: 130,000 in the Army; 45,000 in the Navy and Marine Corps; and 80,000 in the Air Force. [...] Though the Army had previously been the dominant service, the shift to a defensive orientation has shifted importance to the Navy and Air Force to conduct most fighting away from population centers. [...] Given the current budgetary and numerical superiority of the Chinese military, Taiwan has moved towards an asymmetric anti-access/area denial system to imperil China's ability to operate in the Taiwan Strait rather than try to match its strength. [...] The RoCN, which was once the most neglected force, has become the most important to defeat an invasion fleet. [...] Combating the enemy fleet and sinking transport ships would take out large amounts of the ground invasion force and permanently degrade amphibious capabilities. [...] Surface ships primarily consist of guided missile destroyers and frigates, as well as four dozen small, fast missile boats to take out much larger Chinese surface and amphibious ships. [...] The RoCAF is optimized for air superiority and was once the more formidable of the two countries, but current Chinese technology investments have made China much more able to contest airspace. [...] Air bases are likely to come under attack from some 1,500 Chinese conventional ballistic missiles in range of the island, with about 50 direct hits needed to put each one out of action. [...] Taiwan has equipment to keep exposed bases operating while under fire with runway repair <b>systems</b> and mobile <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> <b>systems.</b> [...] There are two hardened air bases used by the RoCAF: Chiashan Air Base is in a hollowed-out mountain that can protect 100 fighters, and a second facility is buried in the outskirts of Taipei. [...] The RoCAF operates a nationwide air defense network to engage targets anywhere over the mainland; some anti-aircraft missile batteries are also located in underground silos. [...] The Army would only fight if Chinese forces manage to land and would engage in asymmetric warfare. [...] With all these measures, Taiwan Minister of National Defense Yen Ming believes that the country would be able to hold off a Chinese invasion for at least one month.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-As the {{car bomb}} {{incident}} becomes more prevalent globally, {{in order to}} protect people lives and avoid the complete destruction of the suspected vehicle, a promising solution is to use flexible vehicle <b>arresting</b> <b>systems,</b> which generally absorb the kinetic energy of the suspected vehicle using energy absorbers and an arresting net. So the vehicle can be arrested safely. According to the existing literature, theoretical research on vehicle <b>arresting</b> <b>system</b> and process is very little. This research is the first attempt at developing the analytical model for the <b>arresting</b> <b>system</b> and process, and carrying out experimental validation. Based on the model built, dynamic analysis of arresting process was also carried out. Experimental and simulated results indicate the model developed is valid and can accurately predict arresting distance.

50|$|A normal {{arrestment}} {{is accomplished}} when the arresting hook of an incoming aircraft engages {{one of the}} deck pendants. When a landing aircraft engages a deck pendant, {{the force of the}} forward motion of the landing aircraft is transferred to a purchase cable which is routed via sheaves to the arresting engine, located in a machinery room below the flight deck or {{on either side of the}} runway. As the deck pendant and the purchase cable are pulled out by the <b>aircraft</b> being <b>arrested,</b> the kinetic energy of the aircraft is transferred to mechanical energy of the cables, and the arresting engine transfers the mechanical energy of the cables to hydraulic energy. The arresting engine brings about a smooth, controlled stop of the landing aircraft. At the completion of the arrestment, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> hook is disengaged from the deck pendant, which is then retracted to its normal position.|$|R

Attempts {{have been made to}} make contrast agents bind to such ligands, with techniques such as dual-ligand targeting of distinct receptors to polymer microspheres, and biomimcry of the leukocyte’s selectin-integrin cell <b>arrest</b> <b>system,</b> having shown an increased adhesion efficiency, but yet not efficient enough to allow clinical use of targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound for inflammation.|$|R
