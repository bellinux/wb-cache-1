40|$|A {{wideband}} {{bow-tie antenna}} fed by wideband microstrip-coplanar stripline(CPS) balun and band notch structures {{that can be}} applied to bow-tie antenna are proposed in this paper. In order to increase bandwidth, bow-tie radiators are reshaped so that the surface current flows continuously, and wideband impedance matching is achieved by <b>adjusting</b> <b>strip</b> width and spacing of CPS feeding line. The VSWR is measured as 2 : 1 over the wide frequency range of 2. 3 ～ 12 GHz. The fabricated antenna size is 60 mm× 60 mm. In order to achieve the band-notch function at WLAN(5. 8 GHz), λ/ 4 folded-slits located λ/ 4 away from feeding point are utilized. To minimize the sli...|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} shape {{quality of the}} hot rolled strip, a pass {{schedule}} optimization has been developed for hot strip rolling using pair-cross (PC) mills. In this algorithm, a new flatness control criterion has been proposed, which involves the strip crown target in the classic flatness control criterion. Pass schedule is optimized to maximize the allowable control range of PC angles. Several case studies have been conducted. It {{has been found that}} the pass schedule optimization algorithm proposed by this research is very efficient. The final crown target can reach the designed crown target and the flatness can be maintained at a very small value. Through the pass schedule optimization, the PC angle control range has been enlarged. This provides operators more opportunities to <b>adjust</b> the <b>strip</b> flatness and crown...|$|R
50|$|The group's origins date to 1944 as the 3d Air Commando Group. The {{unit was}} {{assigned}} to Fifth Air Force in the Philippines in 1944 for operations with P-51 Mustangs, C-47 Skytrains, and L-5 Sentinel aircraft. It attacked Japanese airfields and installations in the Philippines, supported ground forces on Luzon, and provided escort for missions to Formosa and the China coast. It also made raids on airfields and railways on Formosa, and furnished cover for convoys. In addition, the group transported personnel, dropped supplies to ground troops and guerrilla forces, evacuated casualties from front-line <b>strips,</b> <b>adjusted</b> artillery fire, and flew courier and mail routes.|$|R
40|$|A new {{low-profile}} {{variable pitch}} angle cylindrical helical antenna employing a copper strip as impedance transformer is proposed in this paper. Under the circumstance {{of a limited}} antenna height, the circular polarization performance of the antenna has been enhanced by changing the pitch angle and the input impedance matching has been improved by <b>adjusting</b> the copper <b>strip</b> match stub. The design method of the proposed antenna is given. The optimal antenna structure for INMARSAT application has been fabricated and measured. The measured results show that in the whole maritime satellite communication work band the VSWR is less than 1. 2, its antenna gain is higher than 9 [*]dBi, and the axial ratio is lower than 2. 5 [*]dB. The experimental results have a good agreement with the simulations. The proposed antenna is compact and easy tuning. It provides a promising antenna element for maritime satellite communication applications...|$|R
40|$|LiDAR {{systems have}} been {{established}} as technology for fast and high-resolution acquisition of 3 D point clouds. In general, LiDAR data acquisition is conducted by private companies who are also responsible for processing and quality control. However, in many cases a subsequent quality assessment of overlapping LiDAR strips still reveals apparent horizontal and vertical offsets which are caused by undetected systematic errors (e. g. insufficient calibration and strip adjustment). The presented work covers methods {{for the detection of}} remaining discrepancies in overlapping LiDAR strips with main focus on {{the development of a new}} precise 3 D measurement technique based on intersecting roof ridge lines and roof planes which are automatically reconstructed from the LiDAR point clouds in overlapping strips. The coordinate differences between conjugate intersection points are incorporated in an adjustment process to resolve for the residual errors of each LiDAR strip separately. The new 3 D reconstruction method can also take advantage of full waveform measurements like pulse width and intensity which are decomposed from the waveforms. Finally, the LiDAR strips are corrected and validated by checking the correspondence among neighbouring strips. The quality control system has been successfully applied to pre-processed and <b>adjusted</b> LiDAR <b>strips.</b> In general, the results show that significant discrepancies mainly in position still exist. After the adjustment of 8 strips (altitude 1000 m) using precise 3 D measurements, the relative horizontal displacements between adjacent strips are improved by more than 70 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Searching in {{parallel}} {{is a technique}} {{that can be used}} in avalanche rescue scenarios where manpower and leadership are abundant and the number of buried victims is unknown. It is es-pecially applicable at ski resorts and by search-and-rescue teams. The technique involves using as many searchers as possible with the objective of narrowing each rescuer’s search strip width. The rescue leader <b>adjusts</b> the search <b>strip</b> width according to the size of the debris area and the number of available searchers. Each searcher commits to the coarse and fine search only after their distance reading is lower than their designated search strip width. This eliminates redundancy and ensures that each searcher locates a different victim. If more than one victim is buried, then these search <b>strips</b> can be <b>adjusted</b> by the rescue leader, if necessary, after each victim is pinpointed. Searching {{in parallel}} reduces the necessity of using complex multiple-burial search methods and technologies. It can be used to harness large pools of relatively unskilled searchers with only basic training in the technique. Searching in parallel is more feasible than in the past due to the simplicity of modern digital avalanche transceivers. It should be considered for use by rescue teams and in profes-sional avalanche courses, but only after the basics have been mastered, such as single-victim search-ing, probing, and shovelling...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how to manage grazing horses, {{including}} the thresholds under which energy supplementation is required. Here we investigated the effects of daily herbage allowance (DHA) and energy supplementation (ES) on daily herbage intake in lactating mares of light breeds grazing high-quality regrowth during summer. Three contrasting DHA, low (LOW), medium (MED), and high (HIGH), that is, 35. 0, 52. 5, and 70. 0 g DM∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d(- 1), respectively, were obtained by <b>adjusting</b> pasture <b>strip</b> width. Eighteen Anglo-Arab and French Saddle lactating mares were either supplemented with 2. 6 kg DM barley/d (SUP group; n= 9) or left nonsupplemented (NSUP group; n = 9) throughout the experiment. For 3 successive 2 -wk periods, 3 groups of SUP mares (n = 3) and 3 groups of NSUP mares (n = 3) grazed each DHA according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Pregrazing sward surface height (SSH) was similar between treatments (26. 6 cm), but postgrazing SSH differed significantly between each DHA (2. 9, 4. 4, and 5. 7 cm for LOW, MED, and HIGH, respectively; P < 0. 001). Herbage DMI (HDMI) increased linearly from 18. 5 to 23. 4 g DM∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d(- 1) with increasing DHA (i. e., 0. 13 kg DM eaten/kg DM of herbage offered; P < 0. 001) independently of ES and with no significant ES × DHA interaction. This increase in HDMI resulted from an increase in grazing time between LOW (961 min/d) and MED and HIGH (1, 021 min/d; P < 0. 01) and from an increase in intake rate between LOW and MED (11. 8 g DM/min) and HIGH (13. 6 g DM/min; P < 0. 01). Total digestible DMI (TDDMI) and NE intake (NEI) increased linearly from 12. 3 to 15. 2 g DM∙kg BW∙(- 1) d(- 1) and from 136. 6 to 165. 8 kJ∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d (- 1) with increasing DHA (P < 0. 001), respectively. Total digestible DMI and NEI were significantly lower for NSUP than for SUP mares: 12. 5 vs. 14. 9 g DM∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d(- 1) (P < 0. 01) and 134. 6 vs. 166. 5 kJ∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d(- 1) (P < 0. 001), respectively. Whereas SUP mares always met their energy requirements, NSUP mares no longer met theirs when DHA fell below 66 g DM∙kg BW(- 1) ∙d(- 1) (i. e., 39 kg DM∙mare(- 1) ∙d(- 1)) ...|$|R
30|$|The △ {{values of}} the triple-band MPA can be {{controlled}} through <b>adjusting</b> the Au <b>strip</b> lengths. Figure 4 e gives the absorption curves of the triple-band MPA in different cases of length l 1. As you can see, the l 1 change mainly affects the third mode frequency, while the frequency shifts {{of the first two}} modes are negligible, which are consistent with the theoretical prediction. Due to the frequency variation of the third mode, we can tune the △ value of the last two modes of the triple-band MPA. The △ {{values of the}} last two modes can be tuned from 12.66 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 33 [*]μm to 10.04 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 34 [*]μm, and 7.22 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 35 [*]μm. The △ value of the first two modes can also be controlled by adjusting length l 3 (see Fig.  4 g). The minimum discrete distance of the first two modes is 0.16  THz for l 3 [*]=[*] 38 [*]μm, and its △ value is 7.31 %. Furthermore, we can tune the △ values of the first two and last two modes via scaling the length l 2, i.e., the frequency of the second mode (see Fig.  4 f). Remarkably, the △ value changes of the first two and last two modes are mutual restriction because we only change the frequency of the second mode. For example, for l 1 [*]=[*] 37 [*]μm (see the blue line in Fig.  4 f), the discrete distance of the first two modes has the minimum value of 0.16  THz, while maximum value of 0.29  THz for last two modes can be obtained.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundMinimally {{invasive}} {{techniques such}} as endovenous laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy are widely used {{in the treatment of}} lower extremity varicosities. These therapies have not yet been compared with surgical ligation and stripping in large randomized clinical trials. MethodsA systematic review of Medline, Cochrane Library, and Cinahl was performed to identify studies on the effectiveness of the four therapies up to February 2007. All clinical studies (open, noncomparative, and randomized clinical trials) that used ultrasound examination as an outcome measure were included. Because observational and randomized clinical trial data were included, both the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Quality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) guidelines were consulted. A random effects meta-analysis was performed, and subgroup analysis and meta-regression were done to explore sources of between-study variation. ResultsOf the 119 retrieved studies, 64 (53. 8 %) were eligible and assessed 12, 320 limbs. Average follow-up was 32. 2 months. After 3 years, the estimated pooled success rates (with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]) for stripping, foam sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and laser therapy were about 78 % (70 %- 84 %), 77 % (69 %- 84 %), 84 % (75 %- 90 %), and 94 % (87 %- 98 %), respectively. After adjusting for follow-up, foam therapy and radiofrequency ablation were as effective as surgical <b>stripping</b> (<b>adjusted</b> odds ratio [AOR], 0. 12 [95 % CI, – 0. 61 to 0. 85] and 0. 43 [95 % CI, – 0. 19 to 1. 04], respectively). Endovenous laser therapy was significantly more effective compared with stripping (AOR, 1. 13; 95 % CI, 0. 40 - 1. 87), foam therapy (AOR, 1. 02; 95 % CI, 0. 28 - 1. 75), and radiofrequency ablation (AOR, 0. 71; 95 % CI, 0. 15 - 1. 27). ConclusionIn the absence of large, comparative randomized clinical trials, the minimally invasive techniques appear to be at least as effective as surgery in the treatment of lower extremity varicose veins...|$|R
