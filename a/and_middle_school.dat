5|$|Hinde {{attended}} elementary <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>school</b> in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town {{his father}} founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A {{portion of the}} family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and}} a half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>school</b> classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also {{enters the}} academy {{much to her}} surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, {{and it has been}} suggested that he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
