5000|$|<b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AB-III-56, HU-239, IP-751, CPL 7075, CT-3, Resunab) is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid derivative of the non-psychoactive THC metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC that shows useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects without causing a subjective [...] "high". It {{is being developed}} {{for the treatment of}} neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. It does not however share the anti-emetic effects of other cannabinoids but may be useful for treating pain and chronic inflammatory conditions where nausea is not present. Side effects include dry mouth, tiredness and dizziness. The mechanism of action has not yet been fully established, but <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> may activate the CB2 receptor in the periphery leading to production of resolving eicosanoids. Studies in animals at doses up to 40 mg/kg show minimal psychoactivity of <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid,</b> comparable to that produced by tetrahydrocannabinol,. Likewise, {{there was no difference between}} <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> and placebo on the [...] "cannabimimetic" [...] assay when used in humans at therapeutic doses. [...] A new highly purified composition of <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> named Anabasum (formerly Resunab) is being developed by Corbus Pharmaceuticals (formerly JB Therapeutics)for the treatment of orphan life-threatening inflammatory diseases.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AjA), a {{synthetic}} nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, and lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4), an eicosanoid formed from sequential actions of 5 - and 15 -lipoxygenases (LOX), facilitate resolution of inflammation. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether the ability of AjA to limit the progress of inflammation might relate to an increase in LXA 4, a known anti-inflammatory and proresolving mediator. Addition of AjA (0 – 30 μM) in vitro to human blood and synovial cells increased production of LXA 4 (ELISA) 2 - to 5 -fold. Administration of AjA to mice with peritonitis resulted in a 25 – 75 % reduction of cells invading the peritoneum, and a 7 -fold increase in LXA 4 identified by mass spectrometry. Blockade of 12 / 15 LOX, which leads to LXA 4 synthesis via 15 -HETE production, reduced (> 90 %) the ability of AjA to enhance production of LXA 4 in vitro. These results suggest that AjA and other agents that increase endogenous compounds that facilitate resolution of inflammation may be useful for conditions characterized by inflammation and tissue injury. —Zurier, R.

40|$|This review covers reports {{published}} in the last 5  years on the anti-inflammatory activities of all classes of cannabinoids, including phytocannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, synthetic analogs such as <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> and nabilone, the endogenous cannabinoids anandamide and related compounds, namely, the elmiric acids, and finally, noncannabinoid components of Cannabis that show anti-inflammatory action. It {{is intended to be}} an update on the topic of the involvement of cannabinoids in the process of inflammation. A possible mechanism for these actions is suggested involving increased production of eicosanoids that promote the resolution of inflammation.

40|$|The Cannabis {{plant and}} its {{products}} consist {{of an enormous}} variety of chemicals. Some of the 483 compounds identified are unique to Cannabis, for example, the more than 60 cannabinoids, whereas the terpenes, with about 140 members forming the most abundant class, are widespread in the plant kingdom. The term “cannabinoids” [note: “ ” represents a group of C 21 terpenophenolic compounds found until now uniquely in Cannabis sativa L. (1).

40|$|<b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (CT- 3, IP- 751, 1 ’, 1 ’-dimethylheptyl-Δ 8 acid) (AJA) has a cannabinoid-derived structure; however, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that it produces psychotropic actions when given at therapeutic doses. In a variety of animal assays, AJA shows efficacy in models for pain and inflammation. Furthermore, in the rat adjuvant arthritis model, it displayed a remarkable action in preventing the destruction of inflamed joints. A phase- 2 human trial with chronic, neuropathic pain patients suggested that AJA could become a useful drug for treating this condition. Its low toxicity, particularly its lack of ulcerogenicity, further suggests that it will have a highly favorable therapeutic index and may replace some of the current anti-inflammatory/analgesic medications.

40|$|The primary {{underlying}} {{issue that}} Dr. Burstein raises in his comment [4] on the Vann et al. manuscript [7] {{is one of}} predictive validity; i. e., {{the extent to which}} preclinical findings can be used to predict clinical effi-cacy and/or side effects of a novel drug in humans. This issue has bedeviled preclinical research since initiation of the use of results from this type of research in the process of drug development.

40|$|SUMMARY. This study reviews human {{clinical}} experience to date with several synthetic cannabinoids, including nabilone, levonantradol, <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (CT 3), dexanabinol (HU- 211), HU- 308, and SR 141716 (Rimonabant®). Additionally, {{the concept of}} “clinical endogenous cannabinoid defi-ciency ” is explored as a possible factor in migraine, idiopathic bowel dis-ease, fibromyalgia and other clinical pain states. The concept of analgesic synergy of cannabinoids and opioids is addressed. A cannabinoid-medi-ated improvement in night vision at the retinal level is discussed, {{as well as its}} potential application to treatment of retinitis pigmentosa and other conditions. Additionally noted is the role of cannabinoid treatment in neuroprotection and its application to closed head injury, cerebrovas-cular accidents, and CNS degenerative diseases including Alzheimer, Huntington, Parkinson diseases and ALS.

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AjA), a synthetic nonpsychoactive cannabinoid acid, prevents joint cartilage and bone damage in an experimental model of arthritis in rats. Joint tissue injury {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is due in part}} to activation of T lymphocytes in the synovium, and T lymphocytes in synovium of RA patients are resistant to apoptosis. Thus, a potential mechanism whereby AjA prevents joint tissue injury in the animal model might be enhanced apoptosis of T lymphocytes. Apoptosis of human T cells in vitro was assessed by Annexin V expression, caspase- 3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and microscopy. AjA induced apoptosis of T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis preceded loss of cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion, confirming that cell loss was due to programmed cell death rather than necrosis. A nontoxic compound such as AjA may be a useful therapeutic agent for patients with diseases such as RA which are characterized by T-cell-driven chronic inflammation and tissue injury...|$|E

When using two calibration graphs, the assay linearity ranged from 10 to 750 ng/ml, and 750 to 3000 ng/ml AJA. The intra- and inter-day precision (R. S.

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AjA), a cannabinoid acid devoid of psychoactivity, prevents joint tissue injury in rats with adjuvant induced arthritis. Because activation of osteoclasts {{is central to}} the pathogenesis of bone erosion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated the influence of AjA on osteoclast differentiation and survival. Osteoclast cultures were established by stimulation of RAW 264. 7 cells and primary mouse bone marrow cultures with receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Simultaneous addition of AjA (15 and 30 microM) and RANKL to both culture systems significantly suppressed development of multinucleated osteoclasts (osteoclastogenesis) in a dose dependent manner, as determined by quantification of multinuclear, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive cells. AjA impaired growth of RAW 264. 7 monocytes and prevented further osteoclast formation in cultures in which osteoclastogenesis had already begun. Reduction by AjA of both monocyte growth and osteoclast formation was associated with apoptosis, assayed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining, and caspase activity. The anti-osteoclastogenic effects of AjA did not require the continuous presence of AjA in the cell cultures. Based on these findings, we propose that AjA or other nonpsychoactive synthetic analogs of Cannabis constituents may be useful therapy for diseases such as RA and osteoporosis in which bone resorption is a central feature...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AJA) is a {{synthetic}} analog of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolite THC- 11 -oic acid; THC {{is a major}} active ingredient of the drug marijuana derived from the plant cannabis. AJA has potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity without the psychotropic action of THC. Unlike the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, AJA is not ulcerogenic at therapeutic doses, making it a promising anti-inflammatory drug. However, the mechanism of AJA action remains unknown. Here we report that AJA binds directly and specifically to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a pharmacologically important member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Functional assay indicates that AJA activates the transcriptional activity of both human and mouse PPARgamma at pharmacological concentrations. Activation of PPARgamma by AJA requires the AF- 2 helix of the receptor, suggesting that AJA activates PPARgamma through the ligand-dependent AF- 2 function. AJA binding consistently enables PPARgamma to recruit nuclear receptor coactivators. In addition, we show that AJA inhibits interleukin- 8 promoter activity in a PPARgamma-dependent manner, suggesting {{a link between the}} anti-inflammatory action of AJA and the activation of PPARgamma. Finally, we find that AJA treatment induces differentiation of 3 T 3 L 1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, a process mediated by PPARgamma. Together, these data indicate that PPARgamma may be a molecular target for AJA, providing a potential mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of AJA, and possibly other cannabinoids. These studies also implicate other potential therapeutic actions of AJA through PPARgamma activation in multiple signaling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Background Cannabinoids {{modulate}} fibrogenesis in scleroderma. <b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AjA) is a non-psychoactive synthetic analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol {{that can}} bind the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). Recent evidence suggests {{a key role}} for PPAR-γ in fibrogenesis. Objective To determine whether AjA can modulate fibrogenesis in murine models of scleroderma. Material and methods Bleomycin-induced experimental fibrosis {{was used to assess}} the antifibrotic effects of AjA in vivo. In addition, the efficacy of AjA in pre-established fibrosis was analysed in a modified model of bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis and in mice overexpressing a constitutively active transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor I. Skin fibrosis was evaluated by quantification of skin thickness and hydroxyproline content. As a marker of fibroblast activation, α-smooth muscle actin was examined. To study the direct effect of AjA in collagen neosynthesis, skin fibroblasts from patients with scleroderma were treated with increasing concentrations of AjA. Protein expression of PPAR-γ, and its endogenous ligand 15 d-PGJ 2, and TGFβ were assessed before and after AjA treatment. Results AjA significantly prevented experimental bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis and modestly reduced its progression when started 3 weeks into the disease. AjA strongly reduced collagen neosynthesis by scleroderma fibroblasts in vitro, an action which was reversed completely by co-treatment with a selective PPAR-γ antagonist. Conclusions AjA prevents progression of fibrosis in vivo and inhibits fibrogenesis in vitro by stimulating PPAR-γ signalling. Since therapeutic doses of AjA are well tolerated in humans, it is suggested that AjA as an interesting molecule targeting fibrosis in patients with scleroderma...|$|E
40|$|Cannabinoids act at two {{classical}} cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 and CB 2), a 7 TM {{orphan receptor}} and the transmitter-gated channel transient receptor potential vanilloid type- 1 receptor. Recent evidence {{also points to}} cannabinoids acting at members of the nuclear receptor family, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, with three subtypes α, β (δ) and γ), which regulate cell differentiation and lipid metabolism. Much evidence now suggests that endocannabinoids are natural activators of PPARα. Oleoylethanolamide regulates feeding and body weight, stimulates fat utilization and has neuroprotective effects mediated through activation of PPARα. Similarly, palmitoylethanolamide regulates feeding and lipid metabolism and has anti-inflammatory properties mediated by PPARα. Other endocannabinoids that activate PPARα include anandamide, virodhamine and noladin. Some (but not all) endocannabinoids also activate PPARγ; anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol have anti-inflammatory properties mediated by PPARγ. Similarly, <b>ajulemic</b> <b>acid,</b> a structural analogue of a metabolite of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes anti-inflammatory effects in vivo through PPARγ. THC also activates PPARγ, leading to a time-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated arteries. Other cannabinoids which activate PPARγ include N-arachidonoyl-dopamine, HU 210, WIN 55212 - 2 and CP 55940. In contrast, {{little research has been}} carried out on the effects of cannabinoids at PPARδ. In this newly emerging area, a number of research questions remain unanswered; for example, why do cannabinoids activate some isoforms and not others? How much of the chronic effects of cannabinoids are through activation of nuclear receptors? And importantly, do cannabinoids confer the same neuro- and cardioprotective benefits as other PPARα and PPARγ agonists? This review will summarize the published literature implicating cannabinoid-mediated PPAR effects and discuss the implications thereof...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Ajulemic</b> <b>acid</b> (AjA) is a {{synthetic}} analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol that can prevent and limit progression of skin fibrosis in experimental systemic sclerosis. In {{this study we}} investigated whether AjA also prevents and modulates lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM) when administered in mice during the inflammatory or the fibrogenic phase of the model. Methods: The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic efficacy of AjA was evaluated in DBA/ 2 mice treated orally once a day starting either at day 0 (preventive treatment) or at day 8 (therapeutic treatment) after a single intratracheal instillation of BLM. AjA was given at a dose of 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed at day 8, 14 and 21 after BLM and lungs were processed for histology and morphometry, and examined for HO-proline content and {{for the expression of}} transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1), phosphorylated Smad 2 / 3 (pSMAD 2 / 3), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ). Results: In the 1 st week after BLM challenge, an acute inflammation characterized by neutrophil and macrophage accumulation was the main change present in lung parenchyma. The "switch" between inflammation and fibrosis occurs between day 8 and 14 after BLM instillation and involves the bronchi and vasculature. In the subsequent week (at day 21 after BLM instillation) bronchiolocentric fibrosis with significant increase of tissue collagen develops. The fibrotic response evaluated by morphometry and quantified as HO-proline in lung tissue at day 21 after BLM treatment was significantly reduced in mice receiving either AjA in the inflammatory or in early fibrogenic phase. AjA induces marked change in the expression pattern of products implicated in fibrogenesis, such as TGF-β 1, pSMAD 2 / 3, CTGF and α-SMA. In addition, AjA increases significantly the number of PPAR-γ positive cells and its nuclear localization. Conclusions: AjA treatment, starting either at day 0 or at day 8 after BLM challenge, counteracts the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effectiveness of AjA is irrespective of timing of compound administration. Further clinical studies are necessary to establish whether AjA may represent a new therapeutic option for treating fibrotic lung diseases...|$|E
