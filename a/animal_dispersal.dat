60|$|General {{features}} of Overlapping and Discontinuous Areas.--These numerous examples of discontinuous genera and families form an important {{section of the}} facts of <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> which any true theory must satisfactorily account for. In greater or less prominence {{they are to be}} found all over the world, and in every group of animals, and they grade imperceptibly into those cases of conterminous and overlapping areas which we have seen to {29} prevail in most extensive groups of species, and which are perhaps even more common in those large families which consist of many closely allied genera. A sufficient proof of the overlapping of generic areas is the occurrence of a number of genera of the same family together. Thus in France or Italy about twenty genera of warblers (Sylviadæ) are found, and as each of the thirty-three genera of this family inhabiting temperate Europe and Asia has a different area, a great number must here overlap. So, in most parts of Africa, at least ten or twelve genera of antelopes may be found, and in South America {{a large proportion of the}} genera of monkeys of the family Cebidæ occur in many districts; and still more is this the case with the larger bird families, such as the tanagers, the tyrant shrikes, or the tree-creepers, so that there is in all these extensive families no genus whose area does not overlap that of many others. Then among the moderately extensive families we find a few instances of one or two genera isolated from the rest, as the spectacled bear, Tremarctos, found only in Chili, while the remainder of the family extends from Europe and Asia over North America to the Mountains of Mexico, but no further south; the Bovidæ, or hollow-horned ruminants, which have a few isolated genera in the Rocky Mountains and the islands of Sumatra and Celebes; and from these we pass on to the cases of wide separation already given.|$|E

Seed {{dispersal}} is less obvious: they are evidently not wind dispersed and the woody, non-spiny fruits do not readily suggest <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> either; however we do know that people now disperse and cultivate the seeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruits of}} all species must be wind {{dispersed}} because {{members of the}} genus are trees and are thus too tall for animals (presumably mammals) to brush against on the ground. However, the elaboration of spines on the fruits of many taxa would argue for <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> although wind dispersal undoubtedly predominates in P. australis. Numerous birds forage or live in Polylepis trees {{and it is possible}} that they disperse fruits caught in their feathers.|$|E

50|$|After a disturbance, {{there are}} several ways in which {{regeneration}} can occur. One way, termed the advance regeneration pathway, is when the primary understory already contains seedlings and saplings. This method is most common in the Neotropics when faced when small scale disturbances. The next pathway is from tree remains, or any growth from bases or roots, and is common in small disturbance gaps. The third route {{is referred to as the}} soil seed bank, and is the result of germination of seeds already found in the soil. The final regeneration pathway is the arrival of new seeds via <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> or wind movement. The most critical components of the regeneration are seed distribution, germination, and survival.|$|E
5000|$|The woody {{nature of}} {{associated}} stalks and preserved short shoots are evidence that Caytoniales were seasonally deciduous, shrubs and trees. Caytoniales had fertile branches with seed-bearing cupules [...] The ovules were located inside fleshy cupules with tough outer cuticle. Individual ovules had an apical tube called a micropylar canal, that allowed pollen to {{pass into the}} pollen chamber. The outer layers of the cupules were fleshy and fruit-like; it is possible this was to aid in <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal.</b> The cupules are 4-5mm in diameter and about 3 mm long (Fig 1-2), and resemble a blueberry. The extra protection of the reproductive organs {{gave rise to the}} idea that Caytoniales were predecessors to angiosperms, which have completely enclosed seeds.|$|E
50|$|The female cones {{are large}} and usually woody, 2 - 60 cm long, with {{numerous}} spirally arranged scales, and two winged seeds on each scale. The male cones are small, 0.5 - 6.0 cm long, and fall soon after pollination; pollen dispersal is by wind. Seed dispersal is mostly by wind, but some species have large seeds with reduced wings, and are dispersed by birds. Analysis of Pinaceae cones reveals how selective pressure has shaped the evolution of variable cone size and function throughout the family. Variation in cone size in the family has likely resulted from the variation of seed dispersal mechanisms available in their environments over time. All Pinaceae with seeds weighing less than 90 mg are seemingly adapted for wind dispersal. Pines having seeds larger than 100 mg {{are more likely to}} have benefited from adaptations that promote <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal,</b> particularly by birds. Pinaceae that persist in areas where tree squirrels are abundant do not seem to have evolved adaptations for bird dispersal.|$|E
40|$|The {{entry of}} {{a high number of}} large animals from Africa, North America and Asia into Europe during the Plio‐Pleistocene {{provided}} a rich diversity of both herbivore and carnivore populations. These high numbers of <b>animal</b> <b>dispersals</b> into Europe indicate that the continent was a sink habitat during the Plio‐Pleistocene and probably open to way of hominid entry into the continent. Studying of these dispersals is important for understanding the late Neogene and the Quaternary environment of Europe, particularly the timing of the establishment and collapsing of the land bridges as well as developments in climate and vegetation. Moreover, a high number of long distance <b>animal</b> <b>dispersals</b> also give to opportunity of a studying the animal dispersals’ behaviors and modes which represent the occurrence of a dispersal in ‘space’, ‘time’ and ‘form’. The Plio‐Pleistocene long distance <b>dispersals</b> of <b>animals</b> into Europe reveal four distinct movement patterns as ‘geodispersal,’ ‘secular migration’, ‘diffusion’ and ‘jump dispersal’. At the same time, variation in the <b>dispersal</b> behaviors of <b>animals</b> as ‘migration’ and ‘immigration’ were observed in which, the duration of species were much longer by ‘immigration’ between the Late Pliocene and Cromerian, however, after the establishment of the 100 kyr climate cyclicity, the ‘migration’ behavior of herbivores were the dominant pattern which reveal short term duration and repeated back and forward movements of the species into the continent...|$|R
50|$|Wind and <b>animals</b> <b>dispersals</b> are {{two major}} {{mechanisms}} involved in the dispersal of conifer seeds. Wind bore seed dispersal involves two processes, namely; local neighborhood dispersal (LND) and long- distance dispersal (LDD). Long-distance dispersal distances ranges from 11.9 - 33.7 km from the source.The bird family, Corvidae is the primary distributor of the conifer seeds. These birds are known to cache 32,000 pine seeds and transport the seeds as far as 12 - 22 km from the source. The birds store the seeds in the soil at depths of 2 - 3 cm under conditions which favor germination.|$|R

5000|$|Seed {{dispersal}} in treefall gaps {{is significantly}} reduced compared to normal understory areas. One study suggested {{that within the}} first three years after the gaps formed, the seed dispersal rate was 72% lower than the rates in nearby understory. Most forms of dispersal, such as wind and <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal,</b> show a {{reduction in the number of}} seeds dispersed. [...] However, explosive dispersion shows an increase [...] Explosive dispersion describes a mechanism by which the parent plant ejects its seeds using pressure, ensuring that they land far from the parent plant. This type of dispersal is used in several shrub species. The increase shows that treefall gaps have a positive effect on the seed dispersal of shrubs. These shrubs either survived the creation of the gap or migrated in soon after it was created. Due to their unique method of dispersal, these plants have an advantage when colonizing the gap. As the treefall gap ages and the canopy layer begins to return to normal, other forms of seed dispersal begin to increase in frequency, eventually returning to their pre-gap values years after its formation.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} within the park to assess the factors influencing forest regeneration and forest management techniques. One such study’s results suggested that forest restoration could be achieved through preventing fires within the park and allowing natural succession to occur so that the grasslands formed due to human activity could naturally regenerate to forests. The results showed that plots within the park that had the longest history of fire exclusion had the highest species diversity of trees. Furthermore, species of trees that required <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> of their seeds were far more abundant than non-animal dispersed species in the plot with the longest duration of fire exclusion. This suggests that seed dispersing animals were also more abundant in areas where fire was excluded. Lastly, the presence of seed dispersers and animal dispersed species of trees in some grassland plots suggest that suppressing fire and allowing natural seed dispersal to occur can encourage forest regeneration. Another study evaluated the use of exotic pine and cypress tree plantations as a forest restoration technique within the park. This study showed a high level of natural regeneration of indigenous trees within pine plantations most likely due to the use of these plantations by seed dispersing animals such as redtail monkeys, chimpanzees, duikers, and bushpigs, all of which were sited or tracked within the plantations.|$|E
50|$|The best studied {{interaction}} between animals and Persoonia species is {{that between the}} plants and their pollinators. All species that have been studied in detail {{have been found to}} be pollinated by a variety of native bees, but especially species of Leioproctus subgenus Cladocerapis (Colletidae), which rarely visit any plants but Persoonia. The behaviour of these bees on Persoonia flowers is quite predictable. Both males and females alight on the cross-shaped “platform” formed by the recurved anther tips, orient themselves to be facing one of the anther/tepals, then slide, face first, down between the anther and the style to reach the two glands at either side of the base of the tepal, and drink the nectar from them. Females gather pollen grains with their legs while drinking nectar. The insect then withdraws to the top of the flower, makes a 180° turn, then repeats the process on the other side of the flower. Another species group in Leioproctus, subgenus Filiglossa, also specialises in feeding on Persoonia flowers but these smaller bees seem to be nectar and pollen “thieves”, not effective pollinators. The introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also a frequent visitor of Persoonia flowers at most sites but it is still unclear whether this species is an effective pollinator.The fleshy fruits of Persoonia species are clearly adapted for <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> but it is still unclear whether mammals such as possums and wallabies, or large flying birds such as currawongs are the most important dispersers. Parrots, also feed on Persoonia fruits, but the fruit (and seed) they eat are unripe, and hence their interaction with the plants is predatory rather than symbiotic.|$|E

Within this range {{of thousands of}} miles across hundreds of islands are large variations in size, pattern, and scalation. The monitors have also been introduced to Japan since the 1940s. Like the introduction to Japan, some herpetologists believe this <b>animal's</b> <b>dispersal</b> from the East Indies to smaller Pacific islands was facilitated by Polynesians to provide a meat supply. However, other scientists maintain this is not likely, as the monitors would compete with man for food, grow slowly, and yield little meat.|$|R

50|$|Microbial biogeographic {{patterns}} are often {{similar to those}} of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the distance decay relationship, the abundance-range relationship, and Rapoport's rule. This is surprising given the many disparities between microorganisms and macro-organisms, in particular their size (micrometers vs. meters), time between generations (minutes vs. years), and dispersibility (global vs. local). However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, dispersal, selection, and mutation). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the atmosphere (for larger <b>animals</b> <b>dispersal</b> is much more constrained due to their size). As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.|$|R

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> in a {{fragmented}} landscape {{depends on the}} complex interaction between landscape structure and animal behavior. To better understand how individuals disperse, {{it is important to}} explicitly represent the properties of organisms and the landscape in which they move. A common approach to modelling dispersal includes representing the landscape as a grid of equal sized cells and then simulating individual movement as a correlated random walk. This approach uses a priori scale of resolution, which limits the representation of all landscape features and how different dispersal abilities are modelled. We develop a vector-based landscape model coupled with an object-oriented model for <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal.</b> In this spatially explicit dispersal model, landscape features are defined based on their geographic and thematic properties and dispersal is modelled through consideration of an organism 2 ̆ 7 s behavior, movement rules and searching strategies (such as visual cues).

40|$|Dispersal is a {{critically}} important process in ecology, but robust predictive models of <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> remain elusive. We identify a potentially ubiquitous component {{of variation in}} <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> that has been largely overlooked until now: the influence of mate encounters on settlement probability. We use an individual-based model to simulate dispersal in sexually-reproducing organisms that follow a simple set of movement rules based on conspecific encounters, within an environment lacking spatial habitat heterogeneity. We show that dispersal distances vary dramatically with fluctuations in population density in such a model, {{even in the absence}} of variation in dispersive traits between individuals. In a simple random-walk model with promiscuous mating, dispersal distributions become increasingly ‘fat-tailed ’ at low population densities due to the increasing scarcity of mates. Similar variation arises in models incorporating territoriality. In a model with polygynous mating, we show that patterns of sex-biased dispersal can even be reversed across a gradient of population density, despite underlying dispersal mechanisms remaining unchanged. We show that some widespread dispersal patterns found in nature (e. g. fat tailed distributions) can arise as a result of demographic variability in the absence of heterogeneity in dispersive traits across the population. This implies that models in which individual dispersal distances are considered to be fixed traits might be unrealistic, as dispersal distances vary widely under a single dispersal mechanism when settlement is influenced by mate encounters. Mechanistic models offer a promising means of advancing our understanding of dispersal in sexually...|$|E

40|$|The {{recruitment}} {{patterns of}} trees, shrubs and climbers were studied in two contrasting geographical areas in Venezuela: the Venezuelan Central Plain (VCP), and shrubland. The main {{purpose was to}} determine whether recruitment was simultaneously affected by adult plant abundance and relative fecundity in two different geographical areas, and if such relationships were influenced by life forms, vegetation types, dispersal syndromes, and within and between habitats in the VCP. Multiple regressions were used to determine the effect of adult plant abundance and relative fecundity on seedling and juvenile plant abundance. The relative abundance of juvenile plants increased significantly with the simultaneous increment of relative adult abundance and relative fecundity. However, the best predictor of plant recruitment was adult plant abundance. The effect of adult abundance and the fecundity of life forms on recruitment varied according to habitat in the VCP. Significant regressions were also found for species with animal dispersed plant species in the VCP and animal and wind dispersed species in the shrubland. This agrees with the associations between shrubs with <b>animals</b> <b>dispersal</b> in the VCP. Although plants tended to recruit mainly in those habitats where the parent plants were found, recruitment also depended upon the fecundity and adult abundance of plants from different habitats.

40|$|The Ice Free Corridor {{has been}} invoked as a route for Pleistocene human and <b>animal</b> <b>dispersals</b> between eastern Beringia and more southerly areas of North America. Despite the {{significance}} of the corridor, there are limited data for when and how this corridor was used. Hypothetical uses of the corridor include: the first expansion of humans from Beringia into the Americas, northward postglacial expansions of fluted point technologies into Beringia, and continued use of the corridor as a contact route between the north and south. Here, we use radiocarbon dates and ancient mitochondrial DNA from late Pleistocene bison fossils to determine the chronology for when the corridor was open and viable for biotic dispersals. The corridor was closed after ∼ 23, 000 until 13, 400 calendar years ago (cal y BP), after which we find the first evidence, to our knowledge, that bison used this route to disperse from the south, and by 13, 000 y from the north. Our chronology supports a habitable and traversable corridor by at least 13, 000 cal y BP, just before the first appearance of Clovis technology in interior North America, and indicates that the corridor would not have been available for significantly earlier southward human dispersal. Following the opening of the corridor, multiple dispersals of human groups between Beringia and interior North America may have continued throughout the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. Our results highlight the utility of phylogeographic analyses to test hypotheses about paleoecological history and the viability of dispersal routes over time...|$|R
40|$|In human-dominated landscapes, {{populations and}} species extinctions are {{directly}} related to habitat destruction and fragmentation. To provide genetic diversity as well as population viability, individual exchanges among isolated populations must be maintained. Therefore, <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> processes in fragmented landscape become an important topic for ecologists, and ecological networks planning {{has become one of the}} major challenges for landscape planners. Identification of habitat patches as well as assessment of the effect of ecological networks is badly needed. Since little information on the effect of landscape heterogeneities on <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> is available, simulation models are being developed. As dispersal pattern and success strongly depend on the spatial context, species' interactions with landscapes, species behaviour and species ability to disperse, these models must be able to simulate them explicitly. This research work therefore aims first at developing methods and models that allow realistic <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> simulations in fragmented landscapes. Second it aims at evaluating the effect of landscape heterogeneities and animal behaviour on dispersal and on species persistence. Additionally, the ability of such a model to estimate gene flow is analysed. To carry on this research, the following fields have been explored: landscape ecology, metapopulation dynamic, animal behaviour, genetics, Geographical Information Systems, modelling approaches and programming. A method, based on properties provided by Geographical Information Systems software, is first proposed to generate ecological networks by simulating <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> according to animal movement constraints induced by human infrastructures. The resulting maps provide a spatial identification of ecological networks, corridors and conflicting areas. This model has proved to be a useful and straightforward tool for landscape planning, even if this model, similar to other present-day models used in dispersal simulations, presents numerous technical and scientific limitations. To improve models for <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal,</b> a feature-oriented landscape model associated with an expert system has been developed. Its conceptualisation, its formalism, its data structure and its object-oriented design implementation provide a very accurate representation of landscape features and simulation of complex interactions between model entities (individuals and landscape features) based on simple rules. It allows the spatial identification of simulated processes. The ability of this model to incorporate states, relations and transition rules between entities makes it applicable to simulate large ranges of dispersal processes according to specific behaviour and/or landscape uses. To analyse the influence of landscape heterogeneities and species behaviour on dispersal and their incidence on metapopulation dynamics, the proposed feature-oriented model has been coupled with an animal model. The latter assigns different cognitive and dispersal abilities to individuals. Based on simulations according to three movement strategies (corresponding to the cognitive abilities of the simulated species), two measures evaluate the effect of cognitive abilities on dispersal: the colonisation probability between habitat patches and the ecological distance (due to landscape heterogeneities). These measures give an estimation of metapopulation structures (the habitat patches belonging to the metapopulation) and metapopulation dynamics induced by the landscape heterogeneities (for example, the habitat patches which release individuals). The complexity of dispersal processes, considering species behaviours and dispersal abilities, can therefore be reproduced and analysed at different levels. This application has shown the importance of animal behaviour on metapopulation dynamics and structure. Since tracking animals and providing sufficient data remain difficult, calibration and validation procedures of dispersal models are difficult to perform. One approach proposed here is to measure one of the consequences of dispersal: genetic differentiation among populations. Geographical distances are in general used to explain a part of the genetic differentiations. But as our fundamental assumption states that landscape heterogeneities and spatial arrangements of landscape features may strongly affect dispersal successes, genetic distance between populations must be better explained by the estimate of a model which considers these factors. We have tested this assumption with the greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula). Scenarios considering various behaviours and dispersal abilities of C. russula have been performed. Relating measures of genetic, geographical and ecological distances (the latter emerge from scenario simulation results) highlights the model capability to reproduce dispersal of C. russula by explaining a greater part of the genetic differentiation than that explained by the geographical distances. This application has not only pointed out the ability of the model to quantify connectivity between habitat patches but also the difficulty to relate gene dispersal and individual dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Dispersal is a {{key process}} in ecology, {{evolutionary}} and conservation biology. Studies like mark-release-recapture work, show patterns of movement, but do not {{provide insight into the}} behavioural. mechanisms. We review and comment recent results on <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> behaviour. Dispersal. through a landscape can be realised in two different ways: as a by-product of routine movements associated with resource exploitation (like foraging or mate-searching) with high levels of returning, or, as special., fast and directed movements designed for displacement. We illustrate and discuss both classes of movements as behaviourally different types. These types of movement imply different assumptions and consequences. We point at potential. biases of current studies (like mark-release-recapture studies) towards routine, explorative movements. A more accurate knowledge of the dispersal behaviour is important to model dispersal with more biological realism, but also to better understand evolutionary consequences (e. g. uncoupled evolution of routine and special movements) and conservation (e. g. relative importance of corridors). The contribution of routine movements to dispersal is expected to decline with habitat fragmentation. A species' mobility is not a static trait, but a multiple trait, the components of which may evolve rapidly. The possibility of uncoupled selection on routine movements and real dispersal movements remains to be evaluated. Yet, we are only at the beginning of understanding the behavioural ecology of dispersal movements.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{distribution}} of reproductive traits in woody vegetation of 10 wet tropical forests in northeastern Costa Rica. Based on quantitative sampling of seedlings, saplings, and trees, we assess whether particular sexual systems, pollination syndromes, or seed-dispersal modes are associated with successional stage, prior selective logging, woody growth forms, or patterns of abundance or rarity. We further examine the phylogenetic structure of these traits in the regional woody flora, testing explicit hypotheses regarding phylogenetic clustering of reproductive traits and habitat distributions. <b>Animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> and insect pollination predominate across all forest types and size classes. In second-growth trees, relative abundance of species with explosive dispersal, hermaphroditic flowers, and insect pollination is higher, and relative abundance of species with <b>animal</b> <b>dispersal</b> and mammal pollination is lower, compared to old-growth and logged forests. Overall, dioecy and wind dispersal are more frequent than expected in canopy trees, and hermaphroditic flowers are more frequent than expected in shrubs.

Patterns of trait distribution across forest types are closely linked with patterns of floristic composition at the genus and family level.
