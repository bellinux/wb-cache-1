40|$|The {{development}} of feedforward semi-empirical control models for furnaces and {{the evaluation of}} mass balances are based on plant data. The models can only {{be as good as}} the data and it is therefore required to know the inherent uncertainty associated with the plant data.

The impact of this assumption is significant, as a reasonably homogeneous melt could be represented by one sample only.

Recent {{research has focused on}} introducing new <b>alloying</b> systems, different <b>furnace</b> atmospheres and combining sintering and post sintering processes for more hardenable powder metallurgy (PM) steels. By elimination of any secondary operation such as quench-hardening and instead by introducing the hardening treatment right after sintering, fabrication cost is reduced by far. Sinter-hardening is a result of research conducted along this line. In this process, it is possible to manufacture sintered parts with a martensitic-bainitic microstructure by applying sufficient cooling rates (1 - 10 °C/s depending on composition) directly after sintering. In addition, alloying elements such as Cr, Mo and Mn are usually added to the Fe-based powder to enhance the hardenability of the material. In this thesis, the cooling response of prealloyed steel powder during the sinter-hardening process has been investigated by means of Finite Element Method (FEM).

AFReCC materials will have various applications in advanced high-efficiency and high-performance engines: that is, the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), space propulsion components, and land-based systems. For example, silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites show promise for meeting the criteria of high strength, thermal conductivity, and toughness required for the HSCT combustor liner. AFReCC received R&D Magazine's prestigious R&D 100 Award in 1995. The fabrication process for these composites has three steps. In the first step, fiber preforms are made and chemical vapor infiltration is used to apply the desired interface coating on the fibers. This step also rigidizes the preform. The second step consists of resin infiltration, which after pyrolysis, yields an interconnected network of porous carbon as the matrix. In the final step of the process, the carbon-containing preform is infiltrated with molten silicon or silicon <b>alloys</b> in a <b>furnace.</b> This converts the carbon to silicon carbide leaving as little as 5 percent residual free silicon or refractory disilicide phase.

Many jobbing foundries are constrained in furnace types and available foundry additives that the operation always results in white irons. This study is towards ensuring grey iron is reproduced from cast iron scrap auto engine blocks, when using a diesel fired rotary furnace and a FeSi alloy for structural modification (inoculation). With varying addition rate of the FeSi alloy to the tapped molten metal, chill wedge tests were performed on two different wedge samples of type W (according to ASTM A 367 - wedge test) with cooling modulus of 0. 45 cm (W 3 ½) and 0. 54 cm (W 4). The carbon equivalents for the test casts were within hypoeutectic range (3. 85 wt. (%) to 4. 11 wt. (%)). In the W 4 wedge sample, at 2. 0 wt.

The microstructure from the cast at this level of addition was free of carbidic phases; it shows randomly oriented graphite flakes evenly distributed in the iron matrix.

It contains mainly sulphur, iron jarosites, unleached base metals and platinum group metals (PGMs), which makes the treatment of SLC necessary. The SLC is currently toll-refined at Umicore’s Hoboken smelter and refinery to recover revenue from entrapped valuable metals. This method of treatment results in excessively high costs due to high transport and toll refining expenses as well as penalties. Thus, an in-house method of treatment by Anglo Platinum itself would prove beneficial in that it would eliminate these excessive costs and also provide a method of treatment {{in the event of}} residues exporting becoming banned or strongly penalised in future.

40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In this study, SiC {{reduction}} of Rowland and Easterns LG (Low Grade) concentrates was investigated. The {{purpose of the}} study was to investigate the feasibility of SiC as reductant with respect to metal fall, PGM grade in the alloy, slag composition, Cr solubility and overall PGM recovery. The integration of such process in the current matte-based collection process was also investigated. Currently, the matted-based collection process is most widely used for PGM recovery, but because PGM containing concentrates are becoming more enriched with UG 2 (Upper Group 2) LG concentrates, it is expected to be integrated or replaced with an alloy collection process. This kind of process offers greater flexibility to the different types of ore that could be used. The process is chromium tolerant and environmentally friendly. For this purpose Rowland and Easterns UG 2 LG Concentrate samples from Lonmin Western Platinum Limited were analysed with XRD, XRF and ICP-MS and it was found that SiO 2 and MgO are the most abundant oxides and Pd is the most abundant element from the PGMs. Sulphide bearing minerals such as chalcopyrite were detected in low concentrations (below 1 %) and Cr 2 O 3 concentrations are between 2 – 4 %. The FeO/SiO 2 ratio was lower in Rowland LG concentrate. SiC {{reduction of}} Rowland and Easterns concentrate was done at 1600 ℃. Reductant to concentrate ratios for laboratory scale experiments were ranged from 2. 5 to 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg concentrate. SiC reduction of Rowland concentrate had different reduction times. The duration of reduction experiments ranged from 30 - 180 min. PGM recoveries from SiC reduction of Rowland concentrate were very poor (below 10 %) and Fe recoveries were lower than 50 %. A slag viscosity at the end of the melt of more than 4 poise was responsible for poor phase separation. SEM images revealed metal prills entrained in the slag phase instead of settling and combining to the alloy globule at the bottom of the crucible. However, PGM recoveries from SiC reduction of Easterns concentrate was significantly better. More than 85 % of Ir and Pd and almost 60 % of Pt were recovered in a test with a reductant to concentrate ratio of 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg Easterns concentrate. Fe recovery was also the highest at 66 %. Cr and Si concentrations were below 5 % in total. The slag viscosity at the end of melt was calculated to be less than 4 poise and a SEM image of a slag sample revealed few entrained metal prills. After the above findings on the importance of viscosity, it was decided to increase the FeO content in the initial concentrate charge in order to decrease slag viscosity, increase metal fall (PGM collecting phase) and further increase PGM recovery. Peirce-Smith converter slag was used for this purpose. A test was conducted with the addition of 10 kg converter slag / 100 kg Easterns concentrate. The reductant to concentrate ratio was kept at 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg Easterns concentrate. The results revealed that Ir and Pd recoveries were more than 95 %, while Pt recovery was almost 70 %. Fe recovery increased to 76 %. On the basis of the results from the test, an optimum feed ratio between Easterns LG concentrate, Rowland concentrate and Peirce-Smith converter slag was calculated. Thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculations predicted that the concentrate charge should consist of 60 - 80 % Easterns concentrate with a slag addition of 30 – 40 kg converter slag / 100 kg LG concentrate. SiC reduction of this optimum LG concentrate charge is expected to recover more than 90 % of all PGMs. Cr and Si concentrations in the alloy will be below 1 % in total. The amount of converter slag as an addition will be however limited by final PGM grade in the <b>alloy,</b> <b>furnace</b> slag quantities recycled and slag resistivity required in the <b>alloy</b> <b>furnace.</b> The effectiveness of SiC as reductant was also compared to C reduction. C reduction of an optimum concentrate charge had a marginally higher metal fall at the same reductant to concentrate ratio than SiC reduction of an optimum concentrate charge. However, gas emissions are on average 3 times higher for C reduction of a concentrate charge and C reduction requires at least 300 MJ more to smelt 1 ton of LG concentrate than SiC reduction. This is mostly due to C reacting endothermically with FeO to produce Fe(l) and CO(g) in contrast to SiC reacting exothermically with FeO to produce Fe(l), SiO 2 (l) and CO(g). Integrating SiC reduction of LG concentrates into the existing smelting route at Lonmin was also proposed through a process flow diagram. From an economic point of view, it was found that SiC reduction of 1 ton of LG concentrate charge with a converter slag addition requires almost 700 MJ more than the smelting of a UG 2 blended concentrate to produce a matte phase. However it must be taken into account that the sulphide rich layers in the Bushveld complex are being depleted rapidly and alternative processes such as SiC reduction and alloy collection process will be utilized faster than expected. Moreover, gas emissions from reductive smelting is considerably lower, hence it is a more environmentally friendly process. Finally, from the findings of this study, it could be said that base metals and PGMs could be recovered in an iron alloy from SiC reduction of LG concentrate with converter slag additions. Therefore integrating such a process into the matte-based collection process could be considered as a future alternative to smelting UG 2 LG concentrates. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In hierdie studie, word SiC reduksie met Rowland en Oostelikes LG (Lae Graad) konsentrate ondersoek. Die doel van die studie was om die doeltreffendheid van SiC as reduktant te ondersoek met betrekking tot metaalval, PGM graad in die allooi, slaksamestelling (spesifiek word daar gekyk na Cr oplosbaarheid) en algehele PGM herwinning. Die integrasie van die proses in die huidige mat-gebaseerde versamelingproses word ook ondersoek. Tans word die mat-gebaseerde versamelingproses die algemeenste gebruik om PGM'e te kollekteer, maar omdat PGM konsentrate al hoe meer verryk word met UG 2 (Upper Group 2) LG konsentrate, word daar verwag dat dit geïntegreer of vervang gaan word met 'n allooi-versamelingproses. Hierdie tipe proses bied groter buigsaamheid om die verskillende reekse van erts wat gebruik kan word. Die proses kan ook chroom hanteer en is omgewingsvriendelik. Vir hierdie doel was Rowland en Oostelikes UG 2 LG konsentraatmonsters van Lonmin Western Platinum Limited ontleed met XRD, XRF en ICP -MS en met die ontleding was daar gevind dat SiO 2 en MgO die volopste oksides was en dat Pd die volopste elemente van die PGMe was. Sulfiedminerale soos chalkopiriet is in lae konsentrasies opgespoor (minder as 1 %) en Cr 2 O 3 konsentrasies is tussen 2 - 4 %. Die FeO/SiO 2 verhouding was laer in Rowland konsentraat. SiC reduksie van Rowland en Oostelikes konsentrate is teen 1600 ℃ uitgevoer. Die reduktant tot konsentraat verhouding vir laboratoriumskaal eksperimente het gewissel van 2. 5 – 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg konsentraat. SiC reduksie van Rowland LG konsentraat het verskillende reduksie tye gehad. Die duur van die reduksie eksperimente het gewissel van 30 - 180 min. PGM herwinning van SiC reduksie met Rowland konsentreer was baie laag (onder 10 %) en Fe herwinning was minder as 50 %. 'n Slakviskositeit aan die einde van die smelt was hoër as 4 poise en was verantwoordelik vir die swak skeiding van fases. SEM beelde het gewys dat fyn metaalstukkies opgehou was in die slakfase in plaas daarvan dat dit vestig en kombineer met die allooibolletjie aan die onderkant van die smeltkroes. In teenstelling was die PGM herwinning van SiC reduksie met Oostelikes konsentraat aansienlik beter. Meer as 85 % van Ir en Pd was herwin en byna 60 % van Pt was herwin tydens 'n toets met 'n reduktant tot konsentraat verhouding van 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg Oostelikes konsentraat. Fe herwinning was 66 % en was ook die hoogste van al die eksperimente. Cr en Si konsentrasies was minder as 5 % in totaal. Die slakviskositeit aan die einde van smelt was bereken en is minder as 4 posie. 'n SEM beeld van 'n slakmonster het baie min vasgevangde metaalstukkies getoon. Na afloop van die bogenoemde bevindinge oor die belangrikheid van viskositeit, was daar besluit om die FeO inhoud van die aanvanklike konsentraat te verhoog. Dit was gedoen om die slakviskositeit te verminder, die metaalval (PGM kollektering fase) te verhoog en sodoende die PGM herwinning verder te verbeter. Vir die doel was Peirce -Smith omskakelaarslak gebruik. ŉ Toets was uitgevoer met die toevoeging van 10 kg omskakelaarslak / 100 kg Oostelikes konsentraat. Die reduktant tot konsentraat verhouding was behou by 3. 5 kg SiC / 100 kg Oostelikes konsentraat. Die resultate het getoon dat meer as 95 % van Ir en Pd herwin was, terwyl byna 70 % Pt herwin was. Die Fe herwinning het toegeneem tot 76 %. Op grond van die resultate van die toets, is 'n optimale verhouding tussen Oostelikes konsentraat, Rowland konsentraat en Peirce -Smith omskakelaarslak bereken. Termodinamiese modellering voorspel dat die begin LG konsentraat voer uit 60 – 80 % Oostelikes konsentraat moet bestaan, met 'n slak toevoeging van 30 – 40 kg omskakelaarslak / 100 kg LG konsentraat. Daar word verwag dat meer as 90 % van PGM'e herwin sal word vanaf SiC reduksie met ŉ optimum LG konsentraat voer. Cr en Si konsentrasies in die allooi sal minder as 1 % in totaal wees. Die hoeveelheid slak wat bygevoeg kan word sal egter beperk word deur die finale PGM graad in die allooi, oond-slak hoeveelhede wat herwin kan word en slakweerstand wat benodig word in die allooi-oond. Die effektiwiteit van SiC as reduktant is ook vergelyk met C reduksie. C reduksie van ŉ optimale konsentraatvoer het 'n effens hoër metaalval wanneer dieselde reduktant tot konsentraat verhouding behou was vir SiC reduksie van 'n optimale konsentraatvoer. Gas hoeveelhede van C reduksie is gemiddeld 3 keer meer en vereis te minste 300 MJ meer om 1 ton LG konsentraat te smelt. Dit is hoofsaaklik te wydte aan C wat endotermies reageer met FeO om Fe (l) en CO (g) te produseer, in teenstelling met SiC wat eksotermies reageer met FeO om Fe (l), SiO 2 (l) en CO (g) te produseer. Integrasie van SiC reduksie met LG konsentrate in die bestaande smeltroete by Lonmin Western Platinum Limited is ook voorgestel deur 'n proses vloeidiagram. Uit 'n ekonomiese oogpunt, is daar gevind dat SiC reduksie van 1 ton LG konsentraatvoer met 'n omskakelaarslak byvoeging ongeveer 700 MJ meer benodig as om 1 ton UG 2 gemengde konsentraat te smelt en 'n mat-fase te produseer. Dit moet wel in ag geneem word dat die sulfied ryk lae in die Bosveld-kompleks vinnig uitgeput word en dat hierdie alternatiewe prosesse soos SiC reduksie en ŉ allooiversameling proses vinniger as verwagtend benut sal word. Verder, gas hoeveelhede van SiC reduksie is laer en daarom is dit 'n meer omgewingsvriendelik proses. Ten slotte, vanaf die bevindinge van hierdie studie, kan dit gesê word dat basismetale en PGM'e in 'n ysterallooi herwin kan word deur middel van SiC reduksie met LG konsentrate en die toevoeging van omskakelaarslak. Daarom kan die integrasie van so 'n proses in die huidige mat-gebaseerde versameling proses beskou word as 'n alternatief vir die toekoms om UG 2 LG konsentrate te smelt...|$|R
40|$|This project {{led to an}} {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms of dross formation. The microstructural evolution in industrial dross samples was determined. Results suggested that dross that forms in layers with structure and composition determined by the local magnesium concentration alone. This finding is supported by fundamental studies of molten metal surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that only magnesium segregates to the molten aluminum alloy surface and reacts to form a growing oxide layer. X-ray diffraction techniques that were using to investigate an oxidizing molten aluminum alloy surface confirmed {{for the first time}} that magnesium oxide is the initial crystalline phase that forms during metal oxidation. The analytical techniques developed in this project are now available to investigate other molten metal surfaces. Based on the improved understanding of dross initiation, formation and growth, technology was developed to minimize melt loss. The concept is based on covering the molten metal surface with a reusable physical barrier. Tests in a laboratory-scale reverberatory furnace confirmed the results of bench-scale tests. The main highlights of the work done include: A clear understanding of the kinetics of dross formation and the effect of different alloying elements on dross formation was obtained. It was determined that the dross evolves in similar ways regardless of the aluminum alloy being melted and the results showed that amorphous aluminum nitride forms first, followed by amorphous magnesium oxide and crystalline magnesium oxide in all alloys that contain magnesium. Evaluation of the molten aluminum alloy surface during melting and holding indicated that magnesium oxide is the first crystalline phase to form during oxidation of a clean aluminum alloy surface. Based on dross evaluation and melt tests it became clear that the major contributing factor to aluminum alloy dross was in the alloys with Mg content. Mg was identified as the primary factor that accelerates dross formation specifically in the transition from two phases to three phase growth. Limiting magnesium oxidation on the surface of molten aluminum therefore becomes the key to minimizing melt loss, and technology was developed to prevent magnesium oxidation on the aluminum surface. This resulted in a lot of the work being focused on the control of Mg oxidation. Two potential molten metal covering agents that could inhibit dross formation during melting and holding consisting of boric acid and boron nitride were identified. The latter was discounted by industry as it resulted in Boron pick up by the melt beyond that allowed by specifications during plant trials. The understanding of the kinetics of dross formation by the industry partners helped them understand how temperature, <b>alloy</b> chemistry and <b>furnace</b> atmosphere (burner controls [...] e. g. excess air) effected dross formation. This enables them to introduce in their plant process changes that reduced unnecessary holding at high temperatures, control burner configurations, reduce door openings to avoid ingress of air and optimize charge mixes to ensure rapid melting and avoid excess oxidation...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of waste}} (or recycled) wood as a fuel in heat and power {{stations}} is becoming more widespread in Sweden (and Europe), because it is CO 2 neutral with a lower cost than forest fuel. However, it is a heterogeneous fuel with a high amount of chlorine, alkali and heavy metals which causes more corrosion than fossil fuels or forest fuel. A part of the boiler which is subjected to a high corrosion risk is the furnace wall (or waterwall) which is formed of tubes welded together. Waterwalls are made of ferritic low-alloyed steels, due to their low price, low stress corrosion cracking risk, high heat transfer properties and low thermal expansion. However, ferritic low alloy steels corrode quickly when burning waste wood in a low NOx environment (i. e. an environment with low oxygen levels to limit the formation of NOx). Apart from pure oxidation two important forms of corrosion mechanisms are thought to occur in waste environments: chlorine corrosion and alkali corrosion. Although {{there is a great}} interest from plant owners to reduce the costs associated with furnace wall corrosion very little has been reported on wall corrosion in biomass boilers. Also corrosion mechanisms on furnace walls are usually investigated in laboratories, where interpretation of the results is easier. In power plants the interpretation is more complicated. Difficulties in the study of corrosion mechanisms are caused by several factors such as deposit composition, flue gas flow, boiler design, combustion characteristics and flue gas composition. Therefore, the corrosion varies from plant to plant and the laboratory experiments should be complemented with field tests. The present project may thus contribute to fill the power plant corrosion research gap. In this work, different kinds of samples (wall deposits, test panel tubes and corrosion probes) from Vattenfall’s Heat and Power plant in Nyköping were analysed. Coated and uncoated samples with different alloys and different times of exposure were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and light optical microscopy (LOM). The corrosive environment was also simulated by Thermo-Calc software. The results showed that a nickel alloy coating can dramatically reduce the corrosion rate. The corrosion rate of the low alloy steel tubes, steel 16 Mo 3, was linear and the oxide scale non-protective, but the corrosion rate of the nickel-based alloy was probably parabolic and the oxide much more protective. The nickel alloy and stainless steels showed good corrosion protection behavior in the boiler. This indicates that stainless steels could be a good (and less expensive) alternative to nickel-based <b>alloys</b> for protecting <b>furnace</b> walls. The nickel alloy coated tubes (and probe samples) were attacked by a potassium-lead combination leading to the formation of non-protective potassium lead chromate. The low alloy steel tubes corroded by chloride attack. Stainless steels were attacked by a combination of chlorides and potassium-lead. The Thermo-Calc modelling showed chlorine gas exists at extremely low levels (less than 0. 1 ppm) at the tube surface; instead the hydrated form is thermodynamically favoured, i. e. gaseous hydrogen chloride. Consequently chlorine can attack low alloy steels by gaseous hydrogen chloride rather than chlorine gas as previously proposed. This is a smaller molecule than chlorine which could easily diffuse through a defect oxide of the type formed on the steel. QC 20130423 </p...|$|R
