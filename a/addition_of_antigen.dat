40|$|Sera from {{guinea pigs}} given niridazole, an anti-schistosomal compound, {{have been shown}} to {{reversibly}} block the production of antigen-induced migration inhibitory factor by sensitized guinea pig lymph node cells. Since niridazole itself has no effect in vitro, the blockade of production of migration inhibitory factor is probably due to drug metabolites in the serum. We report here further studies on the mechanism of this drug-induced suppression of cellular hypersensitivity; the data show that niridazole active serum does not block the production of migration inhibitory factor once it has been initiated. Indeed, if niridazole active serum is added a little as 60 sec after the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> the lymphocytes will produce migration inhibitory factor. These results suggest the presence of at least two stages in production of migration inhibitory factor after the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> to lymphocytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is {{the most}} common cause of {{acquired}} epilepsy in Taenia solium endemic areas, primarily situated in low-income countries. Diagnosis is largely based upon the "Del Brutto diagnostic criteria" using the definitive/probable/no NCC diagnosis approach. Neuroimaging and specific T. solium cysticercosis antibody detection results are at the mainstay of this diagnosis, while antigen detection in serum has never been included. This study aimed at evaluating the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> detection as a major diagnostic criterion, especially in areas where neuroimaging is absent. METHODS: The B 158 /B 60 monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circulating cysticercus antigen was carried out retrospectively on serum samples collected during a hospital-based study from 83 people with epilepsy (PWE) in an endemic area. RESULTS: The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> results as a major criterion allowed the correct diagnosis of definitive NCC in 10 out of 17 patients as opposed to 0 / 17 without antigen results in the absence of neuroimaging. A sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 84 % were determined for the diagnosis of active NCC using antigen ELISA. While the use of a higher cutoff improves the specificity of the test to 96 %, it decreases its sensitivity to 83 %. CONCLUSIONS: In areas where neuroimaging is absent, NCC diagnosis according to the existing criteria is problematic. Taking into account its limitations for diagnosis of inactive NCC, antigen detection can be of added value for diagnosing NCC in PWE by supporting diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, we recommend a revision of the "Del Brutto diagnostic criteria" for use in resource poor areas and suggest the inclusion of serum antigen detection as a major criterion...|$|E

40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important diseases of citrus in the world. To avoid the destructive effect of the disease, early detection of infected plants is crucial. Therefore, simple and sensitive diagnosis tools are decisive. The main objective of the present study was developing nanobiosensors for detection of citrus tristeza based on the florescence emission of cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe-QDs). To achieve that, CdTe-QD particles were initially synthesized and effectively conjugated to CTV coat protein (CTV-CP) corresponding antibody. In a parallel reaction, rhodamine dye molecules were attached to the purified recombinant CTV-CP. Two independent approaches were explored for detection of the infected plants. First, in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assay, the quenching ability of rhodamine molecules was applied for altering the QDs light emission. More specifically, donor- acceptor complexes (Ab-QD+CP-Rd) were created based on the affinity <b>of</b> antibody- <b>antigen</b> molecules. The resulting assembly brought Ab-QD (the donor) and the Rd-CP (the acceptor) into a close proximity and resulted in a substantial decrease in the intensity of QD light emission. <b>Addition</b> <b>of</b> free <b>antigen</b> into the solution resulted in the replacement of CP-Rd with free CP and a subsequent increase in the emission of QDs. In the second approach, a non-FRET based assay was performed through the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> free <b>antigen</b> to the Ab-QD solution, which led to the aggregation of the Ab-QD conjugates and consequently a significant increase in the light intensity emission of the QD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the non-FRET based assay developed herein is being reported...|$|R

Therefore, {{it has been a}} central question which cell type is responsible for the initiation of a protective immune response. In the early stage of an anti-Leishmania immune response, detectable Leishmania major antigen was localized in the paracortex of the draining lymph nodes (LN). Characterization of antigen-positive cells showed that L. major co-localized with DC of a CD 11 c+ CD 8 α- Langerin- phenotype. To determine the area <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> uptake, dermis or epidermis, and to further define the type of antigen-transporting cells, L. major was inoculated subcutaneously and concurrently LC were mobilized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). After 3 days, DC carrying L. major antigenwere always FITC-, indicating a dermal and not an epidermal origin. Moreover, <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> L. major <b>antigen</b> to ex vivo isolated CD 8 α- and CD 8 + DC fromthe draining LN of L. major-infected C 57 BL/ 6 mice demonstrated that both DC subpopulations were able to stimulate antigen-specific T cell proliferation in vitro.
