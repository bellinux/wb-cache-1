5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003. The fourth named storm of the 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Delfina formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar on December30, 2002. It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December31. Delfina weakened while moving inland, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January1, 2003. However, its remnants {{moved across the}} country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January9.|$|E
5|$|That evening, von Greim and Reitsch {{flew out}} from Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 trainer. Field Marshal von Greim {{was ordered to}} get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached Potsdamerplatz (only a city block from the Führerbunker). During the night of 28 April, General Wenck {{reported}} to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer possible for his army to relieve Berlin. Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government {{required}} that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb {{and one to}} move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb {{was placed on the}} crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, {{the use of}} the Manorville Branch {{for service}} between the forks declined, and limited service using the line {{continued}} into the World War II years, and in 1946 the line was removed from timetables, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer used after March 3, 1949. On November 25, 1949, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the LIRR's request to abandon the line, and the tracks were removed in the winter of 1950.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} extremity of the drainage district lies Sutton St Edmund. Its commons were enclosed in 1797, and an Act of Parliament was obtained to drain them in 1809. The first recorded steam-powered pumping {{station in the}} Fens was erected there in 1817, to pump water into the South Holland Main Drain. It was a double-acting machine, of , but was removed in 1834/5, when the North Level Main Drain was constructed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer needed.|$|E
25|$|The Bell Telephone Company {{was created}} in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company {{engineers}} made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which {{emerged as one of}} the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.|$|E

25|$|After a new Virginia state {{constitution}} was adopted in 1871, independent cities, which {{were no longer}} located politically within counties, were created. Soon, Williamsburg's charter was modified, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer located within either county. However, although politically separate entities, Williamsburg has remained the county seat of James City County, {{and they continue to}} share many services, including courts, several constitutional officers and a joint public school system. A most notable-and notorious-resident of Williamsburg is John Hinckley Jr., the perpetuator of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.|$|E
25|$|The Great Red Spot {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft. Note that a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer present as of 1994 (although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north).|$|E
25|$|Remarkably, {{when the}} sizzling, dry weather returned, Warwickshire, with Foster and Frank Field making {{unrivalled}} use of extremely fast wickets, won match after match – only {{stopped by a}} few draws due to heavy scoring – to claim the Championship. In this period, Foster scored 200 against Surrey and 105 in an hour against Yorkshire, and achieved such bowling feats as 11 for 73 at Northampton in the final match. For the whole season, Foster headed both batting and bowling averages for his county, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> surprise {{when he went to}} Australia for the 1911/1912 Ashes tour.|$|E

25|$|From 13 December 1965 Skarpsno Station was {{remotely}} controlled from the signal box at OsloV, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer manned by a train dispatcher. Ticket sales continued {{until they were}} terminated on 1 March 1968. Following {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel, which opened on 1 June 1980, services to OsloV were reduced. Skarpsno was, along with Oslo V, the only station on the old part of the Drammen Line, which was renamed the Skøyen–Filipstad Line. Oslo West Station terminated services on 28 May 1989 and so did Skarpsno on the same day. The station building was demolished in 1993.|$|E
25|$|A {{private company}} built the Highlands Turnpike to the west, in more level country, {{and opened it}} in 1806. This {{diverted}} traffic away from the section north of Peekskill through Continental Village and past the lakes. Iron mining at Hopper Lake in the 1820s partially replaced it, and the stage route was not changed. The old road fell into further disuse when the turnpike became a public highway in 1833 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer needed as a shunpike. The completion of the Hudson River Railroad to Albany in 1850 made the road obsolete as a commercial and postal artery, and stage service ended.|$|E
25|$|While in Tokyo, Soong Ai-ling {{had married}} H. H. Kung, a wealthy banker, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer {{suitable}} {{for her to}} work as Sun Yat-Sen's secretary. Instead, Soong Ching-ling took the job in 1914 while in Tokyo. The relationship between Ching-ling and Sun soon turned romantic, and when Charlie Soong moved his family back to Shanghai in 1916, they secretly kept in touch. It was however problematic to pursue this relationship, as Sun was already married. Thus, Charlie was outraged when Ching-ling asked {{to go back to}} Japan to join Sun. When she then defied him and escaped on a boat to Tokyo {{in the middle of the}} night, it was enough for Charlie to break all ties with Sun and disown his daughter.|$|E
50|$|However, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} foundress of the congregation, Sister Julie Green, F.S.J., {{due to her}} alleged condition of being a transsexual.

50|$|However, the {{buoyancy}} {{of water}} negates {{to some extent}} the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures {{that would be required}} of similarly sized land creatures, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> coincidence that the largest animals to ever exist on earth are aquatic animals.|$|R
25|$|In March 2006 {{players and}} {{officials}} started to rebel against this controversial rule and a One Day International series between South Africa and Australia saw the players agree {{to boycott the}} rule.

25|$|Most of the United Irish {{leadership}} and ideologues were born into Presbyterian families. While the United Irish had declared {{themselves to be}} non-sectarian from 1791, there were other liberal Protestants in the Irish Parliament who were also anti-sectarian and sought a more democratic franchise, such as Henry Grattan and John Philpot Curran. Although the United Irishmen was a staunchly non-sectarian body which sought to unite all Irishmen, regardless of religion or descent many among their ranks were former Defenders, a term applied to many loosely connected, exclusively Catholic, agrarian resistance groups. Many of these men, {{as well as their}} Presbyterian counterparts in Ulster, had been shaped by the sectarianism that was prevalent in eighteenth century Ireland <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> mean feat to persuade Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter to put aside their differences and view each other simply as fellow Irishmen. Although the project met with remarkable success, it was quickly recognised by the establishment that sectarianism was a useful ally in the fight against the United Irishmen.|$|E
25|$|The Forty-Two Articles were {{intended}} to summarise Anglican doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of Edward VI, who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, {{they were to be}} short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in Scripture and the existing Catholic creeds. Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553. The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful. With the coronation of Mary I and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced. However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles. In 1563, Convocation met under Archbishop Parker to revise the articles. Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings. In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop Edmund Gheast, was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ. This was done following the queen's excommunication by the Pope Pius V in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities. The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent.|$|E
500|$|Jason Jacobs, a {{lecturer}} in {{film and television}} studies at the University of Warwick, wrote in his 2000 history of early British television drama that [...] "It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly... Kneale and Cartier shared a common desire to invigorate television with a faster tempo and a broader thematic and spatial canvas, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> coincidence that they turned to science-fiction {{in order to get}} out of the dominant stylistic trend of television intimacy." ...|$|E

Bridges were constructed to Lindås, Askøy and Sotra, and large parking garages were built in the city center.

Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrasted with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims she did as she said <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> big deal.|$|E
500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City.

[...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of}} the 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable.
