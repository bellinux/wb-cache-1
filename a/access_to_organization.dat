40|$|Abstract. Intrusion {{detection}} systems gather {{large quantities}} of host and network information {{in an attempt to}} detect and respond to attacks against an organization. The widely varying nature of attacks makes humans essential for analysis, but the sheer volume of data can quickly overwhelm even experienced analysts. Existing approaches utilize visualization to provide rapidly comprehensible representations of the data, but fail to scale to real-world environments due to unrealistic data handling and lack of response facilities. This paper introduces a new tool for security event monitoring, analysis, and response called Savors. Savors provides suitable scalability by utilizing three additional areas of computing. High-end computing brings large amounts of on-demand processing to bear on the problem. Auralization allows both monitoring and analysis to be performed in parallel. Finally, grid computing provides the basis for remote data access and response capabilities with seamless and secure <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organization</b> resources. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Trusted {{insiders}} that betray {{an organization}} can inflict substantial harm. In {{addition to having}} privileged <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organization</b> resources and information, these users may {{be familiar with the}} defenses surrounding valuable assets. Computers systems at the organization need a mechanism for communicating suspicious activity that is difficult for a malicious insider (or even an outsider) to detect or block. In this work, we propose a covert channel in the Ethernet frame that allows a computer system to report activity inside other, unrelated network communication. The covert channel leverages the differences in the framing approaches used by Ethernet and IP packets to append hidden information to IP packet and transmit it to an organization’s administrator. This stealthy communication is difficult for even advanced attackers and is challenging to block since it opportunistically uses unrelated communication. Further, since the transmission is tied to the Ethernet frame, the communication cannot traverse network routers, preventing security information from leaving the organization. We introduce the covert channel, incorporate it into a working prototype, and combine it with an intrusion detection system to show its promise for security event reporting. I...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Personalization and the non-territorial office {{seem to be}} contradicting concepts. It is {{generally}} accepted {{that it is not}} possible to personalize workplaces in environments where no fixed individual workplaces are allocated. However, people seem to have a human need of personalization. Personalization can be done in different ways and for different reasons. Based on a literature review and a qualitative case study at a Dutch governmental organization, the purpose of this paper is to explain why and how personalization occurs in environments where non-territorial office concepts are introduced. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative interpretative research design, in which literature study, document analysis, observations and talking, and interviews are combined, to understand the actor’s perspective and behavior in the non-territorial office of organization X. Findings – Conclusions of the study indicate personalization to be a relevant factor for consideration when implementing a non-territorial office design: when objects are prohibited to personalize your work environment, people seek several additional ways to make the environment familiar and comfortable for them and to mark their identity in the organization. Research limitations/implications – <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organization</b> X went via top management, which makes it possible that the position of the independent researcher was not clear to people. The research took place in three months, but not full time. Missing important behaviors is amongst possible consequences for the findings. Since this is one case study, further research is recommended. Practical implications – Balanced decisions and rules between organizational policy and human needs help the acceptance of own workplace lost in non-territorial offices. Originality/value – Personalization is a well-researched subject; as applied in non-territorial offices, it is not well researched yet. This research paper suggests that aspects of emotion and psychological need should be considered as well in the development of a non-territorial office.

40|$|This article {{uses the}} case of India to suggest that North and his colleagues’ {{explanations}} of open access orders do not explain well the contemporary developing countries. The political system of India after independence was mainly based on the British model and with influences from the US and French models. Despite India’s practice of Western style of democracy, economic and/or human development records remained poor {{until the end of}} 1970 s and even far beyond. Since the 1980 s, however, India started to liberalize the economy. Focusing on the open <b>access</b> <b>to</b> economic <b>organizations</b> and/or activities has led to better institutional building. While India {{still has a long way}} to go in terms of institutional development, it has emphasized or devoted more resources to the development of institutions in the areas of property rights protection and contract enforcement, financial market, rule of law, and human resource accumulation. The study of India reveals that if a developing country has difficulty of achieving open <b>access</b> both <b>to</b> political <b>organizations</b> and activities and <b>to</b> economic <b>organizations</b> and activities, prioritizing the open <b>access</b> <b>to</b> economic <b>organizations</b> and activities is likely to produce better economic and human development consequences. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: The home is {{imperative}} for {{the possibilities for}} meaningful everyday activities among people with psychiatric disabilities. Knowledge of whether such possibilities vary with type of housing and housing support might reveal areas for improved support. We aimed to compare people with psychiatric disabilities living in supported housing (SH) and ordinary housing with support (OHS) regarding perceived well-being, engaging and satisfying everyday activities, and perceived meaning of activity in one's accommodation. The importance of these factors and socio-demographics for satisfaction with housing was also explored. Methods: This naturalistic cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} municipalities and city districts (n = 21) in Sweden, and 155 SH residents and 111 OHS residents participated in an interview that included both self-reports and interviewer ratings. T-test and linear regression analysis were used. Results: The SH group expressed more psychological problems, but better health, quality of life and personal recovery compared to the OHS residents. The latter were rated as having less symptom severity, and higher levels of functioning and activity engagement. Both groups rated themselves as under-occupied in the domains of work, leisure, home management and self-care, but the SH residents less so regarding home management and self-care chores. Although the groups reported similar levels of activity, the SH group were more satisfied with everyday activities and rated their housing higher on possibilities for social interaction and personal development. The groups did not differ on access to activity in their homes. The participants generally reported sufficient access to activity, social interaction and personal development, but those who wanted more personal development in the OHS group outnumbered those who stated they received enough. Higher scores on satisfaction with daily occupations, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organization</b> and information, wanting more social interaction, and personal recovery predicted high satisfaction with housing in the regression model. Conclusion: The fact that health, quality of life and recovery were rated higher by the SH group, despite lower interviewer-ratings on symptoms and level of functioning, might partly be explained by better access to social interaction and personal development in the SH context. This should be acknowledged when planning the support to people who receive OHS...|$|E
40|$|In {{contemporary}} organisations {{the evolution}} of technology and increased competition has accentuated the need for strategic imperatives {{to ensure that the}} traditional sales organisation is transformed from tactical management of sales transactions to the strategic management of complex strategic customer portfolios and customer relationship for a company’s long-term growth (Olson et al., 2001; Piercy and Lane, 2005). How management can ensure a successful shift from the conventional sales philosophy to the strategic one is a challenge in many sales organisations. In this case study of a sales organisation in a multinational company, an examination is undertaken of a strategic transformation that involves a new sales philosophy and the associated sales force automation (SFA) system. Such transformation calls for the sales organisation to shift from tactical and transactional-based selling approach to strategic value creation-based practices. The transition is necessarily supported by SFA system implementation, to which the adoption is invariably hampered by an alarming rate of failures (Bush et al., 2005). So {{what can be done to}} ensure a successful shift from the current sales philosophy to the new one supported by the new SFA system? How can management purposely shape the interpretations of the organisation's environment in order that employees understand and 'enact' strategic change (Daft and Weick, 1984; Reger et al., 1994) ? In order to explore these questions, a social interactionist (Goffman, 1974) methodological approach is taken to examine the meanings inherent in individual and collective interactions and negotiations. The concept of framing is utilised as an analytical lens to understand strategic changes (Kaplan, 2008) occurring within the case study. Whilst framing as a conceptual bridge linking social psychological and resource mobilization has been researched in social movement participation (Snow et al., 1986; Benford, 1993; Benford and Snow, 2000; Reber and Berger, 2005), little progress has been made using such micro-level analysis in understanding mobilizing strategic change in sales organisation in a theoretically informed and empirically grounded fashion. The overarching aims of this study are therefore to provide a deeper understanding of how management frame such strategic changes in sales philosophy and how the resulting frames are accepted or otherwise in a sales workforce automation and transformation programme. Applying a framing concept to the analysis of strategic change within the organisation enables us to move away from viewing organisation as a static entity or a fixed structure (Putnam and Nicotera, 2009) and get into the minds of management and employees to understand the internal struggles that are taking place. Most importantly, in this study, as compared to previous works using framing theory to interpret strategic decision making (Kaplan, 2008), this research goes beyond analyzing individual framing practices of key organisational decision makers (senior management) to study how cognitive frames can shape strategic objectives by framing messages to other organisational actors (sales employees) who are required to adopt the intended strategic change. By analysing both managerial framing practice and employee frame alignment as well as the degree of collective action mobilization (Klandermans, 1984), it offers a complete picture of how strategically inclined managers try to change the organisation status quo and how they employ various managerial framing practices to gain support for transformational change of sales philosophy. At the same time, it provides an account of how employees respond to strategic frame alignment process, such that they either accept the frames and take collective action accordingly or partially accept them and take deferred action or passively participate. The primary contributions of this study to framing theory are: first of all, it advances Kaplan’s (2008) original framing contest theory by demonstrating collective action frames are not static characterizations but can be changed or redefined with purposeful managerial framing and reframing. The framing outcome been focused in this research is employee’s collective action which is a step further from meaning construction in strategic decision making as in Kaplan’s (2008) research. Secondly, while Kaplan (2008) demonstrated how different organization actors attempt to make their frame resonate and mobilize action in their favour, this research focuses on the interplay between management and employees who have unequal <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organization</b> resources due to organization hierarchy. It shows that despite of the differences, employees are not mere recipient of managerial framing whose only role is to respond (or not) to the framed meanings. Instead, their subsequent reactions to managerial framing shape collective action frame and the resulted action. Finally, it confirms the distinction between consensus mobilization and action mobilization (Klandermans, 1984) which separates management’s focus of convincing and activating, and shows how resonance of legitimacy and motivation frames are both necessary conditions for employee action mobilization. This research also contributes to strategic change studies by showing what constitutes effective managerial framing practices to enable strategic change in sales organisations with a theoretical framework that demonstrates how managerial frames are introduced, contested and aligned or partially aligned and the resulting employee participation level. Such a theoretical framework is both empirically informed and practically useful for strategic change practitioners as it delineates factors that determine effectiveness of management’s framing efforts in mobilizing employees for action thus help them to evaluate and predict the effectiveness of managerial framing effort and possible outcomes. Finally, this research contributes to sales technology literature by providing a better understanding of how technological frames affect SFA adoption by sales workforce and how management can strategically frame SFA and its value to achieve desired results...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} of access in ethnographic research are well-documented in methodological literature, but poorly described in many empirical studies. To date, very {{little research has}} focused on <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organizations.</b> In this article, I describe the ongoing access challenges in a period of fieldwork in UK Jobcentre Plus (welfare) offices.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} my new book (North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009) {{to provide a}} new {{explanation}} for {{why it is so}} difficult to transplant institutions, such as markets and democracy, from developed societies into developing ones. This framework divides societies into two different types of social order, natural states (which include most developing countries) and open access orders (which include the developed ones). Missing from traditional approaches is how societies reduce or control the problem of violence. Natural states solve the problem of violence through rent-creation, granting powerful individuals and groups valuable rights and privileges so that they have incentives to cooperate rather than fight. The resulting rents, limits on competition, and limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organizations</b> hinder long-term economic development. In contrast, open access orders use competition, open <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>organizations,</b> and institutions <b>to</b> control violence and are characterized by rent-erosion and long-term economic growth. I focus on two aspects of the rule of law: certainty and equality before the law; and that the law must not only hold today but also tomorrow. I show that rule of law requires that the state treat people impersonally in the sense that in a large group of citizens all are treated alike; and that the state is perpetual in the sense that state institutions do not depend on the identity of the current rulers or supporting coalition. The problem is that few natural states are impersonal or perpetual. Therefore they cannot exhibit the rule of law. No matter how attractive are today's institutions or rights, they are no good in the long-term if tomorrow's regime can alter them at will. The absence of impersonality and a perpetual state prevents natural states from creating the rule of law...|$|R
