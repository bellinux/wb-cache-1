30|$|At the {{beginning}} of this section, we have mentioned there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> algorithms in the boosting method family. Gradient boosting and AdaBoost are two common ones of them. If we view from an abstract point, both of them get solved with the help of convex loss function. But gradient boosting can get more types of loss function. What is more, GB could deal with both regression and classification. In classification mode, log loss function is always the best objective function while AdaBoost will choose exponential loss. If you want to tell them from the fundamental element, the crucial question is how to identify the model. AdaBoost utilizes the misclassification to adjust the weight of weak learners whereas GB applies Negative gradient to ameliorate.|$|R

Just for this reason the Greco family represented an obstacle: the cause which roused the conflict was the approaching of some members of Cosa Nostra to the rival clan of Grecos.
