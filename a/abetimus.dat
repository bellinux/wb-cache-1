It {{is made of}} four double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides that are attached to a carrier platform and are designed to block specific B-cell anti double stranded DNA antibodies. [...] It may also complex anti dsDNA antibodies together, therefore disabling them. This way <b>abetimus</b> was supposed to help treat systemic lupus erythematosus and specifically lupus nephritis.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether treatment with <b>abetimus</b> delays renal flare {{in patients with}} lupus nephritis. Secondary objectives included evaluation {{of the effect of}} <b>abetimus</b> on C 3 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels, use of high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, and major systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study of treatment with <b>abetimus</b> at 100 mg/week for up to 22 months in SLE patients. Three hundred seventeen patients with a history of renal flare and anti-dsDNA levels > 15 IU/ml were randomized to a treatment group (158 <b>abetimus,</b> 159 placebo); 298 (94 %) were enrolled in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (145 <b>abetimus,</b> 153 placebo), based on the presence of high-affinity antibodies for the oligonucleotide epitope of <b>abetimus</b> at baseline screening. RESULTS: <b>Abetimus</b> did not significantly prolong time to renal flare, time to initiation of high-dose corticosteroid and/or cyclophosphamide treatment, or time to major SLE flare. However, there were 25 % fewer renal flares in the <b>abetimus</b> group compared with the placebo group (17 of 145 abetimus-treated patients [12 %] versus 24 of 153 placebo-treated patients [16 %]). <b>Abetimus</b> treatment decreased anti-dsDNA antibody levels (P or = 50 % reductions in proteinuria at 1 year, compared with the placebo group (nominal P = 0. 047). Trends toward reduced rates of renal flare and major SLE flare were noted in patients treated with <b>abetimus</b> who had impaired renal function at baseline. Treatment with <b>abetimus</b> for up to 22 months was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: <b>Abetimus</b> at 100 mg/week significantly reduced anti-dsDNA antibody levels but did not significantly prolong time to renal flare when compared with placebo. Multiple positive trends in renal end points were observed in the <b>abetimus</b> treatment group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Kidney {{involvement}} in SLE {{is quite common}} and carries a poor prognosis. Proliferative lupus nephritis is of major concern as it can present with renal impairment and may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A major advance in lupus pathogenesis has been the discovery that the disease is at least, in part, {{the result of an}} autoantigen-driven immune response. β cells trap circulating DNA-binding proteins, such as nucleosomes, through their membrane-bound anti-DNA antibody. Anti-dsDNA antibodies have also been shown to directly bind to human mesangial cells in vitro. Autoantibodies against C 1 q, a complement component, have also been incriminated in lupus nephritis. With better understanding of the pathogenesis and concerns regarding cumulative toxicity of cyclophosphamide, newer drug protocols and agents have been evaluated. Low dose fortnightly pulses of cyclophosphamide {{have been shown to be}} equally effective but less toxic as induction therapy. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has also been shown to be a promising drug for induction therapy, with fewer side effects. For maintenance therapy, azathioprine and MMF seem to be better alternatives to cyclophosphamide as they are equally effective but less toxic. Cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulins and rituximab can be considered as alternative therapies in patients who are resistant to cyclophosphamide. β cell tolerization (LJP- 934) (<b>abetimus</b> sodium), anti-CD 40 ligand monoclonal antibody, anti IL 10 monoclonal antibody are currently under evaluation for the treatment of lupus nephritis...|$|E
40|$|Loss of B-cell {{tolerance}} is {{a hallmark}} {{feature of the}} pathogenesis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production. These autoantibodies lead to formation of immune-complex deposition in internal organs causing inflammation and damage. Autoreactive B-cells {{are believed to be}} central in the pathophysiology of SLE. Other than its role in the production of antibodies that mediate humoral immune response, B-cells also function as antigen-presenting cells and are capable of activating T-cells. Activated B-cells may also produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate local inflammation. Abnormal B-cell homeostasis has been described in SLE patients. This may occur as a result of intrinsic B-cell defect or from aberrant regulation by maturation and survival signals. B-cell-based therapy is the current mainstream of research and development of novel therapies in SLE patients with severe and refractory disease. Potential cellular and molecular targets for B-cell therapies include cell surface molecules such as CD 20 (rituximab) and CD 22 (epratuzumab); co-stimulatory molecules involved in B-cell-T-cell interaction such as CTLA 4 and B 7 molecules (abatacept); maturation and growth factors such as B-cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand (belimumab, briobacept, atacicept) and B-cell tolerogen (<b>abetimus).</b> This article provides an overview on normal B-cell physiology and abnormal B-cell biology in SLE that form the immunological basis of B-cell-targeted therapy in the treatment of these patients with refractory diseases. © Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{disease is}} one of the most severe aspects of {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE), potentially leading to irreversible kidney failure. The standard of care for severe lupus nephritis involves the use of high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and other immunosuppressive drugs. Although these drugs are effective in controlling disease activity in the majority of patients, up to 25 % of patients treated with cyclophosphamide-based protocols develop renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease, and treatment discontinuation is associated with the occurrence of flares. Furthermore, these therapies are associated with a high incidence of short- and long-term side effects. LJP- 394 (<b>abetimus</b> sodium) is an investigational agent specifically designed to decrease anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and it is under development for the prevention of nephritic flares in patients with SLE since the early 1990 s. The drug has been evaluated in 13 clinical trials that evaluated > 800 patients with SLE, over a 10 -year time span. It is likely that LJP- 394 might have a role in the prevention of renal flares in SLE patients, and if the initial data is confirmed in an ongoing trial, this drug could represent either a substitute for immunosuppressive drugs or could allow a reduction of their dose, thereby reducing the risks of short- and long-term side effects. This paper reviews the principal aspects of chemistry, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of LJP- 394, and analyses studies on animal models and clinical studies conducted in the last few years...|$|E
