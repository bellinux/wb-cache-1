They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E

5|$|The first European Americans {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden who {{traveled}} north through the Rogue Valley on February 14, 1827. The first non-indigenous settlers <b>arrived</b> <b>a</b> few decades later. The sudden increase in population created conflicts with the Latgawa, which ultimately led to the Rogue River Wars of 1855 and 1856. After the wars, the remaining Latgawa were forced hundreds of miles north to the Siletz Reservation on the central Oregon Coast.|$|E

Zimri-Lim's ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim-Lim I affected Mari's status, Zimri-Lim referred to Yarim-Lim as his father, and the Yamhadite king was able to order Mari as the mediator between Yamhad's main deity Hadad and Zimri-Lim, who declared himself a servant of Hadad.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe <b>arrived</b> <b>a</b> short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E

5|$|Desaix’s arrival around 5:30 pm stabilised the French {{position}} as the 9th Light Infantry Regiment delayed the Austrian advance down the main road {{and the rest of}} the army re-formed north of Cascina Grossa. As the pursuing Austrian troops <b>arrived,</b> <b>a</b> mix of musketry and artillery fire concealed the surprise attack of Général de Brigade (GdB) François Étienne de Kellermann’s cavalry, which threw the Austrian pursuit into disordered flight back into Alessandria, with about 14,000 killed, wounded, or captured. The French casualties were considerably fewer, but included Desaix. The whole French line chased after the Austrians to seal une victoire politique (a political victory) that secured Bonaparte’s grip on power after the coup. It would be followed by a propaganda campaign, which sought to rewrite the story of the battle three times during Napoleon’s rule.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April, the Bosnian Croat TO {{captured}} Gornji Malovan. At {{the same}} time, the Bosnian Croat TO received reinforcements from Posušje, {{as well as}} a company from Bugojno and Uskoplje each. Fighting intensified as the JNA reinforcements <b>arrived.</b> <b>A</b> part of the Croatian reinforcements, which had just arrived from Bugojno and Uskoplje, fled after coming under attack near Zlosela. However, the JNA failed to achieve a breakthrough—even with five attack helicopters deployed in support of its advance towards Zlosela and Kupreška Vrata at 1:30 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name.

By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians <b>arrived</b> <b>a</b> day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they <b>arrived,</b> <b>a</b> heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|With a {{strength}} that {{continued to grow}} until there was about 350 men around the bridge, the charges that had {{been placed on the}} bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge as they waited for 50th Division to arrive. Over {{the course of the next}} few hours they were subjected to mortar fire and shelling from a Panzer IV tank. Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army <b>arrived</b> <b>a</b> short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they <b>arrived,</b> <b>a</b> Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E
