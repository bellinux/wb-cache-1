5|$|With {{regard to}} <b>alcoholism,</b> BAC {{is useful to}} judge alcohol tolerance, {{which in turn is}} a sign of <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of <b>alcoholism.</b> Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of <b>alcoholism,</b> and may be indicated by a family history of <b>alcoholism.</b> One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to <b>alcoholism</b> {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of <b>alcoholism,</b> and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} <b>alcoholism</b> with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with <b>alcoholism</b> is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, <b>alcoholism</b> is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible <b>alcoholism.</b> Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A fastidious and {{somewhat}} withdrawn individual, Balfour succumbed to <b>alcoholism</b> in his fifties. This brought about his early death.|$|E
5|$|An {{employer}} who terminates {{an employee}} {{for being an}} alcoholic is {{in violation of the}} state's anti-discrimination laws unless they can show that person's condition affected their job performance or created a substantial safety risk. No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or <b>alcoholism,</b> and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for <b>alcoholism.</b> Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for <b>alcoholism</b> that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of <b>alcoholism.</b> A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in <b>alcoholism.</b> There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{had become}} {{increasingly}} frustrated with Rose's <b>alcoholism,</b> and in November 1909 he divorced {{her on the}} grounds of his own adultery. Lola was entrusted to Rose's care; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine. Her <b>alcoholism</b> worsened, and as a result she was institutionalised in September 1911.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{was again}} {{nominated}} for Aberdeenshire in July 1790 and was appointed after Skene withdrew when his <b>alcoholism</b> began to blight his political career.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing <b>alcoholism.</b> Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of <b>alcoholism</b> than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of <b>alcoholism</b> among Native Americans compared to <b>alcoholism</b> levels in caucasians.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that McCarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{disease states}} can also {{increase}} the risk of developing tuberculosis. These include <b>alcoholism</b> and diabetes mellitus (three-fold increase).|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of <b>alcoholism.</b> Those who approach <b>alcoholism</b> as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since <b>alcoholism</b> involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for <b>alcoholism</b> typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, Friedrich Knilli, Marian never forgave {{himself for}} having {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Süß. Knilli ascribes Marian's <b>alcoholism</b> and alleged suicide after the war to his feelings of guilt.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{prolific}} {{writing in the}} 1960s, Ochs's mental stability declined in the 1970s. He eventually succumbed {{to a number of}} problems including bipolar disorder and <b>alcoholism,</b> and committed suicide in 1976.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alcoholism</b> is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. <b>Alcoholism</b> can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|At a {{particularly}} {{high risk for}} misuse and dependence are people {{with a history of}} <b>alcoholism</b> or drug abuse and/or dependence and people with borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|Australian Crawl were {{associated}} with surf music and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984. However, they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism, <b>alcoholism,</b> car accidents, and cautionary tales of romance.|$|E
5|$|Dahl has battled <b>alcoholism</b> {{throughout}} his adult life, {{which he has}} alluded {{to a number of}} times. He has been sober since 1995, the day after a drinking bout at the White Sox home opener, achieving it cold turkey.|$|E
5|$|During March 2015, Hamm's {{representative}} {{confirmed that}} Hamm had recently completed inpatient treatment for <b>alcoholism.</b> Additionally, Hamm reported developing vitiligo throughout {{the filming of}} Mad Men.|$|E
5|$|During the offseason, {{he lives}} in St. Louis. He married Mairin (née O’Leary) in September 2016. Freese credits the {{relationship}} with Mairin and seeing a social worker with helping him get through his depression and <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marshall's <b>alcoholism</b> {{had begun}} to {{interfere}} with his busy life prior to his marriage. He arrived at court hung-over on several occasions {{and was unable to}} keep his addiction secret in his small hometown. His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen. Thereafter, he became active in temperance organizations and delivered several speeches about the dangers of liquor. Although he had stopped drinking, his past <b>alcoholism</b> was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{segments}} {{deal with}} adult themes; characters use euphemisms {{to refer to}} their sex drives and often consume alcohol. They often contradict each other and act obnoxiously and lasciviously. They grapple with adult issues including death, sexual intercourse, and <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E

5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from <b>alcoholism</b> are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. <b>Alcoholism</b> is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. <b>Alcoholism</b> can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from <b>alcoholism.</b> As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
5|$|Tim Riggins is {{struggling}} with <b>alcoholism</b> and absentee parents, with few prospects beyond high school. He is portrayed as a loyal friend with a good heart.|$|E
5|$|A {{hospital}} was established at Fort Russell for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon {{at the hospital}} treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery. Dysentery was {{the leading cause of}} death at the fort, followed by malaria, tuberculosis, gunshot wounds and <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{her parents}} {{divorced}} {{when she was}} approximately four years old, Laurer had three different stepfathers and one stepmother. According to Laurer, her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point, and her biological father, who once accidentally stabbed her mother in the thigh with a bread knife, {{had a problem with}} <b>alcoholism.</b> From 1973 to 1983, she, her siblings and her mother moved several times.|$|E
5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from <b>alcoholism,</b> went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat <b>alcoholism,</b> and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. <b>Alcoholism</b> has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was very}} close to his mother, who died in 1759. His father's <b>alcoholism</b> worsened after her death, and the youth took on the {{responsibility}} of supporting his father and younger sister. His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness, was refused communion by his church, and eventually died in 1761.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in nearby Lockport, Illinois. He {{is one of five}} children; his father was an engineer, while his mother was a homemaker. Brooks' father {{struggled}} with <b>alcoholism</b> which inspired him to become straight edge from an early age. He attended Lockport Township High School.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, <b>alcoholism,</b> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. The use of acid-suppressing medications—such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers—is {{associated with an}} increased risk of pneumonia. The risk is also increased in old age.|$|E
5|$|Depressed by {{his lack}} of {{widespread}} appreciation and suffering from writer's block, Ochs did not record any further albums. He slipped deeper into depression and <b>alcoholism.</b> His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, BC. A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Eli Todd also viewed alcohol as the “prominent evil of the day”. On February 22, 1842, the Washington Society of Farmington was formed. They practiced total abstinence, and {{employed}} social pressure for temperance in Farmington. By 1847, 569 people {{were part of}} this society. This was a step forward as part of Dr. Eli Todd’s attack against <b>alcoholism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of <b>alcoholism,</b> as {{he did not want to}} do anything that could damage his brain.|$|E
