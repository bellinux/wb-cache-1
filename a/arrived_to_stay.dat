5|$|Coghlan {{was elected}} to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The {{following}} year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the anarchy in Zirid Ifriqiya (Tunisia) made it {{a target}} for the Norman kingdom in Sicily, who between 1134 and 1148 had taken control of Mahdia, Gabès, Sfax, and the island of Jerba, all of which served as centers for {{commerce}} and trade. The only strong Muslim power then in the Maghreb {{was that of the}} newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber Abd al-Mu'min. He responded with several military campaigns into the eastern Maghrib which absorbed the Hammaid and Zirid states, and removed the Christians. Thus in 1152 he first attacked and occupied Bougie (in eastern Algeria), ruled by the Sanhaja Hammadids. His armies next entered Zirid Ifriqiya, a disorganized territory, taking Tunis. His armies also besieged Mahdia, held by Normans of Sicily, compelling these Christians to negotiate their withdrawal in 1160. Yet Christian merchants, e.g., from Genoa and Pisa, had already <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Ifriqiya, so that such a foreign merchant presence (Italian and Aragonese) continued.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months into}} the year, Hone {{disappeared}} without a trace and upon his return, it was revealed he had illegally snuck a refugee into the country. Michael fired Hone but later welcomed {{him back to the}} clinic. Hone's nephew Manny (Albert Belz) <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Hone but got into trouble with gangs. Whilst defending his nephew, Hone punched a gang member and was shocked when Chris declared the man dead. Hone was arrested on a murder charge but was cleared and began to date his lawyer Caitlin Devereux (Sarah Smuts-Kennedy), who left her husband for him. After the trial in 1995, Hone and Caitlin decided to set up a clinic on the East Coast and the couple departed Ferndale with the assistance of Chris and Carmen (Theresa Healey). 13 years later, Hone returned to the hospital to audit the hospital under the supervision of Martha Riley (Jacque Drew). Chris and TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) soon came to realize that Hone was seriously mentally unstable following a series of murders and rapes in his clinic in Africa. Hone replaced Chris as the hospital's Chief Executive Officer but quickly tired of the job and began an affair with Tania Jeffries (Faye Smythe). However Hone soon came to realize his fragile mentality and broke it off with Tania and fled to Australia. In 2012 Chris told Henare Ngatai (George Henare) that the two had previously been introduced by Hone.|$|E

So he just ambled along as if he had all the time in the world, as indeed he had. He was feeling very good-natured, was Jimmy Skunk. And why shouldn't he? There was everything to make him feel good-natured. Summer had <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> On every side he heard glad voices. Bumble the Bee was humming a song. Best of all, Jimmy had found three beetles that very morning, and he knew that there were more if he could find them. So why shouldn't he feel good? ...|$|E

The site that was to be Camrose was about a day's journey from Wetaskiwin along the railroad, which made it a popular place on the route of pioneers. Soon businessmen and other settlers <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> The settlers came primarily from Scandinavian countries, such as Norway and Sweden, and many settlers also came from the United States.

5000|$|Historically, {{women in}} the West have usually worn their hair long. Although young girls, actresses and a few [...] "advanced" [...] or fashionable women had worn short hair even before World War I—for example in 1910 the French actress Polaire is {{described}} as having [...] "a shock of short, dark hair", a cut she adopted in the early 1890s—the style was not considered generally respectable until given impetus by the inconvenience of long hair to girls engaged in war work. English society beauty Lady Diana Cooper, who had had bobbed hair as a child, kept the style through her teenage years and continued in 1914 as an adult. [...] Renowned dancer and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle introduced her [...] "Castle bob" [...] to a receptive American audience in 1915, and by 1920 the style was rapidly becoming fashionable. Popularized by film star Mary Thurman in the early 1920s and by Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks {{in the mid to}} late 1920s, it was still seen as a somewhat shocking statement of independence in young women known as flappers, as older people were used to seeing girls wearing long dresses and heavy Edwardian-style hair. Hairdressers, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, were slow to realise that short styles for women had <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> and so barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to be shorn of hair that had taken many years to grow.|$|E

40|$|Beginning in 1989, Argentina {{committed}} {{itself to}} a wide-ranging program of utility privatization {{and the establishment of}} new regulatory regimes. Following the international best practice, the design of these regimes involved the creation of independent regulatory agencies and the delegation of important regulatory powers to these agencies. At the time these reforms were introduced, there was a reasonable amount of consensus that both privatization and the change in the locus of regulatory power were policy changes that had <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> Moreover, the expectation was that utility regulation would become more stable than in the past. In this thesis, however, it is demonstrated that these expectations were unfounded. Using deductive reasoning, it is proposed that although delegation to independent regulatory agencies is an important condition for developing stable regulatory policies, equally important for that purpose is ensuring that governments cannot easily reverse that delegation or manipulate its terms. It is also hypothesized that, in the case of Argentina, whether or not this second requirement can be satisfied depends on the legal instrument policy-makers use to define the key features of a regulatory regime. The final claim is that, given the country's institutional endowment, the way regulatory policy is defined has an important consequence. It is less likely to be reversed, and therefore be stable and predictable, if key features of the policy are defined in a statute, than if they are contained within other legal instruments that can be passed - and changed - unilaterally by the executive. To test these hypotheses, the thesis uses three case studies: telecommunications regulation between 1990 and 2001; electricity regulation between 1992 and 2001; and utility regulation - across sectors - between the passage of the Economic Emergency Law in January 2002 and April 2003...|$|E
40|$|A new {{paradigm}} has <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{in the concept}} of the digital advertising. Each time counts less what the brand says and more what the people is willing to say or do for the brand. Adictik plays with that concept and turns it around, basing itself on an aspect that other successful apps had forgotten, to put a logo of a brand to each photo that it is distributed by Internet. The Adictik app is thought so that the user could be the main character of their own ads. The main functionality consists in that the user could compete with other users to demonstrate which of them is the biggest fan of a brand. To determine which of the users is the biggest fan of a brand, the app allows you to see a ranking of each brand. This ranking depends on the number of shakas that the ads of a user have of a specific brand. Moreover Adictik allows the interaction between the users that take part of the platform, allowing them to comment the ads of the others, as well as to mention them to be notified like other apps do that are very trendy nowadays. Furthermore, Adictik is considered as an essential tool for the marketing and advertising professionals, as they can be inspired by the opinions of their own consumers and see which are the biggest claims of them. Adictik can offer multiple metrics that can be very interesting for the brands. For instance the age range of their advertisers as well as the list of the biggest fans to give them a possible reward because the users are doing free advertising to that brand. The project is focused on the performance of a new Back-end for that app. For doing that the company define one essential condition that must be fulfilled to do the project. The enterprise rules that the app must be developed inside the platform that Google offers known as Google Cloud Platform. Through this document is made the emphasis on the benefits that the platform contributes {{to the development of the}} app as well as all the modules that offers you to save all the information...|$|E
