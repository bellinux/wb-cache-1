25|$|The cult comedy Irony of Fate (also Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!) {{is set in}} Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet city planning. The 1985 film White Nights {{received}} considerable Western {{attention for}} having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes {{at a time when}} filming in the Soviet Union by Western production companies was generally unheard of. Other movies include GoldenEye (1995), Midnight in Saint Petersburg (1996), Brother (1997) and Tamil romantic thriller film-Dhaam Dhoom (2008). Onegin (1999) is based on the Pushkin poem and showcases many tourist attractions. In addition, the Russian romantic comedy, Piter FM, intricately showcases the cityscape, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were a main character in the film.|$|E

500|$|In [...] A Child of Our Time Tippett was, in Kemp's view, wholly {{successful}} in integrating {{the language of}} the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the Hall Johnson Choir, which provided him with [...] a [...] model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals. [...] Thus, Kemp believes, the fourth spiritual [...] "O by and by" [...] sounds <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been composed by Tippett. [...] The composer's instructions in the score specify that [...] "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung.|$|E

500|$|Hot Press {{called it}} an [...] "obligatory ballad" [...] which portrays Jackon's musicality, {{showcasing}} her [...] "versatility and mastery of a bewildering array of styles." [...] Spence D. of IGN praised the single, calling it [...] "'70s retro mode" [...] and a perfect homage to the era of mainstream excess. The review added, [...] "It's squeaky and clean sounding in a sugary, fluff kind of way, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were a song recorded by Janet years ago and recently rediscovered. And you know what? It's cool because of that." [...] Aaron Foley of MLive considered it Jackson's fourth most underrated single, calling it among [...] "the fruits from that era that don't get the respect they deserve". Foley added, that after Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, [...] "I Want You" [...] "got lost in the wash. The starry-eyed, Motown-inspired ballad had Janet vulnerable and lovesick, boo hooing for her lover's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas {{about what to do with}} it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 2006 Women in Docs issued {{their second}} studio album, Red Wine and Postcards, which was {{produced}} and engineered by Middleton. Middleton also supplied guitar, keyboards and backing vocals. Clayton Ford of The Dwarf website noted the [...] "country tinged contemporary folk rock" [...] {{of the album}} with [...] "ales of life, loss and being are delicately layered". Mediasearch's Chanel Bartolo felt the album was [...] "amazing. Each song feels alive, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has an individual soul. There is heart in each word and each melody".|$|E

500|$|Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{deemed the}} track [...] "soulful balladry" [...] and felt it showcased that Sheeran [...] "can slip {{smoothly}} through the gears" [...] on the album. Lipshutz described his singing as being [...] "restrained" [...] over [...] "hesitant" [...] acoustic guitar strum before the [...] "arena drums kick in". Paul Cantor of Vibe picked [...] "Photograph" [...] {{as one of}} the standouts from the album, and noted that the song's [...] "brooding arrangement is an emotional roller coaster". Kitty Empire of The Observer called [...] "Photograph" [...] a [...] "swelling ballad", and suggested that Sheeran's writing was [...] "particularly calculated". In his review for MusicOMH, John Murphy also felt that [...] "Photograph" [...] was [...] "calculated and a bit cynical, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> been written specifically as a soundtrack to a particularly emotional scene in a US television series".|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the autopsy}} {{revealed}} no human flesh in Eugene's stomach, {{a number of}} undigested pills were discovered {{that have not been}} identified. [...] Although police sources had speculated that the street drug [...] "bath salts" [...] might have been involved, preliminary toxicology reports were positive only for the presence of cannabis. Authorities did not necessarily find the negative results conclusive; Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti expressed a belief that some new drug not yet tested for played a role; nationally noted toxicologist Barry Logan said Eugene's behavior was consistent with [...] "bath salts" [...] and that toxicologists [...] "are not testing for everything that may be out there"; and the director of toxicology at the University of Florida, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, said, [...] "We are not incompetent...We have the tools, we have the sophistication and know-how. But the field is evolving so rapidly it is hard for us to keep track. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is a race we can never win." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview with The Memphis Press Scimitar, Elvis himself was open about the close relationship to his mother. [...] "She was the number-one girl in his life, {{and he was}} dedicating his career to her." [...] Throughout her life, [...] "the son would call her by pet names," [...] and they communicated by baby talk. Presley even shared his mother's bed [...] "up until Elvis was a young teen," [...] simply because the family was so extremely poor that they couldn't afford the luxury of two beds. According to Elaine Dundy, [...] "it was agony for her to leave her child even for a moment with anyone else, to let anyone else touch Elvis." [...] Presley himself said, [...] "My mama never let me out of her sight. I couldn't {{go down to the}} creek with the other kids." [...] His father, Vernon Presley, talked about Elvis's close relationship to his mother [...] "after his son became famous, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were a source of wonder that anyone could be that close." ...|$|E

60|$|During {{subsequent}} years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my experiments, and my book on 'Insectivorous Plants' {{was published}} in July 1875--that is, sixteen years after my first observations.

The fact that a plant should secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a remarkable discovery.|$|R

500|$|Like other baboons, {{the olive}} baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. In fact, {{along with the}} muzzle, the animal's tail (...) and four-legged gait can make baboons seem very canine.
