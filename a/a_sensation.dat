50|$|Dysesthesia {{should not}} be {{confused}} with anesthesia or hypoesthesia, which refer to <b>a</b> loss of <b>sensation,</b> or paresthesia which refers to <b>a</b> distorted <b>sensation.</b> Dysesthesia is distinct in that it can, but not necessarily, refer to spontaneous sensations in the absence of stimuli. In the case of <b>an</b> evoked dysesthetic <b>sensation,</b> such as by the touch of clothing, the sensation is characterized not simply by an exaggeration of the feeling, but rather by <b>a</b> completely inappropriate <b>sensation</b> such as burning.|$|R

5|$|In 1991, the push-up Wonderbra became <b>a</b> <b>sensation</b> in the UK, {{although}} it had been sold there since 1964 under license by the Gossard division of Courtaulds Textiles.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether specific temporal lobe simple partial seizures (SPSs) {{are associated with}} an abnormal amygdala T- 2 (AT(2)) ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with intractable unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). AT(2) relaxation time mapping is a sensitive method {{for the detection of}} abnormal tissue in the amygdala in patients with refractory TLE. The relation between an abnormal AT(2) in the epileptic temporal lobe and amygdala seizure onset has not been established. Methods: Fifty patients with intractable unilateral TLE and concordant data during presurgical evaluation were included. Patients with a foreign-tissue lesion on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were excluded. All had AT(2) mapping. Fifteen types of SPSs were ascertained prospectively, systematically, and blinded to the results of AT(2) mapping. The SPSs of patients with a normal AT(2) (n = 25) were compared with those of patients with an abnormal AT(2) ipsilateral to the seizure focus (n = 25). Results: The group of patients with an abnormal AT(2) reported a median of six types of SPSs (range 1 - 11), in comparison with a median of three types of SPSs (range, 0 - 7) for the group with a normal AT(2) (p < 0. 01). Deja vu, <b>a</b> warm <b>sensation,</b> <b>an</b> indescribable strange <b>sensation,</b> <b>a</b> cephalic <b>sensation,</b> and fear were associated with an abnormal AT(2). The combination of deja vu, <b>a</b> cephalic <b>sensation,</b> <b>a</b> warm <b>sensation,</b> <b>a</b> gustatory hallucination, and <b>an</b> indescribable strange <b>sensation</b> discriminated best, between the 25 patients with a normal and the 25 patients with an abnormal AT(2.) Conclusions: A high number and the types of different SPSs provide clinical evidence for early involvement of the amygdala during seizures in patients with refractory unilateral TLE and an abnormal AT(2) in the epileptic temporal lobe...|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans.

5|$|At a {{rehearsal}} {{for one of}} these entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and <b>A</b> <b>Sensation</b> Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E

5|$|Disraeli left {{much of the}} {{detailed}} work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli <b>a</b> <b>sensation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel <b>a</b> <b>sensation,</b> which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing <b>a</b> <b>sensation</b> of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son – which {{at the time of their}} original production all caused <b>a</b> <b>sensation</b> among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused <b>a</b> <b>sensation,</b> sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused <b>a</b> <b>sensation.</b> However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused <b>a</b> <b>sensation</b> in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E
