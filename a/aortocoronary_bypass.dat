When the degree of coronary stenosis exceeded 80 % narrowing, poststenotic pressure decreased rapidly and hyperemic response appeared. In patients with comparable LAD stenosis a close correlation was found between basal graft flow and anterior wall motion (r = 0, 91).

40|$|Vascular injury during <b>aortocoronary</b> vein <b>bypass</b> graft {{surgery and}} {{arterial}} angioplasty initiates platelet thrombus deposition and mandates antithrombotic therapy, starting before the procedures to maximize protection against occlusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. To {{gain insight}} into the {{mechanism}} of stenting in humans and its short- and long-term implications, we studied the vascular wall of saphenous vein <b>aortocoronary</b> <b>bypass</b> grafts after implantation of the Wallstent. BACKGROUND. The implantation of a stent in <b>aortocoronary</b> <b>bypass</b> grafts may provide an alternative solution for revascularization in patients who are poor candidates for reoperation. Because human histopathologic findings after stenting with the Wallstent have not previously been described in detail, we examined graft segments that were surgically retrieved from 10 patients (21 stents) at 3 days to 10 months after implantation of the stent. METHODS. The grafts were examined {{by a combination of}} the following techniques: light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS. Early observations revealed that large amounts of platelets and leukocytes adhered to the stent wires during the first few days. At 3 months, the wires were embedded in a layered new intimal thickening, consisting of smooth muscle cells in a collagenous matrix. In addition, foam cells were abundant near the wires. Extracellular lipids and cholesterol crystals were found after 6 months. Smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix formed the predominant component of restenosis. This new intimal thickening was lined with endothelium, in some cases showing defect intercellular junctions and abnormal adherence of leukocytes and platelets as late as 10 months after implantation.

Patients with complete revascularization showed a significantly greater improvement in cardiac output postoperatively than did those with incomplete revascularization (26 versus 6 %, p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Among {{a series}} of 109 {{patients}} who underwent <b>aortocoronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> reoperation and received a total of 168 grafts, atherosclerosis was found in 29 saphenous vein grafts. Specimens were obtained at reoperation in 25 patients and at postmortem examination in four. Plaques were found from 3 months to 6 years after operation. The plaques often were combined with old or recent mural thrombi, intimal fibroses, or thickened intima associated with intramural hematomas. Clinical findings did not correlate with risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. In a well-functioning graft with adequate flow, cellular proliferation generally reflects an adjustment of the venous wall to a higher pressure. Such a vessel retains elastic properties of pulsating structures. In the specimens studied, intimal fibrosis associated with plaques was always poorly cellular, causing the grafts to become rigid. This resulted in irregular flow and, in some patients, dissection. The possible pathogenesis of atheromatosis in vein grafts may include the usual mechanisms of atherogenesis and atheromatous transformation of thrombi.
