5|$|A {{number of}} lives of Edward {{were written in}} the centuries {{following}} his death {{in which he was}} portrayed as a martyr, generally seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> the Queen Dowager Ælfthryth, mother of Æthelred. He is today recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Anglican Communion.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E

5|$|After his career, Washington {{has complained}} of {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way {{as a result of}} it. Washington told The New York Times that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.|$|E

His first known victim, 70-year-old Eva Lyons, lived at Keswick Close in the town. Shipman had initially been charged with 15 murders committed around Hyde, Greater Manchester, between 1995 and 1998 when he went on trial in late 1999, but Lyons was only identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> Shipman when the inquiry into his crimes was completed in July 2002 by Dame Janet Smith.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E
25|$|A {{villager}} (Vichare) {{brings his}} 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) {{to a doctor}} in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes.

A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer.
