5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
25|$|After twice proving {{its ability}} to fly combat {{missions}} from Missouri, the wing stepped up efforts to deploy the B-2 from forward locations. By late 2002, the Air Force had completed special shelters for the aircraft at Diego Garcia. The shelters provided a controlled climate similar to the facilities at Whiteman for specialized work on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> {{in order to maintain}} its stealth characteristics. This ability to sustain operations from a forward location added a new dimension of flexibility to potential air campaigns.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical rubbing of {{a heated}} surface with molten solder {{can be used}} for coating the surface. Both {{surfaces}} to be joined can be prepared this way, then placed together and reheated. This technique was formerly used to repair small damages on aluminium <b>aircraft</b> <b>skins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
25|$|Metallurgist Terry Heaslip of the Canadian company Accident Investigation and Research Inc. {{examined}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> from the tail and found signs of overheating, specifically that the skin had been repeatedly flexed, through a {{phenomenon known as}} flutter. This caused investigators to further scrutinize {{the tail of the}} aircraft. Furthermore, the investigation team found that the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), which was in the tail, generated heat which melted certain plastic parts, indicating that the APU was operating during the flight even though it normally would not be. The mechanic who had inspected the aircraft {{on the day of the}} accident flight told the investigators that one of the aircraft's two main generators had failed and that he was not able to repair the faulty generator. The investigators discovered that the pilots had noted in the flight log that they operated the APU during the flight, since two power sources are required for flight. They also discovered that the front APU mount was broken, which allowed it to vibrate excessively.|$|E

50|$|Fenestron and FANTAIL are {{trademarks}} for a ducted fan mounted {{at the end}} of the tail boom of the helicopter and used in place of a tail rotor. Ducted fans have between eight and eighteen blades arranged with irregular spacing so that the noise is distributed over different frequencies. The housing is integral with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> and allows a high rotational speed; therefore, a ducted fan can have a smaller size than a conventional tail rotor.|$|E
50|$|The Rearwin Junior was a sport {{aircraft}} {{produced in}} the United States by Rearwin Airplanes Inc. in the early 1930s. It was a conventional, high-wing monoplane with two seats in tandem in an open cockpit and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. An optional enclosed canopy was available. The wings were of wooden construction while the fuselage and empennage were built from welded steel tube, with the whole <b>aircraft</b> <b>skinned</b> in fabric.|$|R
5000|$|At speeds below {{critical}} mach, one of {{the primary}} forms of drag is skin friction. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>skin.</b> To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or [...] "wetted surface". One solution to this problem is constructing an [...] "egg shaped" [...] fuselage, for example as used on the home-built Questair Venture.|$|R
5|$|What may be {{the most}} {{originally}} restored Spitfire in the world is maintained at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida.

The {{first attempt to}} fly, in May 1911, failed. The reason for failure was that {{a part of the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> burned. On September 25, 1911 in Warsaw, Michał Scipio del Campio successfully flew the aircraft for a distance of about 15-20 kilometers in 15 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|DGE02: APHEI {{cartridge}} weighs between 175 and 188 g. At 1000 m it {{is quoted}} as having a 90 percent chance {{of being able to}} penetrate 15 mm of armour plate set at 30°. At 300 m after penetrating a 2 mm soft steel plate (representing an <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin)</b> it can further penetrate a 1.2 mm thick steel plate producing 20 fragments. Upon explosion between 75 and 95 incendiary pieces are formed which have an 80% chance of igniting aviation fuel.|$|E
5000|$|For {{metallic}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>skin</b> structures, {{etched foil}} resistive heating circuits have been bonded {{to the inside}} surface of skins. This approach holds the potential of enabling a lower overall power requirement than the embedded circuit approach due to its ability to operate at significantly higher power densities. [...] The Thermawing is an electrical ice protection system for general aviation. ThermaWing uses a flexible, electrically conductive, graphite foil attached to a wing's leading edge. Electric heaters heat the foil and melt the ice.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{transformer}} coupled stubs {{also provides}} improved protection for 1553 terminals against lightning strikes. Isolation {{is even more}} critical in new composite <b>aircraft</b> where the <b>skin</b> of the <b>aircraft</b> no long provides an inherent Faraday shield {{as was the case}} with aluminum <b>skinned</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
500|$|An American version, [...] "Yehudi", using lamps {{mounted in}} the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, was trialled in B-24 Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945. By {{directing}} the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>skin),</b> the system provided effective counter-illumination camouflage with an affordable use of energy, more like that of marine animals than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. But the system never entered active service, as radar became the principal means of detecting aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|More modern infra-red guided {{missiles}} {{can detect}} {{the heat of}} an <b>aircraft's</b> <b>skin,</b> warmed by the friction of airflow, {{in addition to the}} fainter heat signature of the engine when the aircraft is seen from the side or head-on. This, combined with greater maneuverability, gives them an [...] "all-aspect" [...] capability, and an attacking aircraft no longer had to be behind its target to fire. Although launching from behind the target increases the probability of a hit, the launching aircraft usually has to be closer to the target in such a tail-chase engagement.|$|R
