25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|During the {{recording}} of the album, short videos were posted to the band's YouTube profile. These videos documented the work {{going on in the}} studio, including street interviews where New Orleans locals were shown samples of the album (which couldn't be heard in the video), recording their reactions.

25|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{destruction}} of the Baghdad bureau of Al Jazeera, a U.S. tank fired a HEAT round <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military later said was a suspected Iraqi forward artillery observer. Due to what the U.S. states was a communications error, the tank fired at the Palestine Hotel, where approximately 100 international reporters in Baghdad were based, instead of the correct building, killing two journalists, Taras Protsyuk of Reuters and Jose Couso of the Spanish network Telecinco and wounding three other correspondents.|$|E

It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E

25|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning, and was derived from the 14th century Native American religion, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the Mississippi delta area, {{but it was also a}} stab <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> band viewed was the centralisation of power in Southern England (including that of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a North-South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and Aki Nawaz Qureshi (drums); they performed their first show at the Queen's Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock (then known as positive-punk), they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting {{the part of a}} nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." [...] Seiderman replied, [...] "You'd be surprised <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?" ...|$|E
500|$|The lyric to [...] "Photograph" [...] is centred around lost love, {{with the}} singer having {{only a single}} picture by which to {{remember}} his absent lover. The eponymous photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that [...] "you're not coming back any more". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an [...] "unusual" [...] aspect in the lyrics' [...] "absence of any hope that love might be rekindled". Starr expresses resignation <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future holds, in the lines [...] "Now you're expecting me to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to".|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were highlighted}} positively. Kasavin {{was impressed with}} the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the [...] "excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look." [...] Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a [...] "stunning look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> 360 hardware is capable of", but also admitted that the animation [...] "is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness". IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny. The game's audio was said to feature [...] "heavy-hitting weapon effects [...] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms".|$|E
500|$|In another review at the SF Site, Greg L. Johnson {{wrote that}} while City at the End of Time {{provides}} plenty of [...] "wonder, awe, {{and a sense}} of humanity {{in the face of an}} implacable universe", he feels that Bear does not quite succeed with this ambitious story of the fate of reality and the universe at large. Johnson described it as [...] "an immensely complicated story" [...] that unfolds by means of [...] "hints and allusions". He said that even the book's ending only hints <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> gathered role players had achieved. Johnson wrote that while Bear's depictions of events on a grand scale, like the decay of Seattle, are good, his portrayal of the key players against this backdrop is not as strong.|$|E

500|$|MDOT has {{indicated}} {{that it has not}} requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a [...] "spur" [...] from US41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, [...] "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> land uses are and where this [...] would push through." ...|$|E

However, Damar (Casey Biggs), {{the leader of the}} Cardassian Union is concerned <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> new alliance might bring and wants to side with the Federation; he releases Ezri and Worf and sets them free to take a message back to Deep Space Nine to seek aid. Worf discusses the actions of the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron (Robert O'Reilly), with Ezri in [...] "Tacking into the Wind". This results in Worf confronting the Chancellor and slaying him, ushering in General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) as the new leader of the Klingons. In the series finale, [...] "What You Leave Behind", Ezri and Bashir reveal their feelings for one another, and later after the fall of Cardassia Prime and the surrender of the Dominion, they discuss their future together.|$|E
500|$|The images {{also had}} a {{profound}} effect in Birmingham. [...] Despite decades of disagreements, when the photos were released, [...] "the black community was instantaneously consolidated behind King", according to David Vann, who would later serve as mayor of Birmingham. [...] Horrified <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Birmingham police were doing to protect segregation, New York Senator Jacob K. Javits declared, [...] "the country won't tolerate it", and pressed Congress to pass a civil rights bill. Similar reactions were reported by Kentucky Senator Sherman Cooper, and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse, who compared Birmingham to South Africa under apartheid. A New York Times editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police [...] "a national disgrace." [...] The Washington Post editorialized, [...] "The spectacle in Birmingham... must excite the sympathy {{of the rest of the}} country for the decent, just, and reasonable citizens of the community, who have so recently demonstrated at the polls their lack of support for the very policies that have produced the Birmingham riots. The authorities who tried, by these brutal means, to stop the freedom marchers do not speak or act in the name of the enlightened people of the city." [...] President Kennedy sent Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall to Birmingham to help negotiate a truce. [...] Marshall faced a stalemate when merchants and protest organizers refused to budge.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian WÃ¥hlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
