5|$|After her corps was disbanded in 1942, she {{was sent}} to Jiangxi Province to reclaim {{abandoned}} farmland where war orphans could work, feed themselves and receive education. Just before the Japanese surrendered, they launched <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attack in July 1945 in Jiangxi, threatening her community.|$|E
5|$|Dick {{recognized}} that the bloodletting and other treatments were failing, and he proposed performing an emergency tracheotomy as <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> effort to save Washington's life. Few American doctors were then familiar with this procedure {{and the other two}} doctors disapproved.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets evade predators {{by living}} below ground, and vigorously {{burrowing}} if disturbed at the surface. As <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> defence, they eject a foul-smelling brown liquid from their anal glands when captured; {{they can also}} bite.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1918, the German Army {{launched}} its Spring Offensive in <b>a</b> <b>last-ditched</b> {{effort to win}} the war, unleashing 63 divisions over a [...] front. As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme. The offensive lasted {{for the next five}} months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide. By late May the Germans had pushed to within [...] of Paris. During this time the Australians fought at Dernancourt, Morlancourt, Villers-Bretonneux, Hangard Wood, Hazebrouck, and Hamel. At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps, Monash, successfully used combined arms—including aircraft, artillery and armour—in an attack for the first time.|$|R
50|$|But Birmingham fell to a 1-0 {{defeat at}} home to Everton the {{following}} week. Thomas Gravesen scored a 69th-minute penalty after Izzet handled a shot on the goalline. Referee Rob Styles sent Izzet off and awarded Everton the spot-kick. Heskey was denied a leveller by <b>a</b> great <b>last-ditch</b> block by Tony Hibbert and Yorke wasted a late chance from ten yards.|$|R
50|$|The {{collapse}} of one side's defense {{marks the beginning}} of the end game. Once a player has broken through the enemy lines, the opponent's king can be easily trapped by its own pieces. <b>A</b> common <b>last-ditch</b> defensive tactic is to open the pawn line to allow the king to escape. Kings are more difficult to checkmate in the open, especially if the opponent does not have many ranged pieces in play.|$|R
5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece {{in a desperate attempt}} to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius in the battle of Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E
5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's militia), which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> militia founded on 18 October 1944. Poorly equipped and trained, the men were sent to fight on the eastern front, where nearly 175,000 of them were killed without having any discernible impact on the Soviet advance.|$|E
5|$|Independence Day is a 1996 American {{science fiction}} action film {{directed}} and co-written by Roland Emmerich. The film focuses on disparate {{groups of people}} who converge in the Nevada desert {{in the aftermath of}} a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> counterattack on July 4 – Independence Day in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|At {{some point}} during Neary's run but before the market crash, Marvel UK was running low on money. They {{requested}} an emergency meeting with Marvel Entertainment executives Bill Bevin and Terry Stewart to approve <b>a</b> £1m <b>last-ditch</b> strategy. While they got the money, writer Sean Howe would later be told that Bevin was livid about being called to London for a mere one million, asking [...] "why are you wasting my time?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Glen Buckie, now a quiet {{backwater}} on {{the south}} side of Balquhidder Glen was the scene of one of the last acts of the 1745 Jacobite rising. Dr Archibald [...] "Archie" [...] Cameron of Locheil had returned to Scotland in the early 1750s hoping to raise support for <b>a</b> possible <b>last-ditch</b> coup against George II. [...] He was captured in the glen, and was later hanged in London, the last Jacobite to be executed for treason.|$|R
5000|$|Bell {{was elected}} as a Whig to the 29th Congress in November, 1844. He {{did not seek}} reelection and served a single term in the House, March 4, 1845 [...] - [...] March 4, 1847. He was the Kentucky Secretary of State in 1849, and was sent by Kentucky as a {{commissioner}} to the Peace Conference held in Washington, D.C. in February 1861 in <b>an</b> unsuccessful <b>last-ditch</b> effort to stave off what became the American Civil War.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> {{effort to}} avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|As more {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Hudong-ni on 30 November, the garrisons attempted {{to recapture the}} East Hill. All efforts failed despite {{the destruction of a}} Chinese company. When darkness settled, the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1,500 soldiers in <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attempt to capture Hagaru-ri. The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces, with only the defences around the East Hill giving way. As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill, they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company.|$|E
25|$|Bunker {{remained}} {{in command of}} the coastal artillery in Manilla Bay during the Battle of Corregidor. On May 5, 1942, the battle came to an end when the half-starved U.S. forces commanded by Gen. Wainwright surrendered after <b>an</b> heroic <b>last-ditch</b> stand. Bunker, at age 61, became a prisoner of war and died of starvation and disease in a Japanese prison camp at Karenko, Taiwan. Fellow prisoners recalled that Bunker wasted away from 220 pounds down to 150 pounds prior to his death.|$|R
5000|$|Commando {{attacks have}} failed {{and after a}} {{bombardment}} by B-24 Liberator bombers fails to destroy the guns, Captain James Jensen RN, Chief of Operations for SOE in Cairo, decides to launch <b>a</b> desperate <b>last-ditch</b> attempt which he has already planned in case the bombing is unsuccessful. He has drawn together a team of specialist saboteurs to infiltrate the island via the [...] "unclimbable" [...] south cliff {{and get into the}} fortress to destroy the guns. They have less than one week.|$|R
50|$|Both the House of Representatives and the Senate {{rejected}} Crittenden's proposal.

5|$|Following the Wehrmacht's {{victory at}} Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided to launch <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> {{offensive}} in the West aiming {{to catch the}} Anglosphere forces by surprise, {{with the objective of}} retaking Antwerp, striking the seam between the British and Americans that leads to political as well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly the political leadership) could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|In August, a bill {{authorizing the}} Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts {{was passed by}} the Chamber of Deputies seventy-two to thirteen. Three months later, it was {{defeated}} in the Senate after they approved an arbitration treaty and the government made <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed. The Brazilian government declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money (£14,000,000) could be better spent {{in other areas of the}} government.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944, the German army, {{under the}} command of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France. On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during {{the early stages of the}} ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during the worst winter Europe had seen in years. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front to a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.|$|E
50|$|In The Two Swords, Obould's horde has {{pressed the}} Companions {{to the very}} gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch <b>a</b> desperate, <b>last-ditch</b> effort to push the orcs back. A desperate rescue attempt succeeds, with Drizzt and Innovindil rescuing the latter's pegasus, which Obould had {{captured}} and chained as a trophy, and Drizzt is unexpectedly reunited with the Companions that he long thought dead. The only major plot line to be tied up in this novel {{is the question of}} what Drizzt will do about his relationship with Catti-brie.|$|R
5000|$|Mahoney, Schtulman, and Lassard get {{together}} in <b>an</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attempt {{to stop the}} gang. They send in Mahoney undercover to infiltrate the gang. Lassard and Schtulman wire him, using duct tape and a radio microphone. Under the guise of [...] "Jughead," [...] formerly of the gang [...] "The Archies", {{he is able to}} infiltrate the gang and find out both their hiding spot and the name of their leader. However, his cover is blown after the microphone cuts into a radio ad, which leads to Captain Lassard calling every man to the location. The officers arrive, but are stopped by Mauser. Mauser attempts to conduct a raid, but Fackler accidentally bumps him in an air duct and pushes him inside, which leads to Mauser being captured by Zed and his gang. The officers stage their own raid and manage to overpower and arrest the gang. Zed attempts to escape with Mahoney, but Lassard blocks his escape and prepares to shoot Zed. However, Mahoney punches Zed down a flight of stairs, where Hooks arrests him. It's then revealed that Lassard's gun wasn't loaded, as he [...] "hasn't carried live ammo since '73". Lassard is later reinstated as captain, as are Mahoney and Schtulman on the force, while Mauser demoted back to lieutenant for nearly blowing Lassard's raid.|$|R
25|$|After {{defeating}} Kennedy in 24 of 34 primaries, Carter {{entered the}} party's convention in New York in August with 60 {{percent of the}} delegates pledged {{to him on the}} first ballot. Still, Kennedy refused to drop out. At the convention, after <b>a</b> futile <b>last-ditch</b> attempt by Kennedy to alter the rules to free delegates from their first-ballot pledges, Carter was renominated with 2,129 votes to 1,146 for Kennedy. Vice President Walter Mondale was also renominated. In his acceptance speech, Carter warned that Reagan's conservatism posed a threat to world peace and progressive social welfare programs from the New Deal to the Great Society.|$|R
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to save the}} Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign to preserve the pier in situ was launched. Ahead of the closure, members of the public, environmentalists, and some lawmakers arrived to tie blue ribbons to indicate their desire to preserve the harbour. On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attempt to urge the Government to reconsider: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected.|$|E
50|$|In the Warcraft franchise, {{particularly}} as {{featured in the}} MMORPG World of Warcraft, gnomes are a race of beings separate from but allied to dwarves and humans, with whom they share the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. Crafty, intelligent, and smaller than their dwarven brethren, gnomes are one of two races in Azeroth regarded as technologically savvy. It is suggested in lore that the gnomes originally were mechanical creations {{that at some point}} became organic lifeforms. In World of Warcraft, gnomes are an exile race, having irradiated their home city of Gnomeregan in <b>an</b> unsuccessful <b>last-ditch</b> effort to drive out marauding foes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Percy's Song" [...] is sung {{from the}} point of view of a man who visits a judge in <b>a</b> futile, <b>last-ditch</b> attempt to save his friend from a severe prison sentence. It is based on a tune taken from [...] "The Wind and the Rain", a song {{introduced}} to Dylan by Paul Clayton. [...] "'Percy's Song', along with ... 'Seven Curses' and 'Moonshine Blues', showed that Dylan's command of traditional themes, housed in traditional melodies, remained undiminished by the topicality of other efforts", writes Heylin. Fairport Convention recorded their own celebrated rendition of [...] "Percy's Song" [...] on their critically acclaimed third album, Unhalfbricking.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, {{a nearly}} broke {{businessman}} decided to invest his last {{money in a}} racing horse, in <b>an</b> all-or-nothing <b>last-ditch</b> effort. He called this horse Kings' Legend, after the above legend. The horse won the race, and the businessman's luck {{changed for the better}} again. In honor of the three kings and their legend, he had a mansion built at the site where the last remaining treasure was believed to be buried. He named the mansion Kings' Legend as well. Upon his death in the late nineteenth century, the mansion was bought by the Ratcliff family.|$|R
5|$|Working {{with his}} new partner Emma Hollis (Klea Scott), Black finds himself {{struggling}} to combat the far-reaching influence of the Millennium Group. Due to {{the workings of the}} Group, Black is framed for the death of a fellow agent, prompting his resignation from the FBI and fleeing Washington D.C. with Jordan; likewise, Hollis is convinced to abandon Black and work with the Group. Several months later, Black is able to work with FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to foil <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> effort by the Group to bring {{about the end of the}} world; vindicated, he reunites with Jordan after the case.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
25|$|The game {{focuses on}} the troops of Delta Squad as they wield <b>a</b> desperate, <b>last-ditch</b> attempt to save the {{remaining}} human inhabitants of the fictional planet Sera from a relentless and genocidal subterranean enemy known as the Locust Horde.

50|$|The Beach Boys {{third and}} final album release of 1968, coming after Friends and {{released}} {{the same day as}} the quickly gathered material for The Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 3, Stack-o-Tracks was seen by many at the time as <b>a</b> desperate <b>last-ditch</b> effort by Capitol Records to try anything to sell Beach Boys material. The strategy backfired, however; issued at one of their lowest commercial ebbs in the U.S., Stack-o-Tracks became the first Beach Boys album to fail to reach the U.S. or UK charts. Until 1992's much-maligned Summer in Paradise, it would remain their only official release to have this distinction.|$|R
