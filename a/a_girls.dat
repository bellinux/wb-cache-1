5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now also have <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, {{that part of}} the building that contains the stalls, usually to the east of the central tower but sometimes extending under it, is called the choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from the nave of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from the nave and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. The nave of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually made of stone and is usually the oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E

25|$|As many {{municipalities}} of the Department Digne acquired schools {{well before the}} Jules Ferry laws.

25|$|When Summitt {{was in high}} school, {{her family}} moved to nearby Henrietta, so she could play {{basketball}} in Cheatham County because Clarksville did not have <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> team. From there, Summitt went to University of Tennessee at Martin where {{she was a member}} of Chi Omega Sorority and won All-American honors, playing for UT–Martin's first women's basketball coach, Nadine Gearin. In 1970, with the passage of Title IX still two years away, there were no athletic scholarships for women. Each of Summitt's brothers had gotten an athletic scholarship, but her parents had to pay her way to college. She later co-captained the United States women's national basketball team as a player at the inaugural women's tournament in the 1976 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. Eight years later in 1984, she coached the U.S. women's team to an Olympic gold medal, becoming the first U.S. Olympian to win a basketball medal and coach a medal-winning team.|$|E
25|$|The {{school was}} opened in 1863 {{as a school}} of boys housing 42 {{students}} its first year. In 1868 <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> section was operated in the main site but was separated and operated by the Sisters of St. Ann. They later on moved in 1882 so that construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway could take place. The students were mainly Stó:lō people and others from the Fraser Valley. The boys and girls lived separately, things made available for example dining hall, laundry, bakery and classrooms. There was emphasis on Catholic Catechism and academics and then a shift to agriculture and industrial vocations including woodworking, attending mass, ironing and sewing. Parents that were able to visit were allowed to visit and some camped around school area. Up until 1948 students were given permission to visit the city of Mission. Students on arrival at the school were assigned lockers, beds and dormitory. They were also checked for lice and given two sets of clothes to be worn and marked.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} facility is the Vale Stadium on Farnborough Road which hosts a grandstand, overlooking the main pitch {{which is then}} surrounded by several other grass pitches for football. The stadium is used by Castle Vale F.C., Castle Vale JKS F.C. and Paget Sports F.C., {{the result of an}} amalgamation of the now-defunct Paget Rangers F.C., who played their last match at the stadium on 23 April 2002, and Pinnacle Sports F.C.. Castle Vale F.C. is a more established football club than Castle Vale JKS F.C., although it has its roots in Kings Heath. They became Castle Vale F.C. following a series of name changes that reflected their change of ground. Castle Vale JKS F.C. was established in 1998 as a youth team on the estate and has now diversified into establishing an adult men's team and <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> team.

25|$|Not {{long before}} Operation Red Wings had occurred, {{relations}} with the Americans had improved in the Shuryek Valley and the greater Pech river region because of humanitarian work that had been occurring. Medical services had been extended, and <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> school was built at Nangalam. Gulab was aware of these developments and had introduced himself to the Marine commander at Nangalam, Matt Bartels, when he was visiting Matin. It was within this context that Gulab stumbled upon Luttrell and gave him sanctuary. The Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah, knew that the wounded man that he was tracking had {{to pass through the}} village of Salar Ban as he contoured downhill. Through intimidation Shah was able to ascertain which house sheltered the wounded man and demanded that he be turned over. But Shah couldn't risk a fight at that moment because he was outnumbered and other relatives and villagers would come to Gulab's aid. Luttrell was subsequently moved to different places until forces could arrive to extract him.|$|E
25|$|The Episcopal Church {{established}} {{other institutions}} in Davenport {{in the late}} 19th century that served the community into the 21st century, even though none of the institutions are supported by the church today. Bishop Perry announced plans for <b>a</b> <b>girls</b> school in 1883. The residence of Mrs. John L. Davies, which was named Cambria Place, {{was chosen as the}} location for the new school. On September 24, 1884, St. Katherine's Hall opened to both day and boarding students. In 1902 the Sisters of Mary took over the administration and teaching responsibilities at the school. In the years following the school expanded {{with the addition of a}} chapel and academic buildings. The Renwick mansion was added to the facility in 1907. In 1968 the school ended its boarding program and admitted boys. The name was changed to St. Katherine and St. Mark to reflect this change. In 1973, the school moved to the former home of Joseph Bettendorf in Bettendorf, Iowa, and in 1980 it amicably broke its ties with the Episcopal Church. In 2001, the school changed its name to Rivermont Collegiate.|$|E
