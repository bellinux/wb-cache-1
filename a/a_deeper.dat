5|$|M. c. cyaneus, the {{nominate}} subspecies {{described in}} 1782, is found throughout Tasmania. Birds are larger and {{darker than the}} mainland subspecies, with males having <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> azure blue coloration. Schodde in his 1982 review reclassified elizabethae and samueli under cyaneus.|$|E
5|$|M. c. elizabethae, {{endemic to}} King Island was {{described}} as a separate species elizabethae by Archibald James Campbell in 1901. Males have <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> blue colour than Tasmanian birds. King Island birds also have longer tarsi (lower legs).|$|E

5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> reddish orange skin {{on the head and}} a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} novelised by Nigel Kneale, {{his first book}} since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story {{collection}} Tomato Cain was published in 1949. The novelisation expanded on the backgrounds {{of many of the}} characters seen in the story, and added <b>a</b> <b>deeper,</b> more physical, relationship between Quatermass and Annie Morgan. It was this version of the story with which Kneale was most pleased.|$|E

Testing revealed that the addition of leading edge cuffs to the outboard wing prevented the aircraft from getting into <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> stall. The Piper Advanced Technologies PAT-1, N15PT, another canard-configured aircraft, also crashed in an accident attributed to <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> stall.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>deeper</b> analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
40|$|We {{implement}} two deep architectures for the acousticarticulatory inversion mapping problem: <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{neural network}} and <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> trajectory mixture density network. We {{find that in}} both cases, deep architectures produce more accurate predictions than shallow architectures {{and that this is}} due to the higher expressive capability of <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> model and not a consequence of adding more adjustable parameters. We also find that <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> trajectory mixture density network is able to obtain better inversion accuracies than smoothing the results of <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> neural network.

5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, to <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> level of sophistication. He {{was the first}} to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|Except {{those with}} an {{advertising}} livery, the trams are painted a light blue. The first series was delivered with <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> blue color than has been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation of the electrostatic properties of metal / semi - insulating GaAs contacts {{has been carried}} out for different surface potentials at different temperatures.

5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> draught.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> formation than usual, while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. This {{was so successful}} that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating {{that it may have}} had a more favourable climate), but the lack of pollen may be the product of <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> lake. Polylepis may have thrived in favourable salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena pollen is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> connection with nature. Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life.
