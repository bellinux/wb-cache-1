5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 April 1806, Rana Bahadur held a meeting at Tribhuvan Khawas's house with rest of the courtiers, during which he taunted and {{threatened}} to execute Sher Bahadur. At around 10pm, Sher Bahadur in desperation drew a sword and killed Rana Bahadur Shah before being cut down by nearby courtiers, Bam Shah and Bal Narsingh Kunwar, also allies of Bhimsen. The assassination of Rana Bahadur Shah triggered a great massacre in Bhandarkhal (a royal garden east of Kathmandu Durbar) and {{at the bank of}} Bishnumati river. That very night members of Sher Bahadur's faction – Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas, and Narsingh Gurung – and even King Prithvipal Sen of Palpa, who was under house arrest in Patan Durbar, were swiftly rounded up and killed in Bhandarkhal. Their dead bodies were not allowed funeral rites and were dragged and thrown by the banks of Bishnumati to be eaten by vultures and jackals. The next few days, all the sons of Sher Bahadur Shah, Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas and Narsingh Gurung, aged 2 to 15 were beheaded by the bank of Bishnumati; their wives and daughters were given to the untouchables, their body guards and servants were also put to death, and all their property seized. Bhimsen managed to kill everyone who did not agree with him or anyone who could potentially become <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the future. In this massacre that lasted for about two weeks, a total of ninety-three people (16 women and 77 men) lost their lives.|$|E

2500|$|In 1847, Mosby {{enrolled}} at Hampden–Sydney College, {{where his father}} was an alumnus. Unable {{to keep up with}} his mathematics class, Mosby left the college after two years. On October 3, 1850, he entered the University of Virginia, taking Classical Studies and joining the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union. He was far above average in Latin, Greek, and literature (all of which he enjoyed), but mathematics was still <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> In his third year a quarrel erupted between Mosby and a notorious bully, George R. Turpin, a tavern keeper's son who was robust and physically impressive. When Mosby heard from a friend that Turpin had insulted him, Mosby sent Turpin a letter asking for an explanation—one of the rituals in the code of honor to which Southern gentlemen adhered. Turpin became enraged and declared that on their next meeting, he would [...] "eat him up raw!" [...] Mosby decided he had to meet Turpin despite the risk; to run away would be dishonorable.|$|E

He later regretted this, saying: [...] "I never really came to grips with the music. I should have stuck with it. I've always felt that if I could hum it, I could play it. For me, that was good enough, but that attitude is bad." [...] Ryan recalled: [...] "Phil always had <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with reading.

In order to do that he embarked on his ten-play cycle which would present the African American experience to his people and to the world. “In Blackburn’s assessment, Wilson is a playwright-historian whose ‘memory embraces the Middle Passage, enslavement, torture, economic deprivation, pseudo-freedom, and human ability to endure’ ” (Snodgrass 157). One of his central concerns was the correct and accurate representation of the African-American experience. “The inability to suppress, control, manipulate, and right histories of race has repeatedly affected the social and cultural dynamics of African American life ” (Elam x). His contention was that only African –Americans should have the last word in accurately and completely depicting the African-American experience.
