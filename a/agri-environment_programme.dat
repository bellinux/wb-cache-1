40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} Macedonia’s {{backbone}} for centuries {{and has always}} {{played an important role}} in Macedonian society. By maintaining landscape and biodiversity through the ages, Macedonian farmers have been the true guardians of an important national treasure – biodiversity. They have been the invisible hand managing landscapes, agricultural habitats and enabling farm-linked biodiversity to provide a range of ecosystem services. Pollination; pest, disease, flood and fire regulation; preservation of genetic resources; and the provision of food, fibre, natural medicine, pharmaceuticals and appealing landscapes are only a few of these services. Agricultural biodiversity under threat Many of the Macedonian landscapes and habitats that are important for conservation have been created by centuries-old practices of extensive grazing and low-input small-scale cropping practices. There is a very strong inter-linkage between farming, biodiversity and maintenance of traditional agricultural landscapes. However, depopulation of farming communities and their ageing, together with the introduction of agricultural machinery and intensive animal husbandry in fertile plains has drastically decreased the number of livestock in marginal areas. Most of these are mountainous regions with poor soils, but with species-rich grassland and other valuable ecosystems. Macedonian agriculture has also become “less mobile”. Traditional pastoral grazing systems, flocks and shepherds are nowadays more a tourist attraction than a common sight. A reduction of livestock density results in less moving and grazing, leading to land abandonment and changes in land use. The area of farmland of high natural value and the mosaic of habitats for wildlife in Macedonia has been shrinking due to an invasion by shrubs and other pioneering vegetation. This process results in the growth of coarse vegetation, leads to the development of semi-woody species and eventually closed canopy forests. Such ecosystems have substantially lower biodiversity value than fragmented agricultural landscapes, notably natural grassland. They harbour less bird, butterfly and plant species than managed grassland. Enhanced natural succession also causes a higher risk of fire because the excess biomass is not subject to grazing pressure. If not adequately addressed, the problem of land abandonment and natural succession in Macedonia will cause irreversible damage. The expansion of intensive agriculture in the lowlands is another threat to agricultural biodiversity. Land drainage, removal of hedges and other field margins, usage of pesticides and fertilisers are leading to a decline in agricultural biodiversity and provision of related ecosystem services. <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> promise vs. farmers’ reality The EU has introduced <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> and payments to stop and to reverse these kinds of negative trends. In the accession process, Macedonia is required to design its own <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes,</b> compatible with the Common Agricultural Policy. These programmes encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. Agri-environment payments are an instrument through which society rewards farmers for the public goods and services they provide, as the market does not recognise their values. However, Macedonian farmers have to be aware of this opportunity and to be prepared for benefiting from <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> For various historical, socio-economic, administrative, and other reasons, in Macedonia – as in some other countries – the human and social capital for administering and implementing <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> is limited. The uptake in these programmes in Macedonia is likely to be slow and on a limited scale due to the following obstacles: 1. 	Farming in Macedonia, notably in high-nature-value areas is practiced predominantly by small-scale, (semi) -subsistence, elderly and poorly educated farmers. They have limited entrepreneurial skills, financial power and technical know-how. Besides, many operate in the most marginal areas (from an agriculturalist perspective) and under difficult weather conditions and socio-economic realities. 2. 	The majority of such farmers are outside of the mainstream economic and administrative systems. They produce mostly for themselves and their extended families, selling their surplus products locally for cash, without any receipts or VAT charged. They are not obliged to practice bookkeeping and are not subject to income tax. The farmland they use, especially grasslands – as well as their livestock is rarely included in the Land and other Registers. These farmers are the “outlaws” of the official systems and as such are not eligible for EU area-based support schemes such as agri-environment payments. Those few such farmers who would like to become a part of the official systems and register their land and livestock, face complicated, unresolved land ownership and land use issues – sometimes going back several generations. 3. 	Products (cheese, milk, “kashkaval”, salami, etc.) that are produced in a traditional way do not necessarily meet the respective national or newly harmonised EU sanitary, veterinary or hygiene standards, making their sale through mainstream marketing channels virtually impossible. 4. 	Agri-environment payments compensate for additional costs and/or income foregone associated with the implementation of the respective measures. But they do not fully take into account negative agricultural externalities and reward farmers for positive externalities by providing them an additional incentive – an extra, above the costs occurred and/or income foregone. 5. 	Very few Macedonian farmers have agricultural or education in nature conservation. A vast majority relies only on practical experience and tradition; and they are not sufficiently aware of the ecosystem services they provide and their value for society as a whole. For most of them farming is not their deliberate choice but an inevitable job – a survival strategy. Many of them are likely to perceive agri-environment as an externally imposed concept that has little to do with their harsh reality and their priorities. Environmental NGOs can help to remove barriers preventing a better uptake of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> The above-mentioned issues are serious obstacles for the enrolment in <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> However, examples from EU Member States facing similar problems, notably Romania, Bulgaria and some Mediterranean countries show that barriers preventing uptake in agri-environment schemes can be removed if a creative approach is applied and social consensus reached. Building farmers’ capacities by providing them various forms of technical and administrative assistance and by setting up an appropriate legislative framework, social/institutional structures and facilities can increase farmers’ participation in <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> The feasibility of establishing various forms and institutional settings for collective agri-environment schemes can be explored. In this case a group of small-scale farmers can jointly apply for agri-environment payments (e. g. by setting up a co-operative or through the help of the municipality, etc). Taking part in a collective agri-environment scheme would not only relieve individual farmers from administrative burdens. It is also likely to be more effective and more profitable. Moreover, in many cases, this might be the only way for small-scale farmers to benefit from agri-environment payments. Environmental NGOs can play a vital role in assisting both farmers and society to understand high-nature value farming and <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> Their members are often well educated, enthusiastic young experts who will potentially over time evolve into opinion leaders and/or decision makers. Environmental NGOs can act as catalysts between farmers, policy makers and society. By increasing understanding, informing and educating various stakeholders they can reinforce farmers’ position and create a win-win situation for all social groups. Environmental NGOs can work on informing both farmers and citizens why it is important to protect biodiversity and how this can benefit them. Protection of biodiversity can only succeed if all stakeholders actively understand and support the conservation vision and objectives set by <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> Policy makers should create an enabling environment for this to happen and NGOs can significantly influence them. However, as policy makers often tend to neglect the needs of small farmers – at the expense of “big producers” – environmental NGOs can act as their guardians and make policy makers and civil society more aware about the "hidden" values they provide. Society often tends to develop an attitude of underestimation towards people living in marginal rural areas. Many people – not only in Macedonia – still think that only “losers” choose to live in these areas, i. e. only those who are not “good” or “competent” enough to find their place elsewhere. The attitude that farming is an occupation chosen by those who are not capable or who are not able to do anything else still prevails today. However, those who have that kind of attitude tend to forget that their economic prosperity and welfare is also due to the hard work of those living in remote rural areas and providing the ecosystem services mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter. Environmental NGOs can lobby to put these kinds of issues higher on the political agenda. Through information dissemination, awareness raising, education, demonstration projects, campaigns, etc., they can enlighten citizens and policy makers about the importance of (agricultural) biodiversity and the ecosystem services provided by marginalised farmers. Besides, NGOs can also serve as watchdogs securing that legislation aiming at protecting agricultural biodiversity is put in place and enforced. Further, NGOs can build networks, coalitions and alliances of like-minded individuals and organizations. They can establish a forum of different yet commonly concerned actors and initiate dialogues across differing perspectives and players. The strengthening of social and human capital in order to ensure a smooth and large-scale uptake of agri-environment measures in Macedonia is a long-term and complex process. It requires understanding and co-operation between relevant stakeholders, a constant exchange of information and capacity building. (Small-scale) Macedonian farmers can continue providing the ecosystem services that are so vital to society only if society is willing to reward them for their hard and honest work. Environmental NGOs are there to help and facilitate that process. This very project has paved the road to a long-lasting partnership between Macedonian farmers, environmental NGOs and policy makers. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} rural {{development}} policy implementers and evaluators as users of European biodiversity data. It critically analyses the use of biodiversity data for measuring the impact of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> and related rural development funding, and highlights good practices {{from a range of}} countries. The examples show the possibilities for better targeting and evaluation of agricultural funding to biodiversity conservation if sufficient biodiversity data are available and are used in policy. However, many biodiversity datasets exist at the national or regional but are still not integrated in the RDP monitoring system and thus not accessible to evaluators, and many RDPs still feature only the obligatory EU-level indicators. It is important to differentiate between the need for standardised EU-level datasets {{that can be used for}} an overall assessment of the impact of the CAP, where there is still a huge data gap, and the national or regional programming level, where there are often existing data that are not being used for various reasons.

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen {{sustainable}} development {{emerging as a}} core concern of European Union (EU) policy. In order to consider how policies can contribute more positively to the goals of sustainable development, major EU policies must undergo an assessment of their potential economic, environmental and social impacts. Within the agri-environment sector, this {{is reflected in the}} increasing requirement for EU Members States to monitor and evaluate the socio-economic as well as the environmental and agricultural impacts of their <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes.</b> Whilst some research has looked at the more easily quantifiable economic impacts of agri-environment schemes (AES), there is a paucity of research exploring the social dimensions. In this paper, four areas where social impacts of AES can be assessed are suggested: namely impact on on-farm employment; income security; human capital through skills and training development; and social capital development through extension of knowledge networks and flows. These areas are explored in detail using the results of a survey of Environmental Stewardship schemes in England. The results show that the level of social benefit is differentiated by scheme and farm type. The more demanding Higher Level Stewardship schemes help to develop human capital and increase networks, and dairy farmers in particularly have extended their advisory networks in order to participate in AES. The paper concludes that through the exploration of the social impact of AES {{it may be possible to}} identify ways to more closely link social and environmental stewardship objectives and thereby contribute to sustainable agriculture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} panel {{regression}} analysis using county-level data {{to quantify the}} relative importance of competing forestry and agricultural policy incentives in explaining trends in private afforestation in Ireland. It concludes that an increase in the level of up front payments to planters is the most cost efficient way of increasing planting levels. The introduction of the Irish <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programme</b> REPS has contributed to a significant decline in the level of forestry planting and offset the recent increases in the level of forestry grants and premia. Several policy reforms to encourage forestry planting in Ireland are proposed, including greater integration of forestry with the REPS scheme and increasing the value of the initial payment which farmers receive. ...|$|E

Policy measures concerning area-based financial support for conversion to and continuation of organic farming, officially-recognized standards and support for market and regional development, advice and research are considered. This indicates that individual measures can also work against each other.

40|$|Abstract. Plantago lanceolata {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most {{valuable}} dicotyledonous pasture herbs found on meadows and pastures. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of Plantago lanceolata on yields and quality of twice harvested semi-natural meadow swards utilized according to <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programme</b> guidelines (P 10 b variant), as well as on pastures established using mixtures containing Plantago lanceolata. On studied meadows, presence of Plantago lanceolata in amounts exceeding 3 % of the total yield could be seen as an indicator of negative changes in humidity and tropism, causing a reduction in dry mass yields and the deterioration of sward quality after the first harvest. Meanwhile, yields from pastures containing Plantago lanceolata were almost four times higher. Furthermore, Plantago lanceolata ingested by cows contained more protein, sugars and crude ash including calcium and phosphorus while containing less fiber than Dactylis glomerata and Lolium perenne. Furthermore, Plantago lanceolata was more abundant than Trifolium repens, also included in the sowing mixture...|$|E
40|$|The paper applies a semi-parametric {{propensity}} score matching approach {{to evaluate the}} effects of <b>agri-environment</b> (AE) <b>programmes</b> on input use and farm output of individual farms in Germany. The analysis reveals a positive and significant treatment effect of AE programmes on the area under cultivation, in particular grassland, resulting in a decrease of cattle livestock densities. Furthermore, participation significantly reduced the purchase of farm chemicals (fertiliser, pesticide). We also find differences in the treatment effect among individual farms (heterogeneous treatment effects).

40|$|European <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programmes</b> {{are based}} on the common {{principle}} that farmers deliver environmental services for which society pays. Due to the voluntary nature of agri-environment measures (AEM), the issue of farmers' motives or reasons for participation has been an important topic of investigation in past years. The present paper examines farmers' rationale for participation in AEM against the backdrop of continued debate over whether to develop relatively simple measures that can be readily applied by many farmers or give greater priority to measures that are more targeted - i. e. to the specific management requirement of particular habitats or species - but are often more complex. The paper draws on empirical material from a case study in the Dyle valley, Belgium, including in-depth interviews, expert consultations and a mail survey. It was sought not only to identify and quantify the importance of separate reasons for participation, but also to reveal how these reasons and other elements of relevance were logically interrelated in the explanation that farmers themselves give for their participation. As a result, six modes or styles of participation were identified: opportunistic, calculative, compensatory, optimising, catalysing and engaged. The analyses suggest that there were notable differences in that both separate reasons for and modes of participation do vary with the complexity of the measures' requirements. Overall, the study demonstrates that participation in AEM is {{not simply a matter of}} weighing the money against the effort for adoption. Whereas money is an important driver for participation (in particular, for those adopting complex AEM) it plays widely differing roles depending on the level of farmers' reasoning (farm enterprise, single practice or landscape feature) and the importance they give to other considerations (environmental effect, production potential of land, goodness of fit, etc.). Practical implications are drawn for both policy makers and programme managers who develop and make available tailor-made support. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is the nutrient, {{limiting}} {{algae growth}} {{in most of}} the lakes and rivers in Finland and therefore a reduction of phosphorus load should be carried out if algae blooms are a problem. In the Baltic Sea a reduction of both phosphorus and nitrogen has earlier been considered to be needed to reduce algae growth but recently also research papers where phosphorus has been pointed out to initially be the limiting nutrient has been published. It has been calculated that a reduction of nitrogen load by 50 % to the Baltic Sea would be four times as expensive as a similar reduction of phosphorus load. Today countries in the Baltic Sea catchment area report already some success in reducing loads of phosphorus, but little for nitrogen. Thus the expensive measures to reduce load should be used in reducing phosphorus, instead of nitrogen. In Finland the first step in this work has been a proper reduction of phosphorus content in urban and industrial sewage waters. This activity started already in the 70 ties. The reduction of the phosphorus load in urban wastewater is today 95 %. This reduction has resulted in reduced algae (cyanobacterial) blooms in the urban wastewater affected sea areas, lakes and rivers. The second step in Finland will be the reduction of phosphorus in rural wastewater by 85 per cent to be carried out before the year 2014. The third step should be a reduction of phosphorus load from agriculture. An attempt to start this work has been made already 10 years ago when the Finnish <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>Programme</b> was established. However this program has not been successful in reducing phosphorus load, although during 1995 - 2004 as much as 2. 5 billion has been used. It has been calculated that a chemical treatment to reduce the phosphorus content of all our field waters would not amount more than 0. 07 billion /year. Therefore in our Finnish <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>Programme</b> the chemical treatment of waters from agricultural areas should be included. In this paper a low cost treatment method to reduce phosphorus content in waters from agricultural areas is introduced. If these three steps would be carried out in all the catchment countries, the phosphorus load to the Baltic Sea could be reduced to a level which it was one hundred years ago.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{relatively recent}} innovations in the Dutch <b>agri-environment</b> <b>programme</b> which have helped nature management to be contiguous with natural features allowing the landscape {{to be managed}} whole rather than piecemeal—and thus generate higher quality and greater scope in environmental management. The first two, joint submissions by neighbouring farmers and payments related {{to the level of}} environmental output delivered, are scheme innovations. The third, Environmental Co-operatives (EC) —clubs of neighbouring farmers that inter alia co-ordinate and help manage the scheme innovations—is an institutional innovation. None has an equivalent in the UK. Evidence from interviews with farmer and non-farmer members, policy makers, academics and other interested parties show the role EC play in overcoming some of the postulated problems of the two scheme innovations. Not all the problems have been overcome, and cost-benefit analyses have not been conducted, nevertheless there is sufficient evidence to suggest that these innovations have benefited all actors involved: farmers, the government, the environment and the rural economy. Analysis of UK agri-environment policy using actor network theory (ANT) suggests the UK government will need to show similar levels of trust in and commitment to the farming community before these innovations could be introduced in the UK. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to provide an up-to-date overview of the organic and inconversion land area, number of holdings, livestock and crop production in all EU member states plus the Czech Republic, Norway and Switzerland from 1993 to 1998. The report traces the growth and development of organic farming in general {{and as part of}} policy measures to support organic farming and updates the data presented in Foster and Lampkin (1999). This report is one of several aiming to assess ex post the impact of EU and other policy measures on organic farming as part of the project ”Effects of the CAP Reform and possible further developments on organic farming in the EU” (FAIR 3 -CT 96 1794).
