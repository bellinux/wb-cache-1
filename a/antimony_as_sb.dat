However, most of them only respond to ultraviolet light, which limits their further applications. In the present work, S 2 −-doped Sb 2 O 3 nanocrystal was prepared using SbCl 3 and thioacetamide (TAA) as the sulfur source by a hydrothermal synthesis method. The effects of the S doping on the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of Sb 2 O 3 for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and 4 -phenylazophenol were also evaluated. The {{results indicated that the}} S 2 − doping was able to effectively narrow the band gap of Sb 2 O 3 and thus improved the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of the Sb 2 O 3.

We have worked with industrial zinc sulphate solutions. During the process of activated cementation of Co and Ni, copper (involved as CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O) and <b>antimony</b> (involved <b>as</b> <b>Sb</b> 2 O 3) were used as activators. The lowest values of Co content have been obtained at a temperature of 80 - 85 oC, CCu = 200 - 300 mg/dm 3 and 18 multiple surplus of zinc dust. After adding Cu to the solution, mainly the cementation of Ni is activated, and that of Co is activated to a lower degree. It was found that when GSb : GCo ratio is between 0. 5 : 1 and 2 : 1, the solution is purified from Co and Ni to a great degree. After intensive stirring and increasing the duration of the process the cement sediments dissolve reversely. This holds true of Co to a greater extent, as compared to Ni.

Using outdated computer printed circuit boards (PCBs), a ubiquitous component of e-waste, we investigated transformations across a range of temperatures and time frames. Results indicate a two-step heat treatment process, using a low temperature step followed by a high temperature step, can be used to produce and separate off, first, a lead (Pb) based alloy and, subsequently, a Cu-Sn based alloy. We also found a single-step heat treatment process at a moderate temperature of 900 °C can be used to directly transform old PCBs to produce a Cu-Sn based alloy, while capturing the Pb and <b>antimony</b> (<b>Sb)</b> <b>as</b> alloying elements to prevent the emission of these low melting point elements.

The iodine was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) following tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) extraction at 90 °C in disposable polypropylene tubes. While similar approaches have been used previously, this method adopted a shorter extraction time (1 h vs. 3 h) and used <b>antimony</b> (<b>Sb)</b> <b>as</b> the internal standard, which exhibited greater stability in breast milk and milk powder matrices compared to tellurium (Te). Method validation included: defining iodine linearity up to 200 μgL(- 1); confirming recovery of iodine from NIST 1549 milk powder. A recovery of 94 - 98 % was also achieved for the NIST 1549 milk powder and human breast milk samples spiked with sodium iodide and thyroxine (T 4) solutions. The method quantitation limit (MQL) for human breast milk was 1. 6 μgL(- 1). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation for the breast milk samples and NIST powder were < 1 % and < 3. 5 %, respectively. NIST 1549 milk powder, human breast milk samples and calibration standards spiked with the internal standard were all stable for at least 2. 5 months after extraction. The results of the validation process confirmed that this newly developed method provides greater accuracy and precision {{in the assessment of}} iodine concentrations in human breast milk than previous methods and therefore offers a more reliable approach for assessing iodine concentrations in human breast milk.

40|$|International audienceFe(III) oxide such as ferrihydrite are {{ubiquitous}} in sediments and soils {{and due to}} their large surface area and reactive surface properties, they can be important sorbents of metal and metalloid such <b>as</b> <b>antimony</b> (<b>Sb).</b> Sorption and co-precipitation {{are considered to be}} the predominant processes by which most of the metals are scavenged by iron oxides, although co-precipitation appears to be more efficient for the removal of metals from solution. However, co-precipitated metals can be released to the surrounding environment as a direct or indirect consequence of dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR), which is a microbial reduction process of geochemical importance in natural systems. Even if DIR is often implicated in the remobilization of metals, the subsequent bio-mineralization processes can lead to their sequestration into secondary mineral products. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate Sb behavior during DIR. Sb-bearing ferrihydrites, with variable Sb/(Fe+Sb) molar ratios, were synthezised by coprecipitation and incubated with an iron reducing bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR 1. Chemical analysis were undertaken to monitor the rate and the extent of the bioreduction and the mobilisation of Sb. Mössbauer analysis were carried out to characterize the bulk cation properties of the biogenic minerals at different temperatures. The spectra were fitted to obtain degrees of oxidation of iron and therefore it's mineralogical signature. Measurements of the magnetization with respect to applied magnetic field were also carried out at room and low temperature and coercivity, saturation magnetization and remanence data obtained from hysteresis loops. The results revealed that the presence of Sb impacted the extent of reduction but no significant difference was measured in the rate of Fe(III) reduction. Although, the precipitaion of biogenic magnetite was evidenced independently of the intial Sb/(Fe+Sb) molar ratios, the biogenic magnetites displayed variable structural and magnetic properties implying an incorporation of Sb in their crystallographic structure...|$|R
40|$|Tin oxide (SnO 2) {{thin films}} are having {{promising}} properties {{such as high}} visible transmittance and low electric resistivity, makes them very important transparent conductor {{in a variety of}} optoelectronics devices. Further, doping with pentavalent impurity such <b>as</b> <b>Antimony</b> (<b>Sb)</b> enhances its conductivity considerably. In order to study the effect of Antimony doping, Antimony doped tin oxide (SnO 2  : Sb) thin films have been prepared by the co-evaporation of Sn and Sb using Plasma Assisted Thermal Evaporation (PATE) in oxygen (O 2) partial pressure at various doping level from 4 % to 25 %. The influence of various Sb doping levels on the compositional, electrical, optical and structural properties have been investigated using Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-VIS) transmission spectroscopy, four-probe resistivity measurement and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. EDX studies confirmed the different Sb doping levels in the grown films from 4  % to 25  %, while electrical resistivity is obtained in range of 0. 36 to 9. 5  Ohmcm using four-probe setup for 4  % to 25  % Sb doping levels. Transmittance spectra measured in UV-VIS range for Sb doped films show reduction in an average transmittance in respect to increase in Sb doping levels in the grown films. Whereas, XRD analysis reveals that higher Sb doping of 25  % induce the precipitation of antimony oxide (Sb 2 O 3) phase and its precipitation suppressed the growth of SnO 2 peaks as well as responsible for reduction in conductivity and transparency. The best electrical resistivity of optimized SnO 2  : Sb (5  %) is 0. 36  Ohmcm without deteriorating the high (~  80  %) average transmittance in the wavelength region 300 - 800  nm in comparison to undoped SnO 2 film (6. 57  Ohmcm), confirm the usefulness of SnO 2  : Sb (5  %) films for device applications...|$|R

This paper reports a compilation of reproducible bioaccessible guidance values for fifty-five additional elements in BGS 102, providing guidance for analysts to broaden the scope of UBM analyses for {{a wider range of}} elements based on data collected over an average of 60 separate analytical batches per element. Data are presented in categories for both gastric (STOM) and gastrointestinal (STOM + INT) extraction phases, where reproducibility, measured as relative standard deviation (RSD) was; ≤ 10 % RSD for 27 elements (Mg, Al, Si, P, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb); between 10 and 20 % RSD for 10 elements (Li, K, V, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Lu, Pb, U); and ≥ 20 % RSD for 19 elements in the gastric phase (Be, B, S, Ti, Ga, Se, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Sn, Sb, Cs, Hf, Ta, W, Tl, Bi, Th). Two elements (Mg, Rb) met the ≤ 10 % RSD criteria in the UBM gastrointestinal extraction phase due to the alkaline conditions of this phase precipitating out the majority of determinands. Certain elements, including Na, K, Zn and Se, were found to be a significant component of the extraction fluids with proportionally higher concentrations compared to the {{guidance material}}.
