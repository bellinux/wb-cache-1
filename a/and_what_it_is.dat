500|$|To {{navigate}} the world, the player simply clicks {{in the direction}} they want to walk or turn. The mouse cursor changes in appearance, depending on its position on the screen <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have. [...] For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near {{the side of the}} screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction. The cursor also changes in context to show when players can drag or toggle switches, or when certain items can be picked up and carried. Such items can then be examined at any time, and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game's setting and story. [...] Like Myst, Riven has an optional method of navigation known as Zip Mode, which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues.|$|E
500|$|Of Locke's major {{claims in}} the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Some Thoughts Concerning Education, two played a {{defining}} role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes {{at the opening of}} his treatise, [...] "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." [...] In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his Essay Locke posits an [...] "empty" [...] mind—a tabula rasa—that is [...] "filled" [...] by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on Plato's Theatetus, which suggests that the mind is like a [...] "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the tabula rasa theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their [...] "aptitudes," [...] and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fit for." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 May 2014, Pope Francis, in an {{interview}} given to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, expressed his opinion and praise for Humanae Vitae: [...] "Everything depends on how Humanae Vitae is interpreted. Paul VI himself, in the end, urged confessors to be very merciful {{and pay attention to}} concrete situations. But his genius was prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism. The question is not of changing doctrine, but of digging deep and making sure that pastoral care takes into account situations <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible for persons to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s, {{corporate}} {{social responsibility}} has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders in regard to its benefits <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Corporate social responsibility has been defined differently by different writers {{based on what they}} perceive about the concept. Having learnt from the devastating effects of corporate social irresponsibility, companies are focusing on the impacts of their operations not only on profits but the society and environment at large. Therefore, {{corporate social responsibility}} refers to [...] "the ethical principle that an organization [...] should be responsible for how its behaviour might affect society and the environment". [...] From 1960, [...] "corporate social responsibility" [...] has remained a term used indiscriminately by many to cover legal and moral responsibility more narrowly construed.|$|E

2500|$|PET scans are {{increasingly}} read alongside CT or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [...] "co-registration") giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> doing biochemically). Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called [...] "PET-CT"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between {{the two types of}} scans, the two sets of images are more precisely registered, so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout its history, the Mekorot {{has been}} financially stable {{according}} to information published on its website. In 2006, Mekorot's turnover was over $700 million, shareholders' equity was $500 million and total assets were {{in excess of}} $2.8 billion. In 2006, Mekorot invested over $240 million in developing water facilities, including a new central filtration plant, compared with $180 million in investments in 2005. For {{a number of years}} Mekorot's fundraising instruments (primarily, bond offerings) have been awarded the highest AAA rating by the [...] credit rating agency based on the following factors: Because tariffs established by the government are low and do not cover Mekorot's operating costs, the company receives compensation for the difference between what it costs to produce a unit of water <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> allowed to charge.

2500|$|As {{its history}} indicates, the popular {{use of the}} word racism is {{relatively}} recent. The word came into widespread usage in the Western world in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of Nazism, which saw [...] "race" [...] as a naturally given political unit. It is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word, but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. Today, some scholars of racism prefer to use the concept in the plural racisms in order to emphasize its many different forms that do not easily fall under a single definition and they also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas. Garner (2009: p.11) summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism. First, a historical, hierarchical power relationship between groups; second, a set of ideas (an ideology) about racial differences; and, third, discriminatory actions (practices).|$|E
