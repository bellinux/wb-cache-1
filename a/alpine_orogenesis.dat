The evolution of the Alpine mountain system in Europe can be compared with the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> in Indonesia (the Sunda mountain system). On the other hand, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> in the Himalayan section is mainly the effect of the northward drift of the Indian subcontinent.

The Hekimhan Basin formed as part of the northern margin of the Taurides during the collision of the Inner Tauride Ocean and the İzmir–Ankara–Erzincan ocean (Fig.  1 a). The units in this area have mainly folded and fractured structure because of being influenced by <b>Alpine</b> <b>Orogenesis.</b> A constant sedimentary sequence has been loaded on the overthrusts that occurred in the Late Kimmeridge Phase of Early <b>Alpine</b> <b>Orogenesis,</b> starting from Maastrichtian until Upper Miocene begining. Campanian–Maastrichtian aged transgressive and regressive series present the common crop area (Şengör and Yılmaz 1981; Booth et al. 2014). This basin has been precipitated together with shallow marine and continental sedimentation, which is the case in the other basins of Central Anatolia, which reflects the clastic and carbonate precipitation in common. Maastrichtian sediments, which are rich in detritics, and coral reef limestone that contain rudist (Hippurites sp.) show the precipitation process of the basin in early periods (Gürer 1992).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. – In the Aosta Valley, the Gran San Bernardo nappe, which {{comprises}} the basement sequences classically re- ferred to as Ruitor Massif and Zona Interna, {{appears to be}} a stack of distinct basement units with distinct lithological features and contrasting tectono-metamorphic evolution piled up during the Eocene. In the former Zona Interna, two dif- ferent units (Gran Nomenon and Leverogne) have been distinguished. The Gran Nomenon unit is a polymetamorphic basement unit, with a pre-Alpine epidote-amphibolite facies metamorphic imprint, intruded by granitoid rocks during the early Mississippian. It bears the evidence of a pervasive Alpine metamorphic overprint under greenschist facies conditions, and does not share common characters with any other basement sequence exposed in the Gran San Bernardo nappe. The Leverogne unit is a monometamorphic basement unit, with some analogies with the Mont Pourri basement sequence, intruded by granophyric rocks of Middle Cambrian age. It suffered epidote-blueschist and greenschist facies metamorphism during the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis,</b> and shows a deformation history partly different with respect to the Gran Nomenon unit. These units are bounded by tectonic melanges that represent Alpine shear zones, and have been juxtapo- sed under greenschist facies conditions during the late stages of exhumation of the belt. The Gran Nomenon unit, which does not show a significant HP/LT overprint, was probably not as deeply buried as the Leverogne and the Ruitor units during <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} tectonic {{synthesis}} and an animation of the tectonics {{of the western}} Mediterranean since the Oligocene. This work is based on data derived from different geological datasets, such as structural geology, the distribution of metamorphic rocks, magmatic activity, sedimentary patterns, palaeomagnetic data and geophysics. Reconstruction was performed using an interactive software package (PLATYPLUS), which enabled us to apply rotational motions to numerous microplates and continental terranes involved {{in the evolution of}} the western Mediterranean basins. Boundary conditions are provided by the relative motions of Africa and Iberia with respect to Europe, and the Adriatic plate is considered here as an African promontory. The reconstruction shows that during <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis,</b> a very wide zone in the interface between Africa and Europe underwent extension. Extensional tectonics was governed by rollback of subduction zones triggered by gravitational instability of old and dense oceanic lithosphere. Back-arc extension occurred in the overriding plates as a result of slow convergence rates combined with rapid subduction rollback. This mechanism can account for the evolution of the majority of the post-Oligocene extensional systems in the western Mediterranean. Moreover, extension led to drifting and rotations of continental terranes towards the retreating slabs in excess of 100 - 800 km. These terranes - Corsica, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, the Kabylies blocks, Calabria and the Rif-Betic - drifted as long as subduction rollback took place, and were eventually accreted to the adjacent continents. We conclude that large-scale horizontal motions associated with subduction rollback, back-arc extension and accretion of allochthonous terranes played a fundamental role during <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} a number of {{crystalline}} regions around the Dolomites in North Italy. The geographic position is shown on sheet I, which is depicted in fig. 105. The Dolomites proper consist mainly of Permotriassic, overlying a transgression plane, which cuts off the studied crystalline rocks. The tectonics of this crystalline basement have been scarcely studied hitherto, in contradistinction with the overlying sediments, the Alpine tectonics of which are rather wellknown. The complexity of the geometry of the crystalline basement, which may have caused this apparent lack of interest, is due to several factors. In the first place, a general stratigraphy of these uniform and for the greater part mesozonal micaschists has not been established. Therefore, it is necessary to base the tectonic interpretation almost entirely on the schistosity and the generally present minor folds. The age of these tectonical elements is generally pre-Permian. It can be proved that originally subhorizontal schistOsity-planes have been folded twice during the Hercynian orogenesis. In the second place, this Hercynian folded basement was deformed intensively during the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> A clear distinction between Hercynian and <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> is possible only by studying the pure Alpine tectonics of the adjacent Permotriassic sediments. For this reason, and because the existing geologic maps appeared to be inadequate, certain parts of these sediments have been mapped again. The fundamental tectonical values are scattered around the mean of the group to which they belong. Only the mean of a number of single values is a basis for regional tectonics. The means vary from place to place. Many measurements had to be made to determine the geometry of the means. A methodology had to be developed for calculating the means and for constructing the structure maps...|$|E

Redbeds experienced temperatures in the range of 100 °– 160 °C and lithostatic/ tectonic loading of more than 4 km.

Sulphides that re-crystallised under eclogitic conditions incorporated an old continental Pb component, which was released from gangue minerals or neighbouring sediments by dehydration reactions at the blueschist–eclogite transition. Our data suggest a limited mobility of sulphide-hosted metals in the subducted oceanic crust up to eclogite-facies conditions. Sulphides in the blueschist-facies and, possibly, eclogite-facies units incorporated further continental Pb derived from oceanic metasedimentary host-rocks containing a continent-sourced terrigenous component during subsequent greenschist-facies metamorphism.

Mafic and ultramafic cumulus enclaves occur within the Euganean trachytes.

Parental melts of cumulus clinopyroxenes are characterized by a marked enrichment in LILE, Th and U relative to N-MORB. Conversely, HREE and HFSE concentrations resemble N-MORB contents. These geochemical signatures are typical of subduction-related magmas, and also characterized the parental melts of Adamello cumulates. Conversely, Veneto Volcanic Province mafic lavas show geochemical patterns typical of anorogenic magmas. Therefore, those rocks are not cogenetic with Euganean cumulates, which are interpreted as crystallized from Alpine subduction-related basaltic magmas. These cumulates were subsequently dismembered and transported to shallower levels by ascending lavas related to the Veneto Volcanic Province magmatism.

The mineralization, made up mostly of barite with subordinated sphalerite and very minor galena and Zn-carbonates, is found in grey epimetamorphic Megalodon dolomites (Carnic-Noric in age). The Sr content in the barite ranges from 5700 to 32, 000 ppm, the lowest value shown by the synsedimentary occurrence of barite and the highest related to barite remobilization.

New pollen data, together with abundant existing palynological information from this area, show a progressive reduction in plant diversity caused by a decrease in the most ther-mophilous and high-water requirement plants and, on the contrary, an increase in warm-temperate (mesothermic) and seasonal-adapted taxa during the Middle–Late Miocene and Pliocene. At the same time, an increase in high-elevation trees and herbs has been recorded, with a strong augmen-tation in Artemisia, first in the eastern Mediterranean and later on in the western Mediterranean area.

Most of the metabasites show Nb anomalies, indicative of derivation from a subduction-aVected mantle. The igneous bodies were juxtaposed and incorporated into the enclosing sedimentary sequences prior to high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) metamorphism (M 1). Glaucophane, epidote, sodic clinopyroxene and high-Si phengite constitute the Eocene M 1 assem-blage, which is estimated to have formed at> 11 kbar and 400 – 450 °C. High d 18 O values of M 1 minerals in Ochi metagabbros indicate that the formation of the high-pressure assemblage was controlled by infiltration of fluids from the dehydrating host sediments. Cooling during decompression is indicated by an overprinting (M 2, Early Miocene) pumpellyite–actinolite facies assemblage in metabasic rocks, calcu-lated to have developed at P< 8 kbar and T< 350 °C.

This process, related to the forebulge uplift at the latest stages of <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis,</b> is amply recorded in the geochemical signature of contemporaneous bauxites. In order to elucidate the patterns of bauxite formation a discriminant function model based on the Compositional Data (CoDa) analysis (major and trace elements) is constructed providing the solid ground for separation of the bauxite groups deposited in the subaerially exposed Istrian palaeoenvironment. Complete distinction between the four a priori defined ILPB groups achieved by the analysis demonstrates the highest degree of efficiency in characterizing environmental conditions marked by the unique suite of geochemical variables (compositions).

The isotopic ratios range from 0. 712829 to 0. 713960. As siderite contains negligible Rb, the measured isotopic ratios are the same as its parent fluids. In this view, the isotopic ratios of the carbonate rule out that the mineralizing solutions were composed of either magmatic fluids, as the local granites show a range of initial ratios between 0. 706 and 0. 709, or seawater, whose isotopic ratio about 286 Ma was 0. 7075. On the contrary, the mineralizing fluids were composed of meteoric water circulating mainly through the schists of the Palaeozoic basement, whose isotopic range was between 0. 712 and 0. 718 at the time of the ore deposit formation. Moreover, the Sr-isotope ratios of siderite rule out any possible recrystallization of the carbonate during the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> As a whole, this study shows the possibility of using siderite for determining the type of fluids involved in ore deposits, provided that the age and the Sr-isotope ratios of the rocks of the mineralized area are known.

40|$|International audienceThe French Massif Central {{is a part}} of the Hercynian orogenic {{belt that}} {{currently}} exhibits anomalously high topography. The <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis,</b> which deeply marked Western European topography, involved only marginally the Massif Central, where Cenozoic faulting and short-wavelength crustal deformation is limited to the Oligocene rifting. For this reason the French Massif Central is a key site to study short and long-term topographic response in a framework of slow tectonic activity. In particular the origin of the Massif Central topography is a topical issue still debated, where the role of mantle upwelling is invoked by different authors. Here we present a landscape analysis using denudation rates derived from basin-averaged cosmogenic nuclide concentrations coupled with longitudinal river profile analysis. This analysis allows us to recognize that the topography of the French Massif Central is not fully equilibrated with the present base level and in transient state. Our data highlight the coexistence of out-of-equilibrium river profiles, incised valleys, and low cosmogenically derived denudation rates ranging between 40 mm/kyr and 80 mm/kyr. Addressing this apparent inconsistency requires investigating the parameters that may govern erosion processes under conditions of reduced active tectonics. The spatial distribution of denudation rates coupled with topography analysis enabled us to trace the signal of the long-term uplift history and to propose a chronology for the uplift evolution of the French Massif Central.

In order to {{investigate}} the effects of orogenic cycles occurring along the plate margin, a multi-disciplinary approach was used in this study. Paleotemperature analysis and low-temperature thermochronometry were combined with stratigraphic data to obtain a burial model for the Paleozoic succession exposed in the study area. Maximum burial for Silurian and Devonian rocks occurred during the Devonian and Early Carboniferous at depths of 4 - 5 km, as constrained by vitrinite reflectance and illite content in mixed illite-smectite layers. Thermochronometric data indicate that exhumation through the 45 - 120 °C temperature range took place between the Late Triassic and the Early Jurassic, and that no significant burial occurred afterwards (temperatures characterising the stratigraphically lowermost units remaining below ca. 60 °C). These results point to a major exhumation event coeval with the Cimmerian orogenesis, which took place a few hundreds of kilometres away from the study area. On the other hand, no significant effect of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> was recorded, although the collisional front was located < 100 km from the Podolia region. This work shows how paleothermal and thermochronometric analyses can be successfully integrated with stratigraphic data to reconstruct the burial history, and how the burial history of a basin located on a plate margin can, in some cases, be independent from the distance of the margin from the collisional fronts...|$|E
40|$|Meta-peridotites {{outcropping}} {{at different}} structural levels within the Alpine metamorphic complex of the Cycladic island of Naxos were studied to re-examine their metamorphic evolution and possible tectonic mechanisms for emplacement of mantle material into the continental crust. The continental margin section exposed on Naxos, consisting of pre-Alpine basement and c. 7 km thick Mesozoic platform cover, has undergone intense metamorphism of Alpine age, comprising an Eocene (M 1) blueschist event strongly overprinted by a Miocene Barrovian-type event (M 2). Structural concordance {{with the country}} rocks and metasomatic zonation at the contact with the felsic host rocks indicate that the meta-peridotites have experienced the M 2 metamorphism. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} similarity between metamorphic temperatures of the ultrabasic rocks and those of the host rocks. Maximum temperatures of 730 – 760 °C were calculated for the upper-amphibolite facies meta-peridotites (Fo–En–Hbl–Chl–Spl), associated with sillimanite gneisses and migmatites. Relict phases in ultrabasics of different structural levels indicate two distinct pre-M 2 histories: whereas the cover-associated horizons have been affected by low-grade serpentinization prior to metamorphism, the basement- associated meta-peridotites show no signs of serpentinization and instead preserve some of their original mantle assemblage. The geochemical affinities of the two groups are also different. The basement-associated meta-peridotites retain their original composition indicating derivation by fractional partial melting of primitive lherzolite, whereas serpentinization has led to almost complete Ca-loss in the second group. The cover-associated ultrabasics are interpreted as remnants of an ophiolite sequence obducted on the adjacent continental shelf early in the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> In contrast, the basement-associated meta-peridotites were tectonically interleaved with the Naxos section at great depth during the Alpine collision and high P/T metamorphism. Their emplacement {{at the base of the}} orogenic wedge is inferred to have involved isobaric cooling from temperatures of c. 1050 °C within the spinel lherzolite field to eclogite facies temperatures of c. 600 °C...|$|E
40|$|Compositional and {{chemical}} analyses suggest that Middle Triassic–Lower Liassic continental redbeds (in the internal domains of the Betic, Maghrebian, and Apenninic chains) {{can be considered}} a regional lithosome marking the Triassic-Jurassic rift-valley stage of Tethyan rifting, which led to the Pangaea breakup and subsequent development of a mosaic of plates and microplates. Sandstones are quartzose to quartzolithic and represent a provenance of continental block and recycled orogen, made up mainly of Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks similar to those underlying the redbeds. Mudrocks display K enrichments; intense paleoweathering under a hot, episodically humid climate with a prolonged dry season; and sediment recycling. Redbeds experienced temperatures in the range of 100 °– 160 °C and lithostatic/tectonic loading of more than 4 km. These redbeds represent an important stratigraphic signature to reconstruct a continental block (Mesomediterranean Microplate) that separated different realms of the western Tethys from Middle-Late Jurassic to Miocene, when it was completely involved in <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> This work was funded by the Ministero dell’Universtità e della Ricerca Scientifica–Progetto di Ricerca Nazionale (MIUR-PRIN) 2001 – 2003 Project (“Age and Sedimentary Characters of the Mesozoic Continental Redbeds [Verrucano] from Northern Apennines to the Betic Cordillera: Implications for Paleogeographic and Tectonic Evolution of the Central-Western Mediterranean Alpine Belts,” S.

40|$|The Variscan {{basement}} of Northern Apennines (Northern Italy) is a polymetamorphic portion of continental crust. This thesis investigated the metamorphic {{history of this}} basement occurring in the Cerreto Pass, in the Pontremoli well, and in the Pisani Mountains. The study comprised fieldwork, petrography and microstructural analysis, determination of the bulk rock and mineral composition, thermodynamic modelling, conventional geothermobarometry, monazite chemical dating and Ar/Ar dating of muscovite. The reconstructed metamorphic evolution of the selected samples allowed to define a long-lasting metamorphic history straddling the Variscan and <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> Some general petrological issues generally found in low- to medium-grade metapelites were also tackled: (i) With middle-grade micaschist {{it is possible to}} reconstruct a complete P-T-D path by combining microstructural analysis and thermodynamic modelling. Prekinematic white mica may preserve Mg-rich cores related to the pre-peak stage. Mn-poor garnet rim records the peak metamorphism. Na-rich mylonitic white mica, the XFe of chlorite and the late paragenesis may constrain the retrograde stage. (ii) Metapelites may contain coronitic microstructures of apatite + Th-silicate, allanite and epidote around unstable monazite grains. Chemistry and microstructure of Th-rich monazite relics surrounded by this coronitic microstructure may suggest that monazite mineral was inherited and underwent partial dissolution and fluid-aided replacement by REE-accessory minerals at 500 - 600 °C and 5 - 7 kbar. (iii) Fish-shaped white mica is not always a (prekinematic) mica-fish. Observed at high-magnification BSE images it may consist of several white mica formed during a mylonitic stage. Hence, the asymmetric foliation boudin is a suitable microstructure to obtain geochronological information about the shearing stage. (iv) Thermodynamic modelling of a hematite-rich metasedimentary rock fails to reproduce the observed mineral compositions when the bulk Fe 2 O 3 is neglected or determined through titration. The mismatch between observed and computed mineral compositions and assemblage is resolved by tuning the effective ferric iron content by P-XFe 2 O 3 diagrams. ...|$|E
40|$|The passive {{continental}} margins which {{surround the}} North Atlantic region {{have been subject}} to widespread post-Triassic exhumation, the timing, magnitude and causes of which are debated. Exhumation of up to 6 km (but more generally ≤ 3 km) has been shown to have affected the Western UK Continental Shelf. This region contains a series of intra-plate extensional basins which formed during Permian-Jurassic rifting. Using a combination of palaeothermal (apatite fission-track analysis and vitrinite reflectance data) seismic and compaction data, this study has revealed an exhumation history of far greater complexity than previously suspected across the Southwest UK, with regional kilometer-scale exhumation episodes beginning during the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic (215 - 195 Ma), Lower Cretaceous (140 - 120 Ma), early Paleogene (75 - 55 Ma), Eocene-Oligocene (35 - 20 Ma) and Neogene (20 - 10 Ma). Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic exhumation appears confined to the footwalls of major basin bounding faults, suggesting footwall uplift was the principal cause of this episode of exhumation. Lower Cretaceous exhumation corresponds with continental breakup SW of Britain, suggesting a causative link. Early Paleogene exhumation was coeval with the Laramide phase of Alpine orogeny suggesting a causative link and additionally, marked heterogeneities in the pattern of this exhumation have been identified, casting doubt on the previously invoked role of plume-related epeirogenesis. Eocene-Oligocene and Neogene exhumation coincides temporally with the Pyrenean and Late Alpine compressional episodes. Seismic data shows that early and late Cenozoic exhumation was probably caused by compressional deformation related to <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> and/or Atlantic ridge-push. These observations imply that events at plate margins have exerted the primary control upon intra-plate exhumation in the Southwest UK onshore and offshore basin system with local faults providing an important control on the distribution of this exhumatio...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} new Structural {{data from}} a high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) metamorphic terrane exposed on the islands of Syros and Sifnos (Cyclades, Greece). The structure and the metamorphism of a relatively coherent HP/LT rock section were studied in order to elucidate how strain was accommodated at deep crustal levels during the formation and exhumation of HP/LT rocks. At least three deformation phases associated with eclogite- and blueschist-facies conditions (P = 8 - 15 kbar; T = 400 - 550 degreesC) were recognised. The earliest deformation fabric (S 1), preserved as inclusion trails within garnet porphyroblasts, is aligned to define a sub-vertical schistosity (at present orientation), which is frequently orthogonal to the flat matrix schistosity (S 2), and may indicate that deep crustal thickening involved upright folding. The currently dominant fabric in the HP rock section, S 2, is Usually moderately dipping and locally contains NW-trending glaucophane lineations, symmetric pressure-shadows and eclogitic boudins. The symmetric structures associated with this fabric seem to indicate coaxial vertical thinning, although the existence of non-coaxial structures out {{of the study area}} cannot be excluded. Glaucophane-bearing shear bands (S 3), with top-to-NW sense of shearing, locally crosscut the earlier structures. The latest recognised fabric (D 4) is scarce and often absent within the HP rocks. It is associated with top-to-NE kinematic criteria that formed at greenschist-facies conditions (P = 4 - 7 kbar; T = 400 - 450 degreesC). Based on these observations, it is suggested that partitioning of strain occurred at different crustal levels and at different times. Deep crustal deformation was governed by thickening via upright folding followed by coaxial vertical thinning, whereas non-coaxial shearing occurred when the rocks were already exhumed to relatively shallow crustal levels. The earliest fabrics (D 1 to D 3) pertain to <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis</b> and possibly to syn-orogenic extension, whereas the latest correspond to whole-crust back-are extension.

40|$|The {{manganese}} ore of Praborna (ItalianWestern Alps) is embeddedwithin a metasedimentary sequence {{belonging to a}} subduction mélange equilibrated at high-pressure (HP) conditions (ca. 2 GPa) during the <b>Alpine</b> <b>orogenesis.</b> The pervasive veining of the ore {{and the growth of}} “pegmatoid” HP minerals suggest that these Mn-rich rocks strongly interacted with slab-derived fluids during HP metamorphism. These rocks are in textural and chemical equilibriumwith the veins and in contactwith sulphide- andmagnetite-bearing metabasites {{at the bottom of the}} sequence. They contain braunite (Mn 2 +Mn 3 + 6 SiO 12), quartz, pyroxmangite (Mn 2 +SiO 3), and minor hematite, omphacite, piemontite and spessartine-rich garnet. Sulphides are absent in theMn-rich rocks,whereas sulphates (barite, celestine) occur togetherwith As- and Sb-oxides and silicates. This rock association provides an excellent natural laboratory to constrain the redox conditions in subducting oceanic slab mélanges at HP and fluid-present conditions. Similarly to Fe-bearing minerals, Mn oxides and silicates can be regarded as natural redox-sensors. A thermodynamic dataset for these Mn-bearing minerals is built, using literature data as well as newthermal expansion parameters for braunite aud pyrolusite, derived fromexperiments. Based on this dataset and the observed assemblages at Praborna, thermodynamic calculations show that these mélange rocks are characterised by ultra-oxidized conditions (ΔFMQ up to + 12. 7) if the chemical potential of oxygen (or the oxygen fugacity fO 2) is accounted for. On the other hand, if the molar quantity of oxygen is used as the independent state variable to quantify the bulk oxidation state, the ore appears onlymoderately oxidized and comparable to typical subduction-slab mafic eclogites. Such an apparent contradiction may happen in rock systemswhenever oxygen is improperly considered as a perfectly mobile component. In the Earth's mantle, redox reactions take place mainly between solid oxides and silicates, because O 2 is a negligible species in the fluid phase. Therefore, the description of the redox conditions of most petrological systems requires the introduction of an extensive variable, namely the oxygen molar quantity (nO 2). As a consequence, the oxygen chemical potential, and thus fO 2, becomes a dependent state variable, not univocally indicative of the redox conditions of the entire rock column of a subduction zone, from the dehydrating oceanic crust to the overlying mantle wedge. On a more general basis, the comparison of fO 2 retrieved fromdifferent bulk compositions and different phase assemblages is sometimes challenging and should be undertakenwith care. From the study of mélange rocks at Praborna, the distribution of oxygen at subduction zones could be modelled as an oxidation gradient, grading froma maximum in the subducted altered oceanic crust to a minimum in the overlying peridotites of the mantle hanging-wall...|$|E
