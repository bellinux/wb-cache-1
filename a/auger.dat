5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Burhop was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford. Under the supervision of Mark Oliphant, he investigated nuclear fusion. He produced a non-relativistic theory of the <b>Auger</b> effect in 1935, followed by a relativistic treatment the following year. He later wrote a monograph on the subject. He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in 1936, and helped Professor Thomas Laby build up the physics department there.|$|E
5|$|Allen soon {{resumed his}} place in the <b>auger</b> factory in Connecticut, where he {{remained}} until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing augers. The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner’s share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the <b>Auger</b> effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

Before 1104 the father was given the prebend of Cantlers by Maurice, Bishop of London, and the family moved to England.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August, Pash {{received}} a secret message from Washington, D.C., {{reporting that the}} French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L'Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie {{was at the top}} of Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate in the wake of the advancing U.S. Third Army. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre <b>Auger</b> in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired on them, and they had to wait until 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{agreed to}} the proposal, and the Montreal Laboratory was established in a house belonging to McGill University; it moved to permanent accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March 1943. The first eight laboratory staff arrived in Montreal {{at the end of}} 1942. These were Bertrand Goldschmidt and Pierre <b>Auger</b> from France, George Placzek from Czechoslovakia, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, Friedrich Paneth and Hans von Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Canadian contingent included George Volkoff, Bernice Weldon Sargent and George Laurence, and promising young Canadian scientists such as J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E

50|$|Aleus' {{daughter}} <b>Auge,</b> virgin priestess of Athena Alea, {{was made}} pregnant by Heracles, and though Aleus tried {{to dispose of}} mother and child, both {{ended up at the}} court of king Teuthras in Mysia, with <b>Auge</b> his wife (or by some accounts his daughter) and Telephus his adopted heir. According to one account, the Delphic oracle had warned Aleus that if his daughter had a son, then this grandson would kill Aleus' sons, so Aleus made <b>Auge</b> a priestess of Athena, telling her that she must remain a virgin, on pain of death. But Heracles passing through Tegea, became enamored of <b>Auge</b> and while drunk had sex with her. In some accounts, Aleus discovered that <b>Auge</b> was pregnant and gave her to Nauplius to be drowned, but instead Nauplius sold her to Teuthras. Others say that <b>Auge</b> had her baby secretly in the temple of Athena at Tegea and hid it there, but that an ensuing plague and investigation caused her to be found out, so Aleus put <b>Auge</b> and Telephus to sea in a wooden chest and cast them adrift.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{point of}} maximum {{distance}} of a planet from the earth, is denoted by several astronomical terms, most often <b>auge</b> and apogee. The term <b>auge</b> {{was derived from the}} Arab term awj, whose origin, however, is unclear. After 1500, the term <b>auge</b> lost its technical meaning and remains therefore most particularly linked to the history of Ptolemaic astronomy...|$|R
5|$|The factory {{was located}} on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was {{commonly}} used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an <b>auger</b> and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the French {{scientists}} {{wanted to}} go home. <b>Auger</b> had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned {{on a visit to}} London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{for the first time since}} leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. B. W. Sargent then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an {{industrial}} businessman, {{an officer in}} the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the <b>auger</b> and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{successful}} realization of a plasmonic-based heptalayer self-assembled InGaAs quantum-dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) using self-assembled <b>AuGe</b> nanoparticles. In comparison with as-grown device, <b>AuGe</b> detector showed a 30 % increase in spectral response at {{a peak of}} similar to 5 mu m and - 1 V bias. We achieved two-order increment in peak responsivity of <b>AuGe</b> plasmonic-based detector in comparison to as-grown detector at 80 K. The improvements are attributed to increased light trapping in the device and strong plasmonic-QD interaction by the <b>AuGe</b> nanoparticles. In this technique, <b>AuGe</b> nanoparticles are self-assembled; therefore they don't require very fine optical or e-beam lithography for patterning, indicating this technique will be helpful in reducing the cost of plasmonic based high-performance detectors...|$|R

5|$|Placzek became {{head of the}} {{theoretical}} physics division. Kowarski was designated {{to be the head}} of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir Edward Appleton, the permanent secretary of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for James Chadwick. <b>Auger</b> became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist Jules Guéron, who had been working for Free France at Cambridge, and Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian scientist who had worked with Enrico Fermi in Italy before the war.|$|E

The Battle of the Atlantic was still raging, and men and equipment, which {{travelled}} separately, were at risk from German U-boats. The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University. This soon became so crowded that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books. They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March. The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.|$|E
