The RTF formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt. However, as the Australian commitment expanded, by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion-sized battle group consisting of infantry, engineers, cavalry, artillery and logistic elements, usually based on {{a unit of the}} Royal Australian Regiment. Known as the Mentoring Task Force (MTF), it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces. Partnered with the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), it operated throughout Uruzgan Province. While attached to MTF-1, soldiers from Combat Team Delta (based on D Company, 6 RAR) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in Deh Rahwod on 24 August 2010. Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia {{for his role in the}} battle, the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award. The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces, although a small force protection element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and <b>advisory</b> <b>mission.</b> Twelve members of the regiment have been killed in Afghanistan.|$|E

Like traditional moneylenders, supermarkets {{want to make sure}} that this investment is not diverted. However, unlike moneylenders, supermarkets do care about the attributes of the product (form, quality, food safety, etc.). Whether such attributes are present in the harvested product is largely influenced by the advice and the extension services received by the farmer. We built a financial contracting model where we show that supermarkets, choosing to forgo specialization, optimally delegate to a multi-tasking agent both the monitoring and the <b>advisory</b> <b>missions.</b> This contract is shown to potentially enhance credit access for small farmers and sometimes to involve excessive monitoring...|$|R

50|$|Technical Advisory Support (TAS) {{is one of}} {{the prime}} {{activities}} of the UN-SPIDER programme at the national level. It serves to identify the existing capacity to use space-based information, to analyze the institutional framework to support disaster management through spacebased information and to identify the limitations that inhibit the use of such information. TAS attempts to enable Member States to overcome these limitations through international cooperation and regional opportunities, networking with regional institutions, and setting up disaster management plans. It covers region-specific aspects such as trans-boundary issues, emergency response, risk assessment, GIS-based disaster management systems, and disaster-risk reduction. TAS efforts range from a simple consultative phone call to the facilitation of technical support, missions, trainings and workshops. UN-SPIDER's TAS has three pilars: Technical <b>Advisory</b> <b>Missions,</b> Capacity Building and Facilitation of Emergency Support/Technical Support.|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 1915, Sibert, by now a {{lieutenant}} colonel, {{was promoted to}} the rank of brigadier general. This promotion, while not an uncommon practice in the Regular Army of the time, was still unusual. Congress wanted to make Sibert a brigadier general, but the Engineer Corps was only authorized one, so instead of expanding the Corps, they appointed Sibert to a line officer slot (i.e., Infantry). The Army {{not knowing what to do}} with an engineer who had never led troops or trained for combat suddenly elevated to a general of infantry, decided to assign Sibert, who had been working on canal projects in the Mid-West and <b>advisory</b> <b>missions</b> to China, to command the Pacific Coast’s Coastal Artillery.
