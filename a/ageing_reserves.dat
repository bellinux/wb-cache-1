50|$|Chippewa Moraine State Recreation Area is a {{state park}} unit of Wisconsin, USA, {{preserving}} numerous glacial landforms. The abundance and quality of these geological features led to its being included in the Ice <b>Age</b> National Scientific <b>Reserve.</b> The Ice <b>Age</b> National Scenic Trail passes through the park. The park is largely undeveloped, but its modern visitor center serves to interpret the area's geological and biological features. Official documentation alternatively refers to the park as the Chippewa Moraine Ice <b>Age</b> <b>Reserve</b> or the Chippewa Moraine Ice <b>Age</b> National Scientific <b>Reserve.</b> It is located in northwestern Chippewa County.|$|R

50|$|While {{virtually}} all of the pre-existing native forest below altitudes of several thousand feet was removed by sugarcane cultivation, several remnants of native forest can be found. Where the terrain of gulches such as Laupāhoehoe, Ka'awali'i, and Maulua was too steep for cultivation, for example, the original forest remains largely intact. There are also protected areas such as Kalōpā State Recreation Area, which has preserved a small stand of native trees and their understory compatriots.Other protected areas include the Hamakua, Hauola, Manowaialee, and Mauna Kea State Forest Reserves,Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, and Mauna Kea Ice <b>Age</b> <b>Reserve,</b> all on Mauna Kea, and the Mauna Loa Forest Preserve on Mauna Loa.|$|R

It was not until December 1985 that the law was amended so as to remove the draconian punishments for homosexual sex and the age of consent was equalised, when the Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1985 was enacted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Within Cegep classes (17 to 20 {{years of}} <b>age)</b> <b>reserved</b> for {{students}} having previously failed a literature course, {{we examined the}} impact of a rewriting activity on the development of students’ writing skills and their representation of the writing process. This activity was designed to encourage students to reflect on difficulties in their writing in response to individual written feedback provided by a researcher following their first draft. The results of this study show that students’ approach to revising was largely limited to the editing of words and sentence structure. To illustrate this, we discuss two typical cases: the first features a student who has difficulty correcting surface errors through the application of basic rules of language usage; the second focuses on a student whose text production process is limited to a single draft, thus excluding recourse to subsequent planning or revising...|$|R

50|$|The {{source of}} copper could have either been a copper ore (such as malachite), filings from copper ingots, or bronze scrap and other alloys. Prior to the New Kingdom, {{evidence}} is scarce {{as to which}} copper source was being used, but it {{is believed to have}} been copper ores. During the New Kingdom, evidence has been found for the use of copper alloys, such as bronze, due to the presence of varying amounts of tin, arsenic, or lead found in the Egyptian blue material. The presence of tin oxide could have come from copper ores that contained tin oxide and not from the use of bronze. However, no copper ores have been found with these amounts of tin oxide. It is unclear as yet, why there would have been a switch from the use of copper ores in earlier periods, to the use of bronze scrap during the Late Bronze <b>Age.</b> <b>Reserves</b> possibly had run out.|$|R
