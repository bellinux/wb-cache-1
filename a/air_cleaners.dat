25|$|Production at Citroën's {{plant in}} Slough, England was from 1953 to 1960. Until then British Construction and Use Regulations made cars with inboard front brakes {{such as the}} 2CV illegal. Producing the car in Britain allowed Citroën to {{circumvent}} trade barriers and to sell cars in the British Empire and Commonwealth. It achieved some success in these markets, {{to the extent that}} all Slough-built 2CVs were fitted with improved <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> and other modifications to suit the rough conditions found in Australia and Africa, where the 2CV's durability and good ride quality over rough roads attracted buyers. The 2CV sold poorly in Great Britain in part due to its excessive cost, because of import duties on components.|$|E

2500|$|Chevrolet {{specifications}} {{included both}} [...] "gross" [...] and [...] "net" [...] horsepower figures in 1971, {{which was a}} year before the industry wide transition to SAE net horsepower figures. SAE net horsepower standardized horsepower ratings in accord with SAE standard J1349 figures to get a more accurate horsepower figure. [...] "Net" [...] horsepower was measured [...] "as installed" [...] in a vehicle with power using accessories and emission equipment installed, exhaust systems, and <b>air</b> <b>cleaners,</b> leading to lower power ratings. For 1971, the 400 Turbo-Jet engine was rated at 300 gross horsepower with and without dual exhaust, while the more accurate net figures show it rated at [...] with single exhaust and 260 with dual exhaust. Beginning in 1972, automakers would follow SAE standard J1349 and the [...] "net" [...] horsepower ratings were the only advertised ratings.|$|E
2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two <b>air</b> <b>cleaners,</b> throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is new on the exhaust cams which broadens the torque curve. The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with main bearing caps reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270). The engine now sits 15mm lower in the chassis for a lower center of gravity.|$|E
50|$|Polarized-media {{electronic}} <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> use active electronically enhanced {{media to}} combine {{elements of both}} electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> and passive mechanical filters. Most polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> convert 24-volt current to safe DC voltage to establish the polarized electric field. Airborne particles become polarized as they pass through the electric field and adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.|$|E
40|$|Dental {{healthcare}} workers (DHCWs) are at {{high risk}} of occupational exposure to droplets and aerosol particles emitted from patients' mouths during treatment. We evaluated the effectiveness of an <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> in reducing droplet and aerosol contamination by positioning the device in four different locations in an actual dental clinic. We applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to solve the governing equations of airflow, energy and dispersion of different-sized airborne droplets/aerosol particles. In a dental clinic, we measured the supply air velocity and temperature of the ventilation system, the airflow rate and the particle removal efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to determine the boundary conditions for the CFD simulations. Our results indicate that use of an <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> in a dental clinic may be an effective method for reducing DHCWs' exposure to airborne droplets and aerosol particles. Further, we found that the probability of droplet/aerosol particle removal and the direction of airflow from the cleaner are both important control measures for droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental clinic. Thus, the distance between the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> and droplet/aerosol particle source as well as the relative location of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to both the source and the DHCW are important considerations for reducing DHCWs' exposure to droplets/aerosol particles emitted from the patient's mouth during treatments...|$|R

40|$|Air {{intake system}} (AIS) plays an {{important}} role on affecting the performance of the engine and the vehicle. The design and optimization of the structures and materials of AIS contributes to producing a quality reliable system, reducing noise, cost and weight at the same time, which are significant to improve the performance of engine and vehicle. Fresh air hoses/pipes are intended to transport, in <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> purified, <b>air</b> from the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to the throttle fitted on the inlet manifold or to the compressor fitted to the exhaust manifold. <b>Air</b> <b>cleaner</b> box is responsible for filtering out the dust and impurities in the air. The charge air pipes are intended to transport purified compressed air from the compressor to the charge air cooler and then to the throttle fitted on the inlet pipe. For the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> box optimization, through the benchmarking and the innovation ideas from the daily life, two alternative optimized designs were introduced to reduce the cost and weight. The first is four clips connectors and the other is spring clamps. For the hose clamps, another innovation design was introduced to replace the previous hose clamps, which is called friction connector on the inner side of the bellow hose, the outer side of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> box lid and the clean side duct. For the material of the charge air ducts, TPEE was selected to replace the previous EACM rubber hoses. Further tests and prototypes should be conducted and produced to verify the effect of the optimization...|$|R
