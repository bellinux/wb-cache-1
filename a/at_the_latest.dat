5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E

5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated objects were a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, which suggests that the Heilongjiang hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} forms a species pair with the Eurasian white-tailed eagle. This species pair {{consists}} of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles {{at the beginning of}} the Early Miocene (c. 10Ma BP) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.|$|E
5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of chlorophyll, soluble sugars, soluble proteins and thiobarbituric acid reaction substance (TBARS), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, net photosynthetic rate {{as well as}} the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) of flag leaves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stages were studied by using C Liangyou series of hybrid rice combinitions as material and Shanyou 63 as control. The C Liangyou series of hybrid rice combinations used in the experiment included C Liangyou 396, C Liangyou 87, C Liangyou 755 and C Liangyou 34, which all used C 815 S as male sterile line. The {{contents of}} chlorophyll, soluble sugars and soluble proteins in flag leaves of the C Liangyou series combinations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stages were higher than those of the control, whereas the TBARS content was lower than that of the control. The activities of SOD and POD were significantly higher than those of the control on the 7 th day after heading, and then decreased slowly. FPSII value and qP value of flag leaves decreased <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stages, and these two parameters in flag leaves of the C Liangyou series combinations were higher than those of the control, while the qN value increased <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stages and was lower than that of the control. The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stage was higher compared with the control. These results suggest that slow senescence and strong photosynthetic capability in flag leaves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> growth stages are the physiological basis of the C Liangyou series combinations...|$|R

5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 of them were raised {{in the province of}} Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> by 1125.|$|E

5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to HenryV's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 {{as part of her}} dower to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle between then and {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|E

Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Jænberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765, at {{the court}} of King Offa of Mercia; this {{location}} implies that his election was acceptable to the king. In 766, he received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Jænberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom. In 780 and 781, Jænberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, Jænberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the Battle of Otford, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.|$|E
5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the {{reclaimed}} part of the church {{under the direction of}} Papal Nuncio John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building {{by the end of the}} year <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.|$|E
40|$|Mutation {{in several}} {{different}} cistrons of bacteriophage phi chi 174 blocks net progeny single-stranded DNA synthesis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> period of infection (15). For {{the study of the}} functions of these cistrons in single-stranded DNA synthesis, asymmetric replication of replicative form DNA was examined <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> period of infection with amber mutants of these cistrons. While the normal, rapid process of asymmetric single-stranded viral DNA synthesis is blocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> period of these mutant infections, an asymmetric synthesis of the viral strand of replicative-form DNA is observed in this period, though at a reduced level, together with degradation of prelabeled viral strand. Some intermediate replicative-form molecules were also detected. Asymmetric synthesis of the viral strand of replicative-form DNA <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> period of phi chi infection is completely inhibited {{in the presence of a}} low concentration (35 mug/ml) of chloramphenicol (which also blocks net single-stranded viral DNA synthesis). These results are discussed in terms of the possible role of the specific viral proteins for normal single-stranded DNA synthesis...|$|R

5|$|The 400-year period {{following}} {{the collapse of}} Roman rule {{is the most difficult}} to interpret in the history of Wales. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples. Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades, some previously maintained that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that much of the population has, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic, or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E
