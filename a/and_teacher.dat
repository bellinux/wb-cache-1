40|$|This study {{investigated}} parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> {{views of the}} completion and importance of social and cognitive early learning activities and learning outcomes {{by the end of}} JK. A mixed methods approach, including questionnaires and interviews, was incorporated.

Specifically, parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> differed about early learning activities involving computer and workbook use, the development of self-regulation, socialization, reading books, and encouraging independence. Both parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> valued activities that promoted socialization, reading, and independence; however, parents believed socialization, <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> believed reading <b>and</b> independence to be of greater importance. Parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> also differed about JK learning outcomes involving academic skills, independence, and self-regulation with parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> valuing social skill development as being important.

40|$|Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among {{adolescents}} {{is a significant}} problem, yet the majority do not seek professional help.

This study explored what adolescents believe parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> {{can do to help}} young people who self-injure. A school-based sample of 2637 students (aged 12 - 18 years) completed a self-report questionnaire. Adolescents believe having non-judgemental parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to talk to, improved parent-child relationships, referral to professionals, reduced school pressures, and student education, are pivotal to helping young self-injurers. However, many adolescents, particularly those exposed to NSSI, were unsure about whether parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> could do anything to help. These finding have important implications for educational programs that prepare parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to address adolescent NSSI...|$|R

His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} factors that have influenced decisions made by principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to initiate multi-age classrooms in the United States. A descriptive research design was utilized for the {{purpose of this}} study. Principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> who had implemented multi-age programs were mailed a questionnaire. Three hundred fifty-seven principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> responded. Data were collected and analyzed to determine if principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> differed in their perception of the factors that may have influenced the selection of multi-age classrooms. Five statistical tests were used to evaluate the hypotheses. An alpha level of. 05 was used for hypothesis testing. Statistical analyses revealed that principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> held the same level of perception about the selection factors of retention, student achievement, social development and developmentally appropriate practices, regardless of their school size or its location. Principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> rated each selection factor as important; however, social development and developmentally appropriate practices were rated higher than retention and academic achievement. Principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> should not expect this organizational and structural method alone to solve all of the educational problems of today.
