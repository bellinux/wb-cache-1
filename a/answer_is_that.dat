25|$|The reader {{may wonder}} why a {{competent}} scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation {{by taking the}} time to undertake such a thankless task.|$|E
25|$|One might ask, {{since the}} {{homogeneous}} polynomials {{are not really}} functions on P(V), what are they, geometrically speaking? The algebro-geometric <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are sections of a sheaf (one could also say a line bundle in this case). The situation with modular forms is precisely analogous.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the notice is to alert all {{creditors}} of the intended application, in case they should wish to oppose it. It follows that the notice must be published in a newspaper in the usual sense. What if the newspaper was published in Hebrew and was devoted only to Jewish interests, as in Ex parte Goldman? The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this would not suffice. The newspaper must be one which caters to general interests.|$|E
6000|$|His <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> {{when the}} ostrich asked the deer {{what he would}} advise him {{to do when the}} hunters appeared, the deer's reply was, [...] "Run away." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also tried}} to get Pitt to reveal what was the [...] "insurmountable obstacle" [...] he mentioned, but Pitt's only <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "further {{explanation}} or discussion can answer no good purpose".|$|R
60|$|All she {{attempted}} to <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> welcome to her lands, so they would leave her person free; her vows were not to man, but to God, and God would protect her.|$|R
25|$|One might inquire why {{the contact}} {{potential}} {{does not appear}} in Kirchhoff's law of voltages as one contribution to the sum of potential drops. The customary <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any circuit involves not only a particular diode or junction, but also all the contact potentials due to wiring and so forth around the entire circuit. The sum of all the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff's law.|$|E
25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a bit to spare.|$|E
25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should be proud to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E
50|$|Beginning life as HeliumKnowledge.com, Helium.com was {{launched}} in October 2006. Its original format was similar to Yahoo! Answers, with contributors answering questions with short, informative answers (the minimum word count was 100 words). The key difference to Yahoo! <b>Answers</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> ranked ('rated') by fellow members according to the value {{and quality of the}} information.|$|R
60|$|At length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, {{pointing}} to myself, {{a small and}} stubbly-haired youth with a sharp nose, asked my father whether he would like me to be instructed in the French tongue. The <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> nothing would please him better.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} four or five places he visited, the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no such party had arrived; then, seeing one of the civic guards, he {{asked him if he}} had seen or heard of a troop of men passing through the town.|$|R
25|$|Examples of {{historic}} Sunni scholars who permitted the Mawlid include the Shafi'i scholar Al-Suyuti (d 911 A.H.) who stated that:My <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the legal status}} of the observance of the Mawlid – as long as it just consists of a meeting together by the people, a recitation of apposite parts of the Qur'an, the recounting of transmitted accounts of the beginning of (the biography of) the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and the wonders that took place during his birth, all of which is then followed by a banquet that is served to them and from which they eat-is a good innovation (bid'a hasana), for which one is rewarded because of the esteem shown for the position of the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – that is implicit in it, and because of the expression of joy and happiness on his – may God bless him and grant him peace – noble birth.|$|E
500|$|According to Ohlin (op. cit., p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, then, is {{the height of the}} interest rate determined. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the {{question}} is why didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky believed that the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E

60|$|His {{guardian}} angel, however, {{was very}} good to Tommy at this time; or perhaps, like cannibals with their prisoner, the god of sentiment (who has a tail) was fattening him for a future feast; and Mrs. Jerry's <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it could never be.|$|R
40|$|The 1966 science-fction film Fantastic Voyage {{captured}} the public imagination with a clever idea: what fantastic things might {{we see and}} do if we could minaturize ourselves and travel through the bloodstream as corpuscles do? (This being Hollywood, the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we'd save a fellow scientist from evildoers. ...|$|R
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|This leads Hazlitt to {{consider}} why, when Falstaff [...] "is {{represented as a}} liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc., [...] we are not offended but delighted with him [...]" [...] The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "he is all these as much to amuse others as to gratify himself. He openly assumes all these characters to shew the humourous part of them. The unrestrained indulgence of his own ease, appetites, and convenience, has neither malice nor hypocrisy in it. In a word, he is an actor in himself {{almost as much as}} upon the stage, and we no more object to the character of Falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think of bringing an excellent comedian, who should represent him to the life, before one of the police offices." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} given <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we attribute consciousness {{to other people}} because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E
60|$|So good Sir Robert {{went up to}} him, {{and spoke}} kindly and hopefully. But all Hereward <b>answered</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> very well. <b>That</b> he wanted nothing. That he had always heard well of Sir Robert. That he should {{like to get a}} little sleep: but that sleep would not come.|$|R
50|$|But {{what about}} the {{nationality}} of the autonomists? Maylender defined the “Fiuman nationality” as a specific nationality: if Fiumans had to change their nationality accordingly to their sovereigns they would have changed at least 7 nationalities since 1509: his <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no one fitted perfectly to them, thus they were a national.|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{questions}} needing <b>answers</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of {{a colony of}} flying manta rays—the principal [...] "animute" [...] inhabiting the reservoir. Although the government is aware of their existence, of chief concern at the story's outset is the origin of their mutation, {{as well as the}} importance of keeping the creatures a secret.|$|R
500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was obliged}} to read it because {{everybody}} was asking me about it. My <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Dan Brown {{is one of the}} characters in my novel Foucault's Pendulum, which is about people who start believing in occult stuff.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} seen, but {{the effects are}} tiny. The reason is that {{planetary}} velocities are extremely small compared to the speed of light, so that for planets and satellites of the solar system, the [...] term dwarfs the spatial terms.|$|E
2500|$|Yusuf {{was asked}} by the Swiss {{periodical}} Das Magazin why the title of the album was An Other Cup, rather than [...] "Another Cup". The <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his breakthrough album, Tea for the Tillerman in 1970, was decorated with Yusuf's painting of a peasant sitting down to a cup of steaming drink on the land. He commented that the two worlds [...] "then, and now, are very different". His new album shows a steaming cup alone on this cover. His <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> actually an other cup; something different; a bridge between the East and West, which he explained was his own perceived role. He added that, through him, [...] "Westerners might get a glimpse of the East, and Easterners, some understanding of the West. The cup, too, is important; it's a meeting place, a thing meant to be shared." ...|$|R
25|$|When Franz Joseph {{received}} the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she had committed suicide. It {{was only when}} a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> relieved of <b>that</b> notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> whatever procedures <b>were</b> prescribed by Swiss Law should be adhered to.|$|R
6000|$|Mr Verloc intimated hoarsely <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> in {{the habit}} of reading the daily papers. To a further {{question}} his <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> of course, he understood what he read.

2500|$|Kyle steals {{the laptop}} {{containing}} Pat's diary {{and tries to}} coerce Pat into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files.

2500|$|Overall, Hauerwas {{believes}} that America is not courageous {{because it does}} not act out of charity. He {{believes that}} the church can do it, but he questions whether America as a whole is able to. His <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it cannot. “We in America have lost our moral vision precisely as we have lost our courage to fight for what is right and good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swygert {{wrote for}} himself and Flaum. He {{rejected}} Schmuck's attack on the conviction, citing the circuit's recent holding in Galloway(a decision from which he himself had dissented) and declining to overrule it. As for the alleged due-process violation, he continued, [...] "ne <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he can prevent the mailing by abstaining from the fraud." [...] Galloway and the cases on which it rested had also found no due-process violation.|$|E
60|$|Crœsus was really, as {{the most}} {{unlikely}} thing to be guessed, boiling a tortoise and a lamb together in a brazen vessel. Sure now of {{the truth of the}} oracle, he sent splendid gifts, and asked whether he should go to war with Cyrus. The <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> if he did, a mighty kingdom would be overthrown.|$|R
60|$|Mr. William {{followed}} Pacifico {{as he went}} out, {{in order}} to speak a moment {{to a friend of}} his who occupied the next apartment.
