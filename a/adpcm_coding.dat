50|$|G.722 is an ITU-T {{standard}} wideband speech codec {{operating at}} 48, 56 and 64 kbit/s, based on subband coding with two channels and <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding</b> of each. Before the digitization process, it catches the analog signal and divides it in frequency bands with QMF filters (quadrature mirror filters) {{to get two}} subbands of the signal. When the ADPCM bitstream of each subband is obtained, the results are multiplexed and {{the next step is}} storage or transmission of the data. The decoder has to perform the reverse process, that is, demultiplex and decode each subband of the bitstream and recombine them.|$|E
40|$|Efficient digital {{transmission}} of speech requires source coding which {{comes at the}} price of unavoidable quantization errors. Thus, even in clear channel conditions, the quality of the decoded speech signal is limited due to the quanti-zation errors. Hybrid Digital-Analog (HDA) codes circum-vent this limitation by additionally transmitting the quanti-zation error with quasi-analog methods (discrete-time, quasi-continuous-amplitude) with neither increasing the total trans-mission power, nor the occupied frequency bandwidth on the radio channel. So far, the HDA concept has mainly been ap-plied to random parameters. In this paper, the HDA concept is adapted to the transmission of wideband speech signals using PCM and <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding.</b> By experimental verification it is shown that the HDA concept may outperform conventional purely {{digital transmission}} systems at all channel qualities while additionally eliminating the quality saturation effect.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a flow based on the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) for mapping pipelined {{applications}} on a heterogeneous multiprocessor platform on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with customizable processors. BOA is a Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA) that, substituting the classical mutation and crossover operators with the construction and the sampling of a Bayesian network, is able to identify correlated sub-structures within the problem to be maintained while generating new solutions. The paper introduces the model adopted for pipelined applications and then shows why BOA fits the problem better than other search algorithms, like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Tabu Search (TS). We also show that our algorithm is able to cope with data parallel pipelined algorithms. We finally validate our flow on realistic applications like JPEG and <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding</b> by executing the resulting mapping on our platform...|$|E

30|$|This {{work has}} {{conducted}} some case studies {{to evaluate the}} proposed estimation methods. The case studies consist of (i) Motorola's Powerstone benchmark suite <b>codes</b> (<b>adpcm,</b> bcnt, and fdct), (ii) common search/ordering/signal processing algorithms (binarysearch, bubblesort, and convolution), (iii) a customized example, and (iv) a real-world biomedical application (a pulse oximeter). The pulse oximeter case study is composed of three concurrent tasks; hence it has been divided into three separate experiments. All experiments were performed on an Intel Core 2 Duo 1.67 [*]GHz, 2 [*]Gb RAM, and Windows Vista OS.|$|R
40|$|Congestion in a {{wireless}} sensor network causes {{an increase in the}} amount of data loss and delays in data transmission. In this paper, we propose a new congestion control technique (ACT, Adaptive Compression-based congestion control Technique) based on an adaptive compression scheme for packet reduction in case of congestion. The compression techniques used in the ACT are Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Adaptive Differential Pulse <b>Code</b> Modulation (<b>ADPCM),</b> and Run-Length <b>Coding</b> (RLC). The ACT first transforms the data from the time domain to the frequency domain, reduces the range of data by using ADPCM, and then reduces the number of packets with the help of RLC before transferring the data to the source node. It introduces the DWT for priority-based congestion control because the DWT classifies the data into four groups with different frequencies. The ACT assigns priorities to these data groups in an inverse proportion to the respective frequencies of the data groups and defines the quantization step size of ADPCM in an inverse proportion to the priorities. RLC generates a smaller number of packets for a data group with a low priority. In the relaying node, the ACT reduces the amount of packets by increasing the quantization step size of ADPCM in case of congestion. Moreover, in order to facilitate the back pressure, the queue is controlled adaptively according to the congestion state. We experimentally demonstrate that the ACT increases the network efficiency and guarantees fairness to sensor nodes, as compared with the existing methods. Moreover, it exhibits a very high ratio of the available data in the sink...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{auditory}} {{quality of}} the speech signal produced by a text-to-speech (TTS) system depends on different factors which may be ascribed to different components of the synthesis system. During {{the development of the}} Dresden Speech Synthesizer DRESS, the authors investigated the influence of different system components separately. The results of these investigations are summarized and updated in this paper. In a recent application study, the authors were forced to select and to adapt system components for achieving a total system footprint less than 1 Megabyte (MB). The resulting scaleable low-resource system was denoted as microDRESS. The auditory comparison of microDRESS to the baseline system DRESS implies that the inventory coding has the most essential influence on both, system size and auditory quality. For the applied <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding</b> scheme, the measured degradation of approximately one category on the mean opinion scale (MOS) is caused less by the coding algorithm itself but mainly by the limitation to telephone bandwidth. Allowing more system resources, there are interesting options for the TTS system configuration to achieve best-possible overall quality which are discussed in the paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an adaptive multi rate wideband (AMR-WB) speech codec {{proposed for the}} GSM system and also for the evolving Third Generation (3 G) mobile speech services. The coder is a multi rate SB-CELP (Subband-Code-Excited Linear Prediction) with five modes operating at bit rates from 24 kbit/s down to 9. 1 kbit/s. Our basic approach consists of an unequal bandsplitting of the input signal into two subbands (SB). A variable rate, multi-mode ACELP coder {{is applied to the}} lower subband (0 - 6 kHz). The various bit rates are integrated in a common structure where the scalability is realized by exchanging the fixed excitation codebooks while leaving all other codec parameters invariant. For the GSM re-lated modes (9. 1 - 17. 8 kbit/s), the upper subband (6 - 7 kHz) is coded using a very low bit rate representation based on bandwidth expansion techniques. In case of the 3 G application (24 kbit/s) the upper band is coded using a 4 kbit/s <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding</b> scheme. In addition the analysis by synthesis (AbS) coder of the lower band employs a novel closed loop gain re-quantization technique controlled by the character of the speech signal. Thereby the codec achieves an enhanced performance for background noise while maintaining its clean speech quality. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} paid to the use of nonlinear filters in speech processing to exploit the nonlinear properties of speech signals. Although polynomial filters based on Volterra series are utilizable nonlinear systems they have received little attention in coding. That is the objective of our research partly reported in this paper. Here, the <b>ADPCM</b> <b>coding</b> technique with nonlinear prediction based on quadratic Volterra filters is examined using backward prediction schemes based on LMS and RLS algorithms. Utilizing backward adaptive quadratic filters in ADPCM based speech coding, by itself, does not result in an overall improvement in the quality of reconstructed signal in comparison with a linear scheme using the same bit rate. However, it is shown that a scheme can be developed in which, for each frame of constant length, a set of quadratic filters with different memory sizes is examined and the nonlinear filter resulting in best improved quality is decided on. The identifying code of the selected filter is sent to the decoder along with the quantized residual signals. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme results in a good improvement (up to 2 dB) in the overall quality of the reconstructed speech signal. This improvement is achieved at the cost of a slight increase in the bit rate and a small delay...|$|E
