500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer you have to <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's probably not going to be very good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} the impact Marina Bay, a Russian astrologer, sued NASA for $300million for the impact which [...] "ruin the natural balance of forces in the universe." [...] Her lawyer asked the public to {{volunteer}} {{to help in the}} claim by declaring [...] "The impact changed the magnetic properties of the comet, and this could have affected mobile telephony here on Earth. If your phone went down this morning, <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> Why? and then get in touch with us." [...] On August 9, 2005 the Presnensky Court of Moscow ruled against Bay, although she did attempt to appeal the result. One Russian physicist said that the impact had no effect on Earth and [...] "the change to the orbit of the comet after the collision was only about 10cm (3.9in)." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2007 The Washington Post {{reported}} Katherine Wone's {{frustration with}} the FBI crime lab, [...] "It has been trying at times {{as we continue to}} wait for the FBI to complete their analysis of all the samples that were taken." [...] Over one year the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it [...] "vagabond status" [...] in the U.S. Attorneys' office. On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the killer, her first public comment on the case. During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying [...] "You need to <b>ask</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Have I provided police with all the information I know?'" [...] Interested parties, such as the OCA, used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed police inaction in the investigation. In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it {{ran out of gas}} on its way to victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? You have to <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E

500|$|... "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] is a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. It {{contains}} sample of the recording [...] "Sabali" [...] which is written by Damon Albarn, Mariam Doumbia and Marc A. Moreau published by Chrysalis Music. [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] starts with [...] "crooning by a chipmunk-like voice", and after that Levine professes [...] "I’m here to wipe your eyes" [...] to his broken-hearted romantic interest. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse criticized {{the opening of the}} song labeling it as [...] "jarring nonsensical sounds"; the sounds can also be heard in the background. However, according to her, [...] "they're minor issues with an album that is bound to get at least one song other than 'Payphone' stuck in your head." [...] Alt Rock Live's Keaton Fletcher in a review of Overexposed, wrote that the beginning of the song makes you <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> [...] "do you really want to listen to this song?" [...] However, he concluded that after its first thirty seconds it sounds like typical Maroon 5 song on which you feel smooth sexuality. A reviewer of Kiss 95.1 radio wrote that [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] together with [...] "Love Somebody" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Goodbye" [...] "are 'fan favorites' songs".|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to <b>ask</b> <b>yourself,</b> in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
2500|$|One critic, Allegheny County Democratic Chairman Jim Burn, {{said that}} ”Her record speaks for itself. I've seen {{a long line}} of Democrats and {{mistakes}} aren't made based on party affiliation but I haven't seen anybody from the other side going though that system." [...] Burn pointed to the fact that Buchanan’s Office refused to investigate former Republican Senator Rick Santorum, who got a tuition reimbursement for his children by claiming a Penn Hills, Pennsylvania residency while his family spent most of its time in Virginia, as an example of an alleged double standard. [...] "You have to <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> the misrepresentations of a Republican such as Rick Santorum made about his alleged residency in Penn Hills were significant," [...] said Burn.|$|E

[...] On {{the advice of his}} gallery, Cartrain handed over the artworks to DACS and forfeited the £200 he had made; he said, [...] "I met Christian Zimmermann [...] who told me Hirst personally ordered action on the matter."

2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary.
