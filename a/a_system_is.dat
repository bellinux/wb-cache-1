5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{more than the sum}} of its parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{designated}} as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots (50km/h, 32mph). Should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots (65km/h, 40mph) {{then it will be}} classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the Sub Regional Center in Mauritius or Madagascar. No matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin, it is always {{designated as}} a subtropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{when the}} primary purpose of <b>a</b> <b>systems</b> {{engineer}} <b>is</b> to comprehend a complex problem, graphic representations of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> used to communicate <b>a</b> <b>system's</b> functional and data requirements. Common graphical representations include: ...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} Axiom <b>A</b> <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> their structural stability against small perturbations. That is, trajectories of the perturbed system remain in 1-1 topological correspondence with the unperturbed <b>system.</b> This property <b>is</b> important, {{in that it}} shows that Axiom <b>A</b> <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> not exceptional, but are in a sense 'generic'.|$|R
50|$|Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} by Raghuram Rajan in January 2008.|$|R
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E

50|$|In the {{security}} engineering subspecialty of computer science, <b>a</b> trusted <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that <b>is</b> relied upon to a specified extent {{to enforce a}} specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that <b>a</b> trusted <b>system</b> <b>is</b> one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted <b>system</b> <b>is</b> trusted to enforce).|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> {{nonlinear}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that <b>is</b> not linear—i.e., <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{that does}} not satisfy the superposition principle. Less technically, <b>a</b> nonlinear <b>system</b> <b>is</b> any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. <b>A</b> nonhomogeneous <b>system,</b> which <b>is</b> linear apart from {{the presence of a}} function of the independent variables, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to <b>a</b> linear <b>system</b> as long as a particular solution is known.|$|R
25|$|Usually, {{a system}} with more {{equations}} than unknowns has no solution. Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> also known as an overdetermined system.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> one {{in which}} the volume, number of molecules, and {{internal}} energy are fixed (the microcanonical ensemble).|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{a system}} with fewer {{equations}} than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> known as an underdetermined system.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} not an {{objective}} property of <b>an</b> individual <b>system</b> but <b>is</b> that information, obtained from a knowledge of how <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> prepared, {{which can be used}} for making predictions about future measurements.|$|R
50|$|IEC 61499 enables an application-centric design, {{in which}} one or more applications, defined by {{networks}} of interconnected function blocks, are created for the whole system and subsequently distributed to the available devices. All devices within <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> described within <b>a</b> device model. The topology of the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> reflected by the system model. The distribution of an application is described within the mapping model. Therefore, applications of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> distributable but maintained together.|$|R
50|$|A key concept under realism is the {{international}} distribution of power referred to as system polarity. Polarity refers {{to the number of}} blocs of states that exert power in <b>an</b> international <b>system.</b> <b>A</b> multipolar <b>system</b> <b>is</b> composed of three or more blocs, <b>a</b> bipolar <b>system</b> <b>is</b> composed of two blocs, and <b>a</b> unipolar <b>system</b> <b>is</b> dominated by <b>a</b> single power or hegemon.|$|R
25|$|As of 2017 <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> marketed by Terumo in Europe {{that is used}} {{to remove}} {{pathogens}} from blood; donated blood is treated with riboflavin and then with ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> an {{integrated}} composite that consists or {{one or more}} of the processes, hardware, software, facilities and people that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objective (definition by ISO/IEC 12207).|$|E
25|$|Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{called a}} maximum-phase system {{because it has}} the maximum group delay of the set of systems that have the same {{magnitude}} response. In this set of equal-magnitude-response systems, the maximum phase system will have maximum energy delay.|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> sensing <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{presented}} {{which includes}} a pulse-modulated light-emitting diode (LED) and an all-fibre-optic loop generating a reference signal in the time domain. The basic principle of operation and parameters are introduced, and some properties of such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> experimentally examined using a microbend sensor...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{cultural}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{the interaction}} of different elements of culture. While <b>a</b> cultural <b>system</b> <b>is</b> quite different from <b>a</b> social <b>system,</b> sometimes both <b>systems</b> together <b>are</b> {{referred to as the}} sociocultural system.|$|R
50|$|In {{explicit}} symmetry breaking, {{the equations}} of motion describing <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> variant under the broken symmetry.|$|R
25|$|Parametric {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter.|$|E
25|$|It is as {{important}} to decide what <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> not as to decide what it is. Do not serve all the world's needs; rather, make the system extensible so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.|$|E
25|$|A rare type {{of complex}} binary {{azeotrope}} {{is one where}} the boiling point and condensation point curves touch at two points in the phase diagram. Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> called a double azeotrope, and will have two azeotropic compositions and boiling points. An example is water and N-methylethylenediamine.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> duct <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{also called}} ductwork. Planning (laying out), sizing, optimizing, detailing, {{and finding the}} {{pressure}} losses through <b>a</b> duct <b>system</b> <b>is</b> called duct design.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> free <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{material}} <b>system</b> which <b>is</b> {{subject to}} no other than internal and normal connections.|$|R
25|$|The {{benefit of}} such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> that the helium {{delivery}} tank pressure {{need not be}} as high as that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be 'topped up' to best mix after the dive. This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes (e.g., in irrigated, {{submerged}} rice fields), a form {{of temporary}} drainage is required whereby the drainage system is allowed to function only on certain occasions (e.g., during the harvest period). If allowed to function continuously, excessive quantities of water would be lost. Such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> therefore called a checked, or controlled, drainage system.|$|E
25|$|Further the {{keyboard}} size {{depends on the}} extent to which <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> used where a single action is produced by a combination of subsequent or simultaneous keystrokes (with modifier keys, see below), or multiple pressing of a single key. A keyboard with few keys is called a keypad. See also text entry interface.|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} <b>system</b> {{elements of}} <b>an</b> optical imaging <b>system</b> <b>are</b> identified and <b>a</b> method for an initial assessment of <b>system</b> performance <b>is</b> presented. <b>A</b> generalized imaging <b>system</b> <b>is</b> defined. <b>A</b> <b>system</b> analysis <b>is</b> considered, {{followed by a}} component analysis. An example of the method is given using <b>a</b> film imaging <b>system...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{critical}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{which must}} <b>be</b> highly reliable and retain this reliability as they evolve without incurring prohibitive costs.|$|R
50|$|In control theory, {{observability}} is {{a measure}} of how well internal states of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> can <b>be</b> inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> mathematical duals. The concept of observability was introduced by Hungarian-American engineer Rudolf E. Kálmán for linear dynamic systems.|$|R
