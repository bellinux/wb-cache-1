40|$|Problem: Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{significant}} problems in patients being treated with antipsychotic medications. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, affecting over 72 million adults (Ogden, Carroll, McDowell, & Flegal, 2007). Obesity related conditions or metabolic syndrome include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and {{certain types of}} cancer {{are some of the}} leading cause of preventable death (CDC, 2013; Park, Usher & Foster, 2011). Design: quasi-experimental. Purpose: The purpose of this project was to implement an evidence-based educational program in a behavioral health setting with an overall goal of decreasing weight gain in patients who are prescribed <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines.</b> Methods: <b>A</b> 12 week-long program was designed for people who are prescribed <b>a</b> regimen of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines.</b> The program included guidelines for regular exercise and diet, along with a weekly 1 -hour session of dietary and exercise education. There were 7 participants {{at the beginning of the}} program; 5 completed the program. A pre- and post-program questionnaire was administered to assess attitudes and behaviors about eating. Findings: Participants experienced statistically significant weight reduction (P=. 043). There were no statistical differences on the participants’ waist circumference and BMI. Inconsistent attendance may have negatively impacted the results. However, the results were effective in showing no weight gain among all participants. Conclusion: An educational program to help prevent weight gain induced by antipsychotic medication can be impactful to the health care system...|$|R

40|$|Objective : The aim of {{this article}} is to present a current {{discussion}} related to the nursing care of clients treated with atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines</b> and who have a risk of developing metabolic instability and/or Type 2 diabetes. The importance of such a discussion is to provide both the novice and the experienced nurse with additional knowledge of this current health issue with which to inform their nursing practice. Discussion : The potential for psychosis to be a chronic condition is very high, and often people require <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicine</b> for lengthy periods throughout their lives. Sometimes, treatment is for life. The second generation of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines</b> was greeted with much enthusiasm since it was better tolerated than the first generation. However, each medication has desired and adverse effects and, when taken for lengthy periods, these effects may produce physical illness. Studies show that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in clients with a chronic psychiatric disorder, particularly schizophrenia. Conclusions : Metabolic instability, especially weight gain, is associated with some psychotropic medicines. Nursing interventions need to include care assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation for clients treated with <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines</b> in terms of risk minimization strategies in routine nursing care. <br /...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} impacts of {{pharmaceutical}} sector policies implemented to contain country spending during the economic recession [...] a reference price system in Finland and a mix of policies including changes in reimbursement rates, a generic promotion campaign and discounts granted to the public payer in Portugal - on utilization of, {{as a proxy for}} access to, <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines.</b> METHODOLOGY: We obtained monthly IMS Health sales data in standard units of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines</b> in Portugal and Finland for the period January 2007 to December 2011. We used an interrupted time series design to estimate changes in overall use and generic market shares by comparing pre-policy and post-policy levels and trends. RESULTS: Both countries' policy approaches were associated with slight, likely unintended, decreases in overall use of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>medicines</b> and with increases in generic market shares of major antipsychotic products. In Finland, quetiapine and risperidone generic market shares increased substantially (estimates one year post-policy compared to before, quetiapine: 6. 80 % [3. 92 %, 9. 68 %]; risperidone: 11. 13 % [6. 79 %, 15. 48 %]. The policy interventions in Portugal resulted in a substantially increased generic market share for amisulpride (estimate one year post-policy compared to before: 22. 95 % [21. 01 %, 24. 90 %]; generic risperidone already dominated the market prior to the policy interventions.

40|$|Background: Schizophrenia is {{a costly}} illness to treat, {{especially}} {{during a time}} of escalating medicine inflation costs, putting a large economic strain on patients, their families and the community. Treatment, however, can become more affordable through generic substitution. Objective: To determine the maximum potential cost-saving through generic substitution for both originator and more expensive generic items while observing the prescribing patterns of <b>antipsychotics.</b> Method: <b>Antipsychotic</b> <b>medicine</b> usage was analysed retrospectively during the study period 2008 to 2013 using data obtained from a nationally representative Pharmaceutical Benefit Management Company. The study population consisted of 4410 patients with ICD- 10 codes (F 20 -F 20. 9) who had paid claims for <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> reimbursed from their prescribed minimum benefits. Active ingredients were identified using the MIMS classification system. Maximum potential cost savings were determined by substituting all originator and more expensive generic antipsychotic items with the cost of the least expensive generic antipsychotic item available. Results: Through generic substitution, a total potential cost-saving of ZAR 4 642   685. 45 could be possible from 2008 to 2013. Average cost per items increased from ZAR 600. 53  ± ZAR 435. 00 (median ZAR 539. 82) in 2008 to ZAR 1 196. 59  ± ZAR 942. 16 (median ZAR 940. 72) in 2013 and had a significant effect on patients' contribution, which increased with 726. 94 % from 2005 to 2008. Psychiatrists prescribed the majority of antipsychotics. Although generic items claimed increased by 60. 31 % during the study period, psychiatrists still favoured non-generic prescribing (40. 63 %).

40|$|Purpose of the Study: This {{experimental}} study examined whether exposure to an injunctive norm against <b>antipsychotic</b> use and <b>a</b> {{sense of being}} evaluated influenced nurses’ intentions to initiate <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> or behavioral intervention with nursing home residents who have dementia-related behavioral difficulties, and examined the interrelationships of perceived time pressures, staffing, self-efficacy, and the nurses’ treatment intentions. Design and Methods: A total of 158 nurses from 28 long-term care facilities were randomized to one of four conditions within a two (injunctive norm: salient vs. not salient) x two (sense of evaluation: salient vs. not salient) between-participants design in this cross-sectional study. The nurses responded to a case study that depicted a resident with dementia-related behavioral difficulties and the dependent variables were their intent to initiate <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> or <b>a</b> behavioral intervention. The nurses completed self-report measures of their self-efficacy, time pressures, perceived staffing, descriptive norms, attitudes, and outcome expectancies. Multi-level modeling was utilized to {{examine the effect of}} the two conditions and explore the correlates of the nurses’ intentions. Results: The provision of a salient injunctive norm and/or a sense of evaluation were not associated with lower intentions to initiate <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> or higher intentions to initiate a behavioral intervention. Individuals working in facilities with higher rates of antipsychotic use had greater intentions to utilize <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> when presented with an injunctive norm than individuals working in facilities with lower rates of antipsychotic use. The nurses’ self-efficacy, attitudes, perceived descriptive norms, and outcome expectancies did not moderate the effect of an injunctive norm on their treatment intentions. Perceived staffing was related to intent to start <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> but not <b>a</b> behavioral intervention, and perceived time pressures were not related to the nurses’ intentions. Implications: Increasing the visibility of <b>a</b> message discouraging <b>antipsychotic</b> use may have limited utility in influencing nurses’ intentions to use <b>an</b> <b>antipsychotic</b> and may even be detrimental in facilities with higher rates of antipsychotic use.
