50|$|The Rejang script, {{sometimes}} spelt Redjang and locally {{known as}} Surat Ulu ('upstream script'), is an abugida of the Brahmic family, and {{is related to}} other scripts of the region, like Batak, Buginese, and others. Rejang {{is a member of}} the closely related group of Surat Ulu scripts that include the script variants of Bengkulu, Lembak, Lintang, Lebong, and Serawai. Other scripts that are closely related, and sometimes included in the Surat Ulu group, are Kerinci and Lampung. The script was in use prior to the introduction of Islam to the Rejang area; the earliest <b>attested</b> <b>document</b> appears to date from the mid-18th century CE. The Rejang script is sometimes also known as the KaGaNga script following the first three letters of the alphabet.
