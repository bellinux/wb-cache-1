25|$|In the United States, {{any public}} animal exhibit must be {{licensed}} and inspected by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the animals they exhibit, {{the activities of}} zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others. Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>welfare,</b> fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed {{by a panel of}} twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of animals falls into three main paradigms; <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>and</b> conservation. This article argues {{that in the}} modern context there are several regulatory challenges which are not accommodated within those parameters including those presented by contemporary issues such as animal diseases and hybrid and feral animals. A case study of honeybees is used to explore these frameworks and their parameters and limitations in detail. The difficulties arising are not confined to idiosyncratic cases such as honeybees however, but also apply at a broader level. While some of these difficulties might be tackled through incremental changes to existing legislation, a more holistic framework which moves beyond historical assumptions {{about the nature of}} animals and their relationship with people therefore, will ultimately be needed...|$|R

40|$|Early {{detection}} of disease by an animal owner may motivate them to seek early veterinary advice. Presentation before {{a more advanced}} clinical manifestation is evident could lead to more effective treatment and thus benefit the <b>animal's</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>welfare.</b> Accelerometers are able to detect changes in specific activities or behaviours, thus indicating early signs of possible adverse health events. The objective of this validation {{study was to determine}} whether the {{detection of}} eight behavioural states: walk, trot, canter/gallop, sleep, static/inactive, eat, drink, and headshake, by an accelerometer device was sufficiently accurate to be useful in a clinical setting. This fully independent external validation estimated the accuracy of a specific triaxial, collar-mounted accelerometer on a second-by second basis in 51 healthy dogs of different breeds, aged between 6 months and 13 years, weighing > 10 kg. The overall diagnostic effectiveness was estimated as: % record correctly classified of > 95 % in walk, trot, canter/gallop, eat, drink and headshake and > 90 % in sleep and static/inactive. The positive predictive values ranged from 93 - 100 %, while the negative predictive values ranged from 96 - 100 %, with exception of static/inactive (86 %). This was probably because dogs were placed in unfamiliar kennels where they did not exhibit their typical resting behaviour. The device is worn on a collar, making its use feasible for anyone wanting to monitor their dog's behaviour. The high accuracy in detecting various kinds of behaviour appears promising in assessing canine <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>welfare</b> states...|$|R
