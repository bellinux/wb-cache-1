25|$|In Nuremberg, Donovan interrogated many prisoners, {{including}} Hermann Göring, whom {{he spoke}} with ten times. But eventually Donovan fell out with Jackson. The latter wanted to indict the entire German High Command, not just men who had personally ordered or committed war crimes; Donovan considered this a violation of American principles of fairness. Donovan, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> also criticized Jackson's lack of skill and experience at putting together a strong case and at courtroom examination and cross-examination.

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{corruption}} of minors statute against adults corrupting the morals of minors under 18 years of age. However, the corruption of minors statute only applies to perpetrators 18 {{years of age and}} older, so it is always legal for minors 16-17 to have sex with each other but not always with a partner 18 or older. Pennsylvania prosecutors use this law against adults who have consensual intercourse with 16- and 17-year-olds, and it would count as a misdemeanor offense. In 2005 JoAnne Epps, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>prosecutor</b> and Temple University Beasley School of Law dean of academic affairs, stated that the corruption of minors charge {{is considered to be a}} separate crime from that of statutory rape; she stated that the consideration of whether a minor is consenting to sexual activity is a separate issue from whether someone is corrupting the minor's morals.|$|E

2500|$|Former UN Under Secretary General for Oversight Services Inga-Britt Ahlenius denounced Ban Ki-moon after resigning her post in 2010, {{calling him}} [...] "reprehensible". Ahlenius {{claimed that the}} Secretary-General made efforts to {{undermine}} the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) mandate and challenge its operational independence. In particular, the two disputed Ahlenius's plans to hire <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> Robert Appleton, who had carried out investigations into corruption in UN peacekeeping missions from 2006 to 2009. Ban's staff explained that Appleton's appointment was rejected because Ahlenius had not properly considered female candidates for the appointment, {{and said that the}} final selection should have been made by Ban, not Ahlenius. Ahlenius claimed in her End of Assignment memo that [...] "for the Secretary-General to control appointments in OIOS is an infringement of the operational independence of OIOS". Ban's chief of staff Vijay Nambiar described Ahlenius's complaints as [...] "a deeply unbalanced account", and also stated that [...] "many pertinent facts were overlooked or misrepresented" [...] in Ahlenius's memo. Nambiar further noted that Ban [...] "fully recognizes the operational independence of OIOS, [...] does not excuse [...] from applying the standard rules of recruitment".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 2001, {{the primary}} {{responsibility}} for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith {{in charge of all}} investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently. According to John L. Allen, Jr., Ratzinger in the following years [...] "acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim" [...] and [...] "driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess". In his role as Head of the CDF, he [...] "led important changes made in Church law: the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children, the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, the case by case waiving of the statute of limitation and the establishment of a fast-track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders." [...] As the Head of the CDF, Ratzinger developed a reputation for handling these cases. According to Charles J. Scicluna, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>prosecutor</b> handling sexual abuse cases, [...] "Cardinal Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling those cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, sine acceptione personarum (without exceptions)".|$|E
