25|$|The 5th Olympic Festival {{was again}} held at Llandudno on 25–26 June 1866. John Hulley {{followed}} this event by organising a swimming fete for juveniles {{at the same}} venue on 27 July 1866. During his stay at Llandudno he revisited his views concerning the modes of bathing attire for males and females. He addressed a large gathering on the Parade and spoke {{about the need for}} British holiday resorts to follow the lead of those on the continent in the matter of dress. His main theme was simply that there were two things to be done before British bathing will be as decent, as moral, as enjoyable, as bathing on the continent. The first was to get men and women to wear decent bathing dresses; and the second was, to induce them to be in company. At the close of his address, discussion was invited, but, with the exception of two gentlemen who spoke in favour of Mr Hulley's views, no discussion was entered upon. The question was then put to the meeting whether the views advocated were such as met the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> present, and was carried unanimously. His speech was reported in the Pall Mall Gazette of 7 September 1866.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not know the facts. The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian government is going to demand... and I think we may say with some assurance that they had expressed <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is clear}} now to {{everybody}} who has any opinion on this {{most important of}} all subjects, that spontaneousness is the first quality in connection with right doing, which you can develop in the young, and this spontaneousness of habit is best secured by associating it with the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> to whom the child looks. Sympathy, in a word, is the true foundation from which to build up the structure of good habit. The young should be led to practise the elementary parts of right conduct from the desire to please, because that is a securer basis than the conclusions of an embryo reason, applied to the most complex conditions of action, while the grounds on which action is justified or condemned may be made plain in the fulness of time, when the understanding is better able to deal with the ideas and terms essential to the matter. You have two aims to secure, each without sacrifice of the other. These are, first, that the child shall grow up with firm and promptly acting habit; second, that it shall retain respect for reason and an open mind. The latter may be acquired in the less immature years, but if the former be not acquired in the earlier times, a man grows up with a drifting unsettledness of will, that makes his life either vicious by quibbling sophistries, or helpless for want of ready conclusions.|$|E

50|$|January 31, 2000: Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, {{plunged into}} the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu, California while {{preparing}} to attempt an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle, killing all 88 people on board. In its final report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined {{the cause of the}} accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the horizontal stabilizer's trim system. The failure of the acme nut threads happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident. This incident, along with an earlier ValuJet Flight 592 crash, led to closer FAA oversight of airline maintenance operations.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between plans and their implementation through development projects. Specifically, it asks: Do local plans that specify priority sites for development lead to the <b>approvals</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> projects? To answer this question, I look at the recent planning initiatives and their associated priority development projects in two cities - Santa Monica's Land Use and Transportation Element (LUCE) and Bergamot Transit Village project, and Newton's Comprehensive Plan and Austin Street project. Specifically, I look at the permitting process of each project {{to determine if the}} plans had any role in facilitating project approvals. I conclude that while plans {{play an important role in}} defining community priorities, they have a limited ability to facilitate project approvals. Instead, I find that each city's specific legal framework around land use decisions, including state laws on voter referendum and local policy on special permits, play a much more definitive role. In light of underlying legal and political undertones around development, I offer two suggestions to cities aiming to improve plan implementation. First, facilitate direct ideation from community members through the appointment of citizen task-forces that promote citizen leadership and co-learning around community concerns, while maintaining traditional public hearings as a platform for structured support and dissent. Second, build up and maintain confidence in this enhanced task-force process by insulating carefully-vetted outcomes from outright repeal. Together, these recommendations encourage a more politically-strategic and engaged approach to planning, suggesting that plan implementation will occur best when legal mechanisms and community political will align with the vision set forth in a city's best laid plans. by Esther Chung.
