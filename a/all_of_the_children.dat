Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of his sister Rangorimanana.

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff was {{the second}} of three {{children}} born to Vera and Walter Meckiff; he had an older brother Don and a younger sister Margaret. Growing up in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mentone, the children went to Mentone Primary School before progressing to Mordialloc-Chelsea High School, where both brothers became prefects. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> represented their high school for sport—Don and Ian in athletics, swimming, football and cricket; and Margaret in softball. The brothers played for Mentone Cricket Club in the Federal District Cricket Association, Ian as a left-arm unorthodox spinner. He routinely dominated the opposition batsmen in the competition, taking 200 wickets at a bowling average of only 4.50 during his career with Mentone. He began playing in Mentone's under-16 team {{at the age of}} 11.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{attended}} the nearby George Street State School {{and one by}} one the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access to all of the club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E

Quentin—along with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in her family—received home-schooling rather than attending the local State school.

25|$|In the Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior (1963), {{a variant}} of the induced-compliance paradigm, by Elliot Aronson and Carlsmith, {{examined}} self-justification in children. In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told {{the second half of the}} group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).|$|E

25|$|After Archange's and Antoine's deaths, {{seven of}} their {{children}} petitioned {{the federal government for}} permission to sell the land, as the treaty had stipulated that no part of land could be sold without permission from the President of the United States. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> except for one, were living in Council Bluffs with no intention of moving back. They reasoned that they were living too far away to protect the land from illegal timber poaching. President James K. Polk approved the sale of the land, and in 1845 the entire reservation was collectively sold by the Ouilmette children, save for one sliver that Joseph Ouilmette sold individually at a later date.|$|E
25|$|The show {{focuses on}} the life of the Duggar family, who are devout Baptists, and {{frequently}} discusses values of purity, modesty, and faith in God. The Duggars avoid birth control saying they have decided to allow God to determine the number of children they have. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> are homeschooled, and access to entertainment such as movies and television is limited. They practice chaperoned courtship, in which a couple acquaints itself only in a group setting. The values presented on the show have been associated with the Quiverfull movement, which has been described as promoting strict family conformity, male hierarchies, and subservient roles for women. The Duggars have stated they are not associated with the Quiverfull movement.|$|E
25|$|Altering the murderer's motives. In the novel, Lady Westholme murdered Mrs Boynton to {{keep her}} past secret. Before {{climbing}} the social ladder, she was incarcerated in the same prison where Mrs Boynton had been a warden. Knowing Mrs Boynton's sadistic personality, she silenced her {{to keep her}} reputation and her social status. In the adaptation, Dame Celia Westholme served as a maid {{in the home of}} Lady Boynton (who was then Mrs Pierce) before becoming a writer. She had an affair with Dr Gerard, delivered a child, and was sent away to a nunnery in Ireland while Lady Boynton kept the baby. That child turned out to be Jinny.

25|$|In the German-speaking lands, {{groups of}} young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door. They are dressed as the three Wise Men, plus the leader {{carrying}} a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle. Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls {{for the benefit of}} singing their songs in four-part harmony, not necessarily three wise men at all. German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three. The star singers will be offered treats at the homes they visit, but they also solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Evangelical-Lutheran churches. As a sign of gratitude, the young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk. In Roman Catholic communities this may be a serious spiritual event with the priest present even today, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit. Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches. Here <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> who have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars. The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan {{was devoted}} to his parents, {{particularly}} his mother, with whom he corresponded regularly, when away from London, until her death in 1882.

Sullivan was also very fond of his brother Fred, whose acting career he assisted whenever possible, and of Fred's children. When Fred {{died at the age of}} 39, he left his pregnant wife, Charlotte, with seven children under the age of 14.
