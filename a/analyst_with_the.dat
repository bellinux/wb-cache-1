The Admiral Kuznetsovs hull design {{is based on the}} Admiral Gorshkov but is larger with a full load displacement, 58,500 tons as compared to Admiral Gorshkovs 40,400 tons. KH-11 satellite photographs of the construction of the Admiral Kuznetsov were leaked to Jane's Defense Weekly in 1985 by Samuel Loring Morison, a naval intelligence <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy.|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} {{was put into}} doubt after the August 2008 war in South Ossetia and Russia's subsequent recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. Stephen Smith, the Australian Foreign Minister, told Sky News Australia in November 2008 that ratification of the agreement would see Australia reviewing Russia's involvement in Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and also by {{taking into account the}} state of bilateral relations between the two countries. After Russia recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 26 August 2008, Stephen Smith summoned the Russian ambassador, Alexander Blokhin, to inform him that Russia's recognition was not helpful for the situation in the region, while Blokhin informed the Australian Foreign Minister that Russia was left with no choice but to recognise the independence of the two regions. Blaming Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili for the conflict, Blokhin told The Age that the Russians were not the aggressors, but rather the peacekeepers. Rory Medcalf, a strategic <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Lowy Institute, stated that Australia could use the uranium deal to apply pressure on Moscow, but in doing so it risked sending messages to countries such as China that it is an unreliable supplier, which would in turn hurt Australian interests.|$|E
500|$|In Beni Suef, {{south of}} Cairo, 17 protesters {{were killed by}} police as the protesters {{attempted}} to attack two police stations. In Abu Zabaal prison in Cairo, eight people were killed as police clashed with inmates trying to escape. According to a Reuters tally, these unconfirmed deaths brought the death toll to at least 100. Several Islamist terrorists and others escaped. Prison overcrowding and police brutality were voiced {{by many of the}} protesters. Emad Gad, an <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said that he had obtained information from a trustworthy source that [...] "there have been orders from the very top to free known felons from the prisons, to arm them and to let them mingle with protesters."

2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there was a}} {{consensus}} within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they {{will never be able}} to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power. Thomas Petersnik, an <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: [...] "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".|$|E

[...] Golos said it had received more than 3,000 reports of election abuse on a special hotline. It said various violations during the voting amounted to [...] "an organised campaign". Golos made public {{an analysis of the}} 1,329 complaints that were filed during the elections and of the observations of its 2,500 election monitors. According to the report, 23% of all complaints involved officials and police hindering the work of election monitors, 22% involved reports of illegal campaigning, 15% percent involved purported manipulations of the voter lists, 11% percent involved pressure on voters and 9% involved alleged violations of regulations protecting voter privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, an <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because {{he did not believe}} it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{exhibits}} of {{food are}} especially remarkable. We cleaned the glass case with our sleeves and {{peered at the}} most appetising revelations. There are dozens of little bottles hermetically sealed, containing such curios as a sample of [...] "Bacon Common (Gammon) Uncooked," [...] and then the same cooked--it looked no nicer cooked--Irish sausage, pork sausage, black pudding, Welsh mutton, {{and all kinds of}} rare and exquisite feeding. There are ever so many cases of this kind of thing. We saw, for instance, further along, several good specimens of the common oyster shell (Ostrea edulis), cockle shells, and whelks, both [...] "almonds" [...] and [...] "whites," [...] and then came breadstuffs. The breadstuffs are particularly impressive, of a grey, scientific aspect, a hard, hoary antiquity. We always knew that stale bread was good for one, but yet the Parkes Museum startled us with the antique pattern it recommended. There was a muffin, too, identified and labelled, but without any Latin name, a captured crumpet, a collection of buns, a dinner-roll, and a something novel to us, called Pumpernickel, that we had rather be without, or rather--for the expression is ambiguous--that we had rather not be without, but altogether remote from. And all these things have been tested by an <b>analyst,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most painful results. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and the like nasty chemical things seem indeed to have occurred in everything he touched. Those sturdy mendicants who go about complaining that they cannot get food should visit this Parkes Museum and see what food is really like, and learn contentment with their lot.|$|E
