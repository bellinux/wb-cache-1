40|$|A {{preceding}} paper {{demonstrated that}} explicit <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods</b> generally work {{much better for}} extremely stiff reaction networks than has previously been shown in the literature. There we showed that for systems well removed from equilibrium explicit <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods</b> can rival standard implicit codes in speed and accuracy for solving extremely stiff differential equations. In this paper we continue the investigation of systems well removed from equilibrium by examining quasi-steady-state (QSS) methods {{as an alternative to}} <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods.</b> We show that for systems well removed from equilibrium, QSS methods also can compete with, or even exceed, standard implicit methods in speed, even for extremely stiff networks, and in many cases give somewhat better integration speed than for <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods.</b> As for <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods,</b> we will find that QSS methods give correct results, but with non-competitive integration speed as equilibrium is approached. Thus, we shall find that both <b>asymptotic</b> and QSS <b>methods</b> must be supplemented with partial equilibrium methods as equilibrium is approached to remain competitive with implicit methods.

Since 1932, he worked together with his student Nikolay Bogoliubov on mathematical problems of non-linear mechanics. In this period, they invented certain asymptotic methods for integration of non-linear differential equations, studied dynamical systems, and made significant contributions to the foundations of non-linear mechanics. They proved the first theorems on existence of invariant measures known as Krylov-Bogolyubov theorems, introduced the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and, together with Yurii Mitropolskiy, developed the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolskiy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> for approximate solving equations of non-linear mechanics.|$|E

50|$|Massey {{has made}} many {{original}} contributions as a mathematician {{by developing a}} theory of “dynamical queueing systems”. Classical queueing models assumed that calling rates were constant so they could use the static, equilibrium analysis of time homogeneous Markov chains. However, real communication systems call for the large scale analysis of queueing models with time-varying rates. His thesis at Stanford University created a dynamic, <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> for time inhomogeneous Markov chains called “uniform acceleration” {{to deal with such}} problems. Moreover, his research on queueing networks led to new methods of comparing multi-dimensional, Markov processes by viewing them as “stochastic orderings” on “partially ordered spaces”. Finally, one of his most cited papers develops an algorithm to find a dynamic, optimal server staffing schedule for telephone call centers with time varying demand, which led to a patent. Another highly cited paper creates a temporally and spatially dynamic model for the offered load traffic of wireless communication networks.|$|E

40|$|This book {{emphasizes}} {{in detail}} {{the applicability of the}} Optimal Homotopy <b>Asymptotic</b> <b>Method</b> to various engineering problems. It is a continuation of the book “Nonlinear Dynamical Systems in Engineering: Some Approximate Approaches”, published at Springer in 2011, and it contains a great amount of practical models from various fields of engineering such as classical and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, nonlinear oscillations, electrical machines, and so on. The main structure of the book consists of 5 chapters. The first chapter is introductory while the second chapter is devoted to a short history of the development of homotopy methods, including the basic ideas of the Optimal Homotopy <b>Asymptotic</b> <b>Method.</b> The last three chapters, from Chapter 3 to Chapter 5, are introducing three distinct alternatives of the Optimal Homotopy <b>Asymptotic</b> <b>Method</b> with illustrative applications to nonlinear dynamical systems. The third chapter deals with the first alternative of our approach with two iterations. Five applications are presented from fluid mechanics and nonlinear oscillations.   The Chapter 4 presents the Optimal Homotopy <b>Asymptotic</b> <b>Method</b> with a single iteration and solving the linear equation on the first approximation. Here are treated 32 models from different fields of engineering such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, nonlinear damped and undamped oscillations, electrical machines and even from physics and biology.

30|$|The second {{category}} of deterministic approaches encompasses the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods.</b> Contrary to full-wave <b>methods,</b> <b>asymptotic</b> ones do not rigorously solve the EM problem resulting in time performance improvements and problem up-sizing. <b>Asymptotic</b> <b>methods</b> are particularly {{adapted to the}} channel modelling problematic. Two classes of <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods</b> exist. The first one {{is based on an}} optical-ray assumption and includes Geometrical Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction. Considering infinite sized elements, the EM field propagates along ray path satisfying Fermat's principle. The EM problem is then solved using geometric formulations such as Snell-Descartes laws. Two ray-optical algorithms are competing in the literature: the Shooting and Bouncing Rays and the Ray Tracing algorithms both presented in [12]. A second class of <b>asymptotic</b> <b>methods</b> is based on the equivalent current method and regroups Physical Theory of Diffraction and PO. Contrary to exact methods, instead of solving rigorously the EM problem, only first harmonic terms of currents are here considered using an integral formulation of Maxwell's equations. With PO-based algorithms, the main limitation is that the current assumption enounced above is valid only for objects larger than a few (e.g. three) wavelengths [2].|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we use the}} {{standard}} optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> for the analytical solution of higher order ordinary differential equations with two or multi point boundary conditions, a nonlinear family of partial differential equations with an initial condition and Integro differential equations. The results obtained are compared with the results obtained by the application of Adomain decomposition method, homotopy perturbation method, variational iteration method, differential transform method and homotopy analysis method etc. The optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> uses a flexible auxiliary function, which controls the convergence of the solution and allows adjustment in the convergence region where it is needed. Moreover, the procedure of this method is simple, clearly well-defined and the built-in recursive relations are explicitly worked out for easy use. Numerical results obtained by the optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> reveal high accuracy and excellent agreement with the exact solutions. Apart from the application of optimal homotopy asymtotic method, we develop a new scheme by using Daftardar-Jafari polynomials in the homotopy of optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method</b> to solve nonlinear problems more effectively. This scheme is almost as simple as the optimal homotopy asymtotic method but its results are more accurate than the usual optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method.</b> To show {{the effectiveness of this}} scheme, we solve different bench mark problems from literature and compare the results with those obtained by {{the standard}} optimal homotopy <b>asymptotic</b> <b>method.</b> To determine the convergence control parameters of the auxiliary function, two well known methods are followed The Least squares and the Galerkin methods. We also explore and use a variety of the forms of auxiliary functions that results more accuracy and shows flexibility and reliability of the methods. For symbolic computation, we use Mathematica 7.
