5|$|The civitas (tribal community) of the Helvetii {{was similar}} to that of the Celtic tribes of the Valais, which were merged into a single civitas Vallensis {{probably}} around 40AD, and given Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny) as their capital. Parts of the modern Ticino belonged to the colony of Comum (Como), founded in the 1st century <b>AD.</b> <b>On</b> the local level, the basic administrative units were the vici, replacing the Helvetic pagi, or tribes, which were dissolved at the time of colonization. These villages enjoyed a certain autonomy and were governed by popularly elected magistrates (magistri or curatores).|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} of an occupation on the tell exists following {{the destruction of the}} Mitannian city, however, a series of small villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of the first millennium AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century <b>AD),</b> <b>on</b> the basis of its architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town with water from the nearby Jaghjagh River.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the {{construction of}} the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 <b>AD).</b> <b>On</b> this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>ad</b> spots <b>on</b> SERPs, the major advertising networks allow for contextual ads {{to be placed}} on the properties of 3rd-parties with whom they have partnered. These publishers sign up to host <b>ads</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the network. In return, they receive a portion of the ad revenue that the network generates, which can be anywhere from 50% to over 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers. These properties are often referred to as a content network and the <b>ads</b> <b>on</b> them as contextual ads because the ad spots are associated with keywords based on the context of the page on which they are found. In general, <b>ads</b> <b>on</b> content networks have a much lower click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CR) than <b>ads</b> found <b>on</b> SERPs and consequently are less highly valued. Content network properties can include websites, newsletters, and e-mails.|$|R
