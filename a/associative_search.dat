40|$|When {{searching for}} {{concepts}} in memory-as in the verbal fluency task of naming {{all the animals}} one can think of-people appear to explore internal mental representations {{in much the same}} way that animals forage in physical space: searching locally within patches of information before transitioning globally between patches. However, the definition of the patches being searched in mental space is not well specified. Do we search by activating explicit predefined categories (e. g., pets) and recall items from within that category (categorical search), or do we activate and recall a connected sequence of individual items without using categorical information, with each item recalled leading to the retrieval of an associated item in a stream (<b>associative</b> <b>search),</b> or both? Using semantic representations in a search of associative memory framework and data from the animal fluency task, we tested competing hypotheses based on associative and categorical search models. Associative, but not categorical, patch transitions took longer to make than position-matched productions, suggesting that categorical transitions were not true transitions. There was also clear evidence of <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> even within categorical patch boundaries. Furthermore, most individuals' behavior was best explained by an <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> model without the addition of categorical information. Thus, our results support a search process that does not use categorical information, but for which patch boundaries shift with each recall and local search is well described by a random walk in semantic space, with switches to new regions of the semantic space when the current region is depleted. ...|$|E

40|$|Buffering more {{in-flight}} {{instructions in}} an out-of-order microprocessor is a straightforward and effective method to help tolerate the long latencies generally associated with off-chip memory accesses. One {{of the main}} challenges of buffering {{a large number of}} instructions, however, is the implementation of a scalable and efficient mechanism to detect memory access order violations as a result of out-oforder scheduling of load and store instructions. Traditional CAM-based associative queues can be very slow and energy consuming. In this paper, instead of using the traditional age-based load queue to record load addresses, we explicitly record age information in address-indexed hash tables to achieve the same functionality of detecting premature loads. This alternative design eliminates <b>associative</b> <b>searches</b> and significantly reduces the energy consumption of the load queue. With simple techniques {{to reduce the number of}} false positives, performance degradation is kept at a minimum...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an access method called branch index for query {{processing}} of the aggregation hierarchy as {{a tree in}} object-oriented databases. The algorithm of branch generation will be proposed to generate all branches for the tree aggregation of classes in the database. For each branch, the information of linking objects is stored so that class traversal methods can be eliminated. Using a set of attribute indexes and identity indexes for each branch, <b>associative</b> <b>searching</b> can be conveniently performed. We discuss the retrieval and update operation and then develop cost models in terms of storage overhead, retrieval cost and update cost. When compared with the path dictionary index for multiple paths, the result shows that our approach has less storage overhead and the retrieval cost is improving. Key words: access method, object-oriented database, aggregation hierarchy, query processing. 1...|$|R

For example, DNA computing has the potential to provide huge memories: DNA in weak solution in one liter of water can encode 10 19 bytes, and one can perform massively parallel <b>associative</b> <b>searches</b> on these memories, [6], [42].

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a formal specification in Z {{of a new}} intelligent hypertext model called the soft-link hypertext model (SLHM).

The functionality of resulting systems using this approach is then extended from Boolean search to more sophisticated information retrieval applications, including <b>associative</b> <b>searches</b> and information browsing. Compared with other similar projects, SLHM has the following three major advantages. First, the conceptual index is automatically formulated.

40|$|The {{instruction}} scheduling logic used in modern superscalar microprocessors often relies on <b>associative</b> <b>searching</b> {{of the issue}} queue entries to dynamically wakeup instructions for the execution. Traditional designs use one issue queue entry for each instruction, regardless of {{the actual number of}} operands actively used in the wakeup process. In this paper we propose Instruction Packing – a novel microarchitectural technique that reduces both the delay and the power consumption of the issue queue by sharing the associative part of an issue queue entry between two instructions, each with at most one non-ready register source operand at the time of dispatch. Our results show that Instruction Packing provides a 39 % reduction of the whole issue queue power and 21. 6 % reduction in the wakeup delay with as little as 0. 4 % IPC degradation on the average across the simulated SPEC benchmarks...|$|R

The architecture is a highly-parallel network of small processors of two types connected in a full binary tree network.

File updates cause a reorganization of the tree, which is accomplished in a manner that can accommodate either incremental or massive changes.
