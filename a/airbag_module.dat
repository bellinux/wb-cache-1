50|$|During a crash event, the vehicle's crash sensor(s) provide crucial {{information}} to the airbag electronic controller unit (ECU), including collision type, angle and severity of impact. Using this information, the airbag electronic controller unit's crash algorithm determines if the crash event meets the criteria for deployment and triggers various firing circuits to deploy one or more airbag modules within the vehicle. Working as a supplemental restraint system to the vehicle's seat-belt systems, <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> deployments are triggered through a pyrotechnic process {{that is designed to}} be used once. Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed air cylinders that are triggered {{in the event of a}} side on vehicle impact.|$|E
50|$|An airbag {{is a type}} {{of vehicle}} safety device and is an {{occupant}} restraint system. The <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact with a surface or a rapid sudden deceleration.It consists of the airbag cushion, a flexible fabric bag, inflation module and impact sensor. The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a soft cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent any impact or impact-caused injuries between the flailing occupant and the interior of the vehicle.The airbag provides an energy absorbing surface between the vehicle's occupant and a steering wheel, instrumental panel, A-B-C- structural body frame pillars, headliner and windshield/windscreen.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{advances}} {{were made in}} the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car, with ABS becoming an optional feature in 1990. Following the return of 4-wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in 1991 (for the first time since 1979), ABS became standard in 1992. As {{with the rest of the}} Panther-platform vehicles, the Town Car was fitted with a driver's side airbag in 1990, although the Town Car was technically designed to be fitted with dual airbags (the first American-produced luxury vehicle to be fitted with them). However, due to supply problems with the passenger <b>airbag</b> <b>module,</b> the passenger airbag essentially became a delete option, with a credit on the window sticker issued for the price of the missing airbag. Upon owner request, for the price of the issued credit, the passenger airbag would be installed. By the beginning of the 1992 model year, all Town Cars come equipped with dual airbags from the factory.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{deployment}} of an airbag is most fatal and dangerous to a passenger {{when it is}} in an out of position (OOP) situation, with the airbag making contact before it is fully inflated. This can lead to severe, if not life threatening, injuries to the passenger. This situation is more commonly associated with small females and children who are positioned near to the <b>airbag</b> <b>module,</b> i. e. in an OOP load case. The aim {{of this research is}} to assess the response of a Hybrid III 5 th percentile female anthropomorphic dummy positioned in an FMVSS 208 low risk static airbag deployment OOP load cases using a transient dynamic finite element program called LS-DYNA. The simulation considers the standard procedures utilised in the LS-DYNA, where assumptions such as uniform airbag pressure and temperature are made, along with a more recently developed procedure that takes into account the fluid-structure interaction between the inflating gas source and the airbag fabric, referred to as arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) theory. Both simulations were compared to test data received by Jaguar, indicating satisfactory results in terms of correlation, with the more recently developed procedure, ALE theory, showing the greatest accuracy, both in terms of graphical and schematic comparison, especially in the very early stages of the inflation process. As a result, the new simulation procedure model was utilised to research into the effects of changing the designs of the <b>airbag</b> <b>module...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} investigations {{suggest that}} a deploying airbag may fracture the forearm. These studies positioned the arm in an overhand grasp placing the forearm over the <b>airbag</b> <b>module.</b> However, there is little published data on how drivers grip {{the steering wheel and}} the general proximity of the upper extremity to the <b>airbag</b> <b>module.</b> The objective of the current study was to identify 'real world' upper extremity positions and to correlate these with accident and experimental data. A survey of the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) for the years 1995 - 1999 reveled {{an increase in the number}} of forearm fractures due to driver-airbag interaction. As NASS does not provide information about the position of the forearm, common upper extremity positions were identified in a volunteer driving population. These positions were simulated using a specially instrumented 50 th percentile male dummy to determine the relative injury risk for the different positions. Analysis showed that an under hand grasp of the wheel turned 90 degrees yielded the highest magnitude impact event. The single position was then simulated in nine cadaver experiments. Dual stage airbag deployments produced forearm fractures in two arms. Experiments using the contralateral arms from the fractured subjects with a single stage airbag deployment produced no fractures. Analysis of forearm kinematics suggests that increasing forearm velocity and thus, acceleration exposure, is associated with forearm injury. Further, the data suggests that reductions in acceleration exposure via reduced airbag inflation decreased the apparent risk of forearm fracture...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years the}} {{numerical}} method of the simulation for the airbag deployment {{process has been}} improved with new material model and thermodynamic model, {{and has become a}} standard application of finite element codes. With such simulation tools, it is possible to attempt supporting the <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> design and evaluating the injuries of dummy in airbag hazard area or out-of-position. Although the simulation model for the airbag’s deployment process is usually correlated with the static airbag deployments and reaction force results, up-to-date the numerical approach to represent the fluid flow within the airbag is both costly and time consuming. This paper will provide an overview of the correlation process for reducing the resource to be invested. The following two tests are conducted for acquiring the reference data. 1. Static deployment test for acquiring the airbag internal pressure during the deployment process and 2. Drop tower test for acquiring the fully deployed airbag’s reaction force. The drop tower test is simulated to determine the parameter related to the leakage of fabric and vent holes with the airbag model using the uniform pressure method offering the relatively short solving time. And then Static deployment test is simulated for determining the parameter related to the unfolding phase with the airbag model using the corpuscular (particle) method. These two simulations are compared to the test results and satisfactory correlation is found in both the cases. The drop tower simulation using the uniform pressure method leads to reduce the total correlation time and to easily extend the application for protection of the driver occupant while in-position. This airbag model can be used in parametric studies to investigate the effects of <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> design changes and to study the out-of-position (OOP) load case...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the FMVSS 208 Final Rule, the requirements for occupant protection systems in frontal crashes have significantly increased. Especially the requirements regarding the airbag aggressiveness for “Low Risk Deployment ” pose new challenges for both automobile manufacturers and suppliers. The testing procedure detailed in § S 26 of the FMVSS 208 is commonly referred to as “Out-of-Position ” (OoP). This procedure considers the HIII 5 % dummy on the driver side for two different positions (position 1 : “Chin on Module”, position 2 : “Chin on Rim”). With the applied testing method, the test setup allows tolerances regarding the dummy positioning relative to the vehicle environment. A comprehensive analysis of the influence of the dummy positioning has shown that particularly the head angle can vary among dummy manufacturers and may result in different OoP load characteristics. Beside In addition to tolerances caused by the <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> and the steering wheel design itself, the dummy’s head angle is a significant factor for a variation of the OoP test results. Out-of-position tests with identical module design have shown that the dummy positioning resulting from the head angle can lead to a misinterpretation of the test results. Depending on the dummy position, the OoP results range from far below the legal limits to a value exceeding them. During the module development process, this scope of interpretations dramatically affects the assessment of the OoP performance and may lead to wrong conclusions...|$|E

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the environmental performance of a driver airbag, produced by Autoliv Sverige AB, by using cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The studied airbag is a pyrotechnical airbag, thus representing 80 % of types of airbag produced by Autoliv. Pyrotechnical airbags operate solely by the deployment of chemical mixtures, as opposed to hybrid airbags which also used compressed nitrogen. The study includes data collection by surveying the companies throughout the supply chain and conducting literature review for general data to supplement the site-specific data; calculating the environmental parameters; analyzing the results by locating dominant substances and processes; and comparing the environmental load of the airbag package with a complete car. The results of this LCA study shows that life cycle of one unit driver airbag may cause global warming equivalent to 31. 78 kg of CO 2, acidification equivalent to 50. 42 g of SO 2, eutrophication equivalent to 39. 35 g of NOx, resource depletion of 1. 52 E- 10 g/reservebase, toxicological impact to aquatic equivalents to 947. 73 m 3 of water, and 67. 78 g of contaminated bodyweight for human toxicity. The entire life cycle for one airbag also generates 4. 93 kg waste and consumes 569. 56 MJ energy and 79. 24 kg water. Dominant processes in the whole life cycle are steel production due to its high water and energy consumption, polyamide production due to its high energy consumption and various emissions, and the use phase due to its high fuel consumption. Some materials in the airbag system should be avoided for environmental consideration, mainly by reducing the weight of steel components and polyamide content in <b>airbag</b> <b>module.</b> In particular, zinc coating, used in steel production, is associated with a relatively large environmental loads. Further research should be directed to more finely detect areas of improvement with regard to weight reduction and raw material selection...|$|E
40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B – volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN load limiter belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN load limiter belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a driver side <b>airbag</b> <b>module.</b> Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction force of the bag on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driver’s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed diagonal belts that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 ̶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteer’s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. Belt loads and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteers’ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to improve {{transportation}} safety for occupants of motor vehicles seated in wheelchairs (i. e., to improve wheelchair transportation safety, or WTS), {{with an emphasis on}} drivers seated in wheelchairs. Investigation of crash and non-crash events involving one or more occupants in wheelchairs indicates that a primary reason occupants in wheelchairs sustain serious-to-fatal injuries is improper or incomplete use of lap/shoulder-belt restraints due, in large part, to interference by wheelchair arm supports with proper belt positioning. Efforts to improve frontal crash protection for drivers in wheelchairs resulted in a prototype seat-belt deployment system (SBDS) that provides components needed to complete the vehicle lap/shoulder belt for use in a passive mode while eliminating obstacles that interfere with maneuvering a wheelchair into the driver space. Sled-test evaluations and design improvements of a commercially available vehicle-anchored headand-back restraint for rear-impact protection of drivers in wheelchairs led to several design and material changes that improved performance and that the manufacturer can use to improve the commercial system. Results of sled tests and computer simulations of drivers in wheelchairs with and without steering-wheel air-bag deployments during a 48 -kph frontal crash indicate that there is little basis for concern that advanced steering-wheel air bags will cause serious injuries in frontal crashes. Rather, steering-wheel air bags almost always reduce the risk of head, neck, and chest injuries. Deactivating steering-wheel air bags should only be considered when the driver in a wheelchair is positioned with his/her chest or chin 200 cm or less from the air-bag module during normal operation of the vehicle. Using a fixed upper shoulder-belt anchor point instead of the OEM seat-belt retractor will reduce driver movement toward the <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> during pre-impact braking and may enhance safety for many drivers in wheelchairs by providing greater torso stability in their optimal posture. Safety Tip Sheets and a DriveSafe brochure have been developed to provide vehicle modifiers and other key stakeholder with information on how to provide safer transportation for occupants seated in wheelchairs. These are being made available on a new UMTRI website that provides a wide range of educational materials on WTS, including lists of wheelchairs, wheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint systems (WTORS), and wheelchair seating systems that comply with WTS industry standards. Additional work is needed to implement the SBDS into a commercial product and to continue efforts to educate key stakeholder groups with regard to best practice in WTS and their role in improving transportation safety for passengers and drivers seated in wheelchairs...|$|E

40|$|This {{report will}} discuss the use of {{advanced}} simulation techniques to optimize {{the performance of the}} proposed Orion Crew <b>Module</b> <b>airbag</b> landing system design. The Boeing Company and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration s Langley Research Center collaborated in the analysis of the proposed airbag landing system for the next generation space shuttle replacement, the Orion spacecraft. Using LS-DYNA to simulate the Crew Module landing impacts, two main objectives were established and achieved: the investigation of potential methods of optimizing the airbag performance in order to reduce rebound on the anti-bottoming bags, lower overall landing loads, and increase overall Crew Module stability; and the determination of the Crew Module stability and load boundaries using the optimized airbag design, based on the potential Crew Module landing pitch angles and ground slopes in both the center of gravity forward and aft configurations.

30|$|Extensive {{studies have}} shown that the airbag {{deployment}} in load cases consists of two occupant loading phases: a punch-out effect where the airbag bursts out of its container with the airbag and <b>airbag</b> <b>module</b> cover accelerating towards the occupant and a second loading phase during which the airbag is taking on its deployed shape and volume (membrane-loading effect). Bankdak et al. (2002) developed an experimental airbag test system to study airbag-occupant interactions during close proximity deployment. The results provided insight for simulating the effect of inflation energy and mass flow on target response. Bedard et al. (2002) found that while left-side (driver-side) impacts accounted for only 13.5 % of all crashes, the fatality rate among these crashes was 68.3 % in comparison to front impact (48.3 %), right-side impact (31.3 %), and rear impact (38.4 %). These studies underscore the importance of occupant safety during side-impact collisions. In the last years, the current market requested to reduce the time and cost airbag development. In order to achieve this result, virtual simulations play an important role since they allow to minimize the number of experimental tests (Pei et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2014). Several simulation models of airbag were established (Wang et al. 2007). It is feasible to optimize the parameters of airbag deployment using simulation technology. Experimental and numerical studies have quantified injury risks to close-proximity occupants from deploying side airbags. These studies have focused on the prevention of the most adverse effects of airbag deployment (Duma et al. 2003). Other studies have proposed airbag characteristics to minimize particular biomechanical responses (Haland and Pipkorn 1996). In a more recent study, Marklund and Nilsson (2003) compared deformation patterns with experimental data as well as the computational costs associated with three different airbag deployment simulation methods; they concluded that the SPH method is relatively inexpensive and produces incremental deformation patterns that compare most closely to the experimental results. The process of inflation of an airbag is one of the determining factors in saving lives. The duration from the initial impact of the crash to the full inflation of an airbag is about 40  ms, and during this time, the airbag goes from being in a folded state to a fully inflated state, with a high internal pressure. After achieving this state, the airbag begins to deflate, thus providing a nice cushion for the body impacting it. Ideally, the person in the crash should come into contact with the airbag at this time. In the present study, a large volume passenger side airbag model is developed to handle different collision scenarios. The main aim is evaluate the performance of deploying of passenger side airbag using finite element methods (FEM).|$|E
