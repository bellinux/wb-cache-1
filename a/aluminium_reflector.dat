The system geometry of static low-concentrating PV systems for building-integration with parabolic <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflectors</b> was optimised for maximum annual electricity production.

40|$|Abstract Infrared {{thermography}} uses {{infrared energy}} radiated from any objects above absolute zero temperature, {{and the range}} of its application has been constantly broadened. As one of the active test techniques detecting radiant energy generated when energy is applied to an object, ultrasound infrared thermography is a method of detecting defects through hot spots occurring at a defect area when 15 ~ 100 kHz of ultrasound is excited to an object. This technique is effective in detecting a wide range affected by ultrasound and vibration in real time. Especially, it is really effective when a defect area is minute. Therefore, this study conducted thermography through lock-in signal processing when an actual defect exists inside the austenite STS 304 seamless pipe, which simulates thermal fatigue cracks in a nuclear power plant pipe.

For such interventions, a quantified dose is vital if the treatment is to be both biologically effective and to avoid the detrimental effects of over-dosing.

Previous investigations have modelled this behaviour, and examined the impact of shaped anodized <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflectors</b> typically placed around lamps in phototherapy cabins. These mirrors are effective but tend to yield complex patterns of reflection around the cabin which can result in substantial dose inhomogeneity. There has been some speculation over whether using the reflective property of parabolic mirrors might improve dose delivery or homogeneity through the treatment cabin. In this work, the effects of parabolic mirrors are simulated and compared with standard shaped mirrors. Simulation results strongly suggest that parabolic reflectors reduce total irradiance relative to standard shaped reflectors, and have a negligible impact on dose homogeneity...|$|R

While application of both narrow-band and broad-band ultraviolet light have demonstrated great success {{in the treatment of}} a multitude of dermatological conditions, over-exposure to this section of the electromagnetic spectrum can be detrimental to human health, and the crux of the issue is striking a balance between maintaining a biologically effective dose while minimizing the impact on the overall health of the patient.

This study focused on the effect that different types of reflective materials have on the PV modules’ output. Two sets of reflectors were studied.

40|$|Secondary {{concentrators}} {{are used}} in solar concentrating systems to redirect solar beams reflected by the primary concentrators to the focal point or line. Secondary concentrators allow smaller receiver apertures (and hence lower reradiation losses) and increase the concentrated solar flux density. Solar mirrors for secondary concentrators are permanently exposed to environmental conditions, a high radiation flux and elevated temperatures that potentially cause stress and degradations throughout the time. For most solar mirrors, exposures to sunlight during service, particulary ultraviolet wavelenghts, temperature, and moisture can lead to loss in reflectance. Insufficient cooling of mirror surfaces may lead to destruction of the mirror e. g. by melting. Therefore, analyzing solar reflectors of secondary concetrators by simulating the previouse conditions is crucial. The present work is focused on studying the degradation of the mirrors by simulating accelerated exposure, caused by several ambient paramenters {{and the effect of}} concetrated radiation. It has been done under the framwork of the SFERA project. The tests were performed at two installations. The salt spray tests and weathering tests (constant and cycle temperature, damp heat and humidity) were completed at the Solar Reflectors Durability Laboratory of PSA (Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain). The high flux exposure tests of mirrors with their cooling system were performed at the Solar Technology Laboratory (STL) of PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switherland). A total of 9 selected mirror types were exposed to different levels of concentrated radiation and accelerated weathering parameters to simulate and analyze the effects caused by the ambient conditions. According to results obtained, <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflectors</b> and thin-glass silvered reflectors glued to an aluminium structure have demonstrated to be appropriate for cooled 3 D secondary concentrators (tower systems).

40|$|Lifetime {{tests of}} solar {{reflector}} materials are eligible prior to application, {{to prove the}} stability of the optical properties. In this work, six reflector materials were aged outdoors and in a climatic test chamber. The surfaces of the samples were inspected using profilometry and optical microscopy. The total and specular reflectance spectra were measured using spectrophotometry and the weighted solar reflectance values were calculated before and after ageing. Reflectors of silvered glass, anodised aluminium, thin film-coated anodised aluminium, and lacquered rolled aluminium withstood accelerated testing well, while a laminated evaporated <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflector,</b> which was specular initially, became diffuse. Laminated and lacquered reflectors withstood outdoor ageing better than expected from accelerated ageing and better than unprotected thin film-coated and anodised aluminium, which degraded significantly outdoors. Thus, optical degradation depends on climatic conditions and on the protective layer, if applicable. The discrepancy between results from outdoor and accelerated ageing shows that a thorough understanding of corrosion processes is necessary for drawing conclusions about long-term performance from accelerated ageing tests.

40|$|Photovoltaic modules in {{two-dimensional}} low-concentrating {{systems with}} specular parabolic reflectors often experience high local irradiance that causes high local currents and cell temperatures. This generally results in power losses. The use of low-angle scattering reflectors gives a smoother irradiance distribution, {{which results in}} a higher fill factor. In order to study how the choice of reflector material influences system performance, two different reflector materials (anodised aluminium and lacquered rolled aluminium laminated on a plastic substrate) were compared. The total and diffuse reflectance spectra of the reflector materials were measured, the integrated hemispherical and specular solar reflectance values calculated, and the angular distributions of scattered light investigated. Two geometrically identical 3 x concentrating photovoltaic systems with semi-parabolic over edge reflectors of the different materials were tested outdoors. While the anodised <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflector,</b> which had higher hemispherical and specular solar reflectance, resulted in a higher short-circuit current, the low-angle scattering lacquered foil gave a higher fill factor, due to a smoother image of the sun on the module surface, and an equally high calculated annual electricity production.

40|$|Thin-film silicon {{photovoltaics}} {{are seen}} as a good possibility for reducing the cost of solar electricity. The focus of this thesis is the ALICIA cell, a thin-film polycrystalline silicon solar cell made on a glass superstrate. The name ALICIA comes from the fabrication steps - ALuminium Induced Crystallisation, Ion Assisted deposition. The concept is to form a high-quality crystalline silicon layer on glass by Aluminium Induced Crystallisation (AIC). This is then the template from which to epitaxially grow the solar cell structure by Ion Assisted Deposition (IAD). IAD allows high-rate silicon epitaxy at low temperatures compatible with glass. In thin-film solar cells, light trapping is critical to increase the absorption of the solar spectrum. ALICIA cells have been fabricated on textured glass sheets, increasing light absorption due to their anti-reflection nature and light trapping properties. A 1. 8 &# 956;m thick textured ALICIA cell absorbs 55 % of the AM 1. 5 G spectrum without a back-surface reflector, or 76 % with an optimal reflector. Experimentally, Pigmented Diffuse Reflectors (PDRs) {{have been shown to be}} the best reflector. These highly reflective and optically diffuse materials increase the light-trapping potential and hence the short-circuit currents of ALICIA cells. In textured cells, the current increased by almost 30 % compared to using a simple <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflector.</b> Current densities up to 13. 7 mA/cm 2 were achieved by application of a PDR to the best ALICIA cells. The electronic quality of the absorber layer of ALICIA cells is strongly determined by the epitaxy process. Very high-rate epitaxial growth decreases the crystalline quality of the epitaxial layer, but nevertheless increases the short-circuit current density of the solar cells. This indicates that the diffusion length in the absorber layer of the ALICIA cell is primarily limited by contamination, not crystal quality. Further gains in current density can therefore be achieved by increasing the deposition rate of the absorber layer, or by improving the vacuum quality. Large-area ALICIA cells were then fabricated, and series resistance reduced by using an interdigitated metallisation scheme. The best measured efficiency was 2. 65 %, with considerable efficiency gains still possible from optimisation of the epitaxial growth and metallisation processes...|$|E

40|$|Stationary {{solar energy}} {{concentrators}} are a promising option for decreasing {{the price of}} photovoltaic electricity. This thesis studies stationary concentrators in PV/Thermal applications. The studied systems are parabolic troughs intended for building integration. The first chapters briefly explain the optics of solar energy concentrators. The theoretical maximum concentration ratios of two and three dimensional systems were derived using the concept of étendue conservation and a review of current concentrators was presented. An asymmetrically truncated compound parabolic concentrator, CPC, for flat roof integration was characterized {{as an example of}} a stationary concentrator. The current-voltage characteristics were measured, the optical efficiency was calculated, and the annual thermal and electrical output were simulated. This was done for two systems, one with <b>aluminium</b> <b>reflectors,</b> and one with <b>aluminium</b> laminated steel <b>reflectors.</b> The output estimates show no difference in annual output between the two materials. It was estimated that the bifacial system would produce 37 % more electricity than a reference mounted in the plane of the concentrator aperture. The estimated annual output of thermal energy was 145 kWh/m 2 of hot water at 50 °C. It was concluded that the system should have cells facing both the front and back reflectors to maximize the system performance. The actual output of stationary concentrators with standard photovoltaic cells is often lower than what could be expected. This is due to the highly non-uniform irradiation distribution on the cells created by the parabolic reflectors. Three microstructured reflectors in asymmetric CPC troughs were evaluated using ray tracing in an attempt to homogenize the irradiation on the cells. The simulations show that all three proposed structures reduce the peak irradiance with only small reductions in the optical efficiency. The microstructured reflectors were shown to increase the concentration ratio of the troughs which gives higher flexibility in designing new concentrators. The structured reflector troughs had a high optical efficiency when the sun was in the meridian plane, but the structures lowered the efficiency outside this plane. This was due to the disruption of the translational symmetry when the microstructured reflectors were introduced. It was concluded that structured reflectors are used at their largest benefit if they are applied in new concentrators designed for structures. For the existing designs, only a small input increase can be expected when structured reflectors are used. A new biaxial model for the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency of concentrators was presented. It is valid for translationally symmetric concentrators, flat plate collectors, and planar photovoltaic modules. It models the reflector and the cover glazing separately, and these model functions are multiplied at each angle of incidence to form the system model. The optical efficiency of the reflector was modelled as a function of the transverse angle of incidence. Existing models tend to overestimate the optical losses of the cover glazing, and the proposed model addressed this problem by modelling the optical efficiency of the glazing as a function of the true angle of incidence. The biaxial model was used to estimate the annual output of electricity from a concentrator and the estimates were compared with measurements during two summer months. The comparison showed that the proposed model is a good tool for estimating the output of photovoltaic concentrators...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, Tin-doped Indium Oxide (ITO) current {{spreading}} layer with ultra-thin silver interlayer {{has been studied}} for high brightness and low voltage GaN light-emitting diodes. Silver layer thickness and annealing condition were optimized. Our {{results show that the}} insertion of 0. 5 nm silver can remarkably reduce the forward voltage of LEDs. Additionally, high transmittance of ITO can be retained. By comparing with LEDs using Ni/Au (5 / 5 nm) p-contact, 34. 6 % light output improvement and 29. 5 % wall plug efficiency gain on average were achieved. To further improve the device performance, two-step annealing was developed to modify the reversible sheet resistance of ITO layer. LEDs treated with optimized two-step annealing show 20. 5 % wall plug efficiency gain at 100 mA compared with LEDs treated with optimized one-step annealing. Low cost ATO-based current {{spreading layer}} has been investigated. Near-UV LEDs with Ag/ITO/ATO (0. 5 / 5 / 150 nm) composite demonstrated 70 % light output enhancement with acceptable low forward voltage compared with traditional Ni/Au contact. It can be attributed to its high light transmittance near UV wavelength regime. Reverse leakage current is greatly suppressed by using such thin ITO interlayer and thick ATO overlayer because of lower indium in-diffusion which is confirmed by Secondary Ions Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). High brightness 1 x 1 mm 2 top-emitting interdigitated light-emitting diodes with different finger designs were fabricated in this study. Optimum number of finger can compromise the tradeoffs between uniform current spreading and light blocking. Experimental results show the best interdigitated LEDs can afford high current loading up to 320 mA. Furthermore, <b>aluminium</b> back <b>reflector</b> and patterned MESA structure were investigated to enhance the light output power of LEDs. Heat dissipation of high power chip can be improved by using thermal conductive silver paste and/or thinner sapphire substrate. Improved LED chips can bear even higher current injection and show higher light output power. A novel simplified LED fabrication process was proposed and presented in the latest part of this thesis. This processing can save two photolithography steps and a metal evaporation. LEDs fabricated by our simplified process show lower forward voltage and exceptionally high light output power. The forward voltage of LEDs fabricated by simplified process is 3. 51 V at 20 mA, compared to 3. 67 V obtained in conventional process. 50. 92 % light intensity improvement at 20 mA and ~ 72 % wall plug efficiency gain at high current injection level were achieved...|$|R
