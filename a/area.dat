5|$|Central <b>Area</b> was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern <b>Area,</b> Northern <b>Area,</b> {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern <b>Area</b> being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern <b>Area</b> was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new <b>area</b> command, Eastern <b>Area,</b> which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern <b>Area.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>area</b> {{commands}} {{and their}} responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands {{to begin with}} in 1940–41: Southern <b>Area,</b> Central <b>Area,</b> Western <b>Area,</b> and Northern <b>Area.</b> They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two groups that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central <b>Area</b> itself was disbanded {{and most of its}} units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed No.2 (Training) Group. The <b>area</b> structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War; Northern <b>Area</b> was split into North-Eastern <b>Area</b> and North-Western <b>Area,</b> and a new command, Eastern <b>Area,</b> was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the <b>area</b> commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new <b>area</b> command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, Northern Command, was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.|$|E

5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character.

September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{determining}} the typology of rural <b>areas</b> {{on the basis}} of internationally established methodological approaches. The attempt to define the rural <b>areas</b> in Slovenia is made {{on the basis of}} two selected methodological approaches. The first analysis employed the OECD methodology of classification of urban-rural <b>areas.</b> In order to adapt this methodology to Slovenian territory, another, indicator-based analysis was conducted, where by the indicators were selected according to a previously created typology of rural <b>areas</b> and according to Slovene legal bases. After the review and analysis of the indicators, individual types of rural <b>areas</b> were defined. The classification of rural <b>areas</b> was carried out in two steps. Firstly, three types of <b>areas</b> were determined: typical rural <b>areas,</b> transitional rural <b>areas</b> and <b>areas</b> of urban character. In the second step, <b>areas</b> were divided into demographically restricted <b>areas,</b> structure-restricted <b>areas,</b> moderately structure-restricted <b>areas</b> and predominantly developed <b>areas.</b> The comparison of these two approaches to defining rural <b>areas</b> showed that the urban-rural classification is more suitable for Slovenian conditions and that the differences between the two approaches are minimal. In both cases, the majority of <b>areas</b> are classified as intermediate and transitional rural <b>areas.</b> On the national level, both classifications show similar results. All urban <b>areas</b> are located close to the main highway cross with its centre in Ljubljana, the capital of the country. Rural <b>areas</b> as well as intermediate and transitional rural <b>areas</b> are scattered over the rest of the country’s territory without any specific pattern. Based on the comparison of the two classifications, we found out that it is impossible to define homogeneous <b>areas</b> on the basis of only one indicator and that a combination of several indicators is necessary...|$|R

The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland <b>area</b> commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern <b>Area,</b> covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern <b>Area,</b> covering New South Wales; and Southern <b>Area,</b> covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal {{was part of a}} much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime <b>area</b> command boundaries largely remained in place.

50|$|Under-nutrition is more {{prevalent}} in rural <b>areas,</b> again mainly due to low socio-economic status.
