5|$|Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 14(1), {{guarantees to}} Singapore citizens {{the rights to}} freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>expression,</b> peaceful assembly without arms, and association.

5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> to provide against contempt of court.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates spoken colloquial hybrid terms <b>and</b> <b>expressions</b> used amongst {{university}} students in Jordan, from a sociolinguistic perspective. The study attempts to explain attitudes {{and the extent}} of use by students at Yarmouk University, during Arabic discourse. This was achieved by means of questionnaires and interviewing students. The collected data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The study revealed that students highly use colloquial hybrid terms <b>and</b> <b>expressions.</b> Results also show that the use of colloquial hybrid terms <b>and</b> <b>expressions</b> is tightly related to social factors, like, age and gender; as these terms <b>and</b> <b>expressions</b> are mostly used by students aged between 18 and 20 years old, moreover, by females more than males...|$|R

5|$|Rembrandt (15 March 1977 – 30 October 2001) {{was a dark}} bay Westphalian gelding ridden for Germany by Nicole Uphoff in {{dressage}} competitions.

Although known as a sensitive horse prone to spookiness, Rembrandt's elegance <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in the ring allowed him {{to become one of}} the top horses in the sport of dressage.|$|E

Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum: Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces {{early in his}} career, before gradually moving away from this influence {{in search of his}} own style.

The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E

5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Rembrandt and Uphoff {{began to}} compete at events for young riders, and in 1986, the pair began working with Uwe Schulten-Baumer, a {{well-known}} dressage coach. In 1987, the pair began to compete, and win, at the international level. They rose {{to the top of}} the dressage world with unheard-of speed, due to Rembrandt's elegance <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> in the ring. Their rise to fame resulted in a 1988 Olympic nomination. Uphoff switched trainers four months before the Games began, leaving Schulten-Baumer to work with Harry Boldt, the German national coach.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>expression,</b> though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E

5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
5|$|Japanese voice {{recording}} {{for the game}} began two years before its release in 2008. Several voice actors had worked on other tri-Ace titles in the past. Beyond merely being given directions for their performances, the actors were able {{to contribute to the}} characters' personalities. Many characters were revised based on suggestions given by their voice actors during recording. The cast enjoyed their experience, as the game gave them the opportunity for a large range of performances, from comedic to dramatic scenes. Overall, the production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one. The English {{voice recording}} began in August 2009 under the supervision of Sega. Recording took place at studios in Los Angeles, and was overseen by Shimano and Suguro. Speaking about his view of the three main actors, Shimano was impressed, praising DiCocco's range <b>and</b> <b>expression</b> for Leanne and noting Menville's performances as Zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors.|$|E
5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission <b>and</b> <b>expression.</b> The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
