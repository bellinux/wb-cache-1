60|$|The doctor did not <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Instead, {{he looked}} reproachfully at Alexander Abraham.|$|E
60|$|If {{he did not}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> it {{at least}} seemed to suggest {{something}} to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Almayer, {{will you}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> as frankly {{as it is}} put to you?" [...] asked the lieutenant, after a long silence.|$|E
5000|$|... 4. You must {{immediately}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> without {{wasting time}} to reflect.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} curiously {{and kept his}} eyes fixed on me while he <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|A {{door opened}} softly behind me. Naomi herself {{appeared}} on the threshold; Naomi herself <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Frankly, I do not," [...] {{the doctor}} answered. [...] "And yet {{treat it as}} a whim of mine and <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Supposing I should?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, by G----! Nor shall you be. Where is she? If {{you do not}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> I {{shall have}} {{recourse}} to the police at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will you, or {{will you}} not, <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> Sir?' 'If you don't answer the question, you'll be committed, Sir,' {{interposed}} the little judge, looking over his note-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Relieved, so far, I {{naturally}} {{asked what}} had happened. Penrose betrayed a marked embarrassment in <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
40|$|Stephen Taylor, my advisor, whose guidance, {{comments}} and criticisms were pivotal in {{the completion of}} this work. Daniel Maskit and Rich Lethin for lengthy discussions on the subject, and <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> about the Multiflow compiler. Yevgeny Gurevich for providing the runtime system and tools essential for this project, and also for <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> and requests in a timely manner, day or night. Stephen Keckler, for help with the M-Machine simulator. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cosmopolites always do. Now <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> What {{were you}} up to?' and Dare {{as he spoke}} played with the pistol again.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you do not}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Do {{you bring}} any {{accusation}} against me? If so, I {{agree with you that}} you had better go to your lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop that talk, Brown!" [...] {{commanded}} Colonel Colby. [...] "I {{want you}} and Martell to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Why {{did you go}} over there and shoot those cows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kindly <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Would the prisoner, in {{the hottest}} week {{of a hot}} summer, be likely {{to go to a}} drawer {{containing}} winter underclothing. Yes, or no?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Knowing and {{understanding}} your rights as I have explained them to you, {{are you willing}} to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> without an attorney present? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That depends," [...] said I, sternly, [...] "upon {{whether you}} <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> without telling me a lie, {{as you did}} Captain Croker just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> Miss Smithers, and do {{not comment}} on them. How did you come, then, to submit {{yourself}} to such a disagreeable operation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] ses the skipper, [...] "but <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> If you {{can tell}} us any marks your ’usband had, we can take Bill down into my cabin and——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{insist on}} knowing what binds {{you to that}} man," [...] I said. [...] "Let him come back! If you won't <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> I will put it to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Baroness gave {{a little}} laugh. [...] "You are {{thinking}} only of yourself, and you don't <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> While you are amusing yourself--with the brilliant Gertrude--what shall I be doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably," [...] I suggested, [...] "your twelve American admirers {{attached}} {{more importance}} to the ceremony than I do. But you haven't <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> yet." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{could not}} be true, because up to then he had {{understood}} it perfectly; at least, he <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> exactly as if he did.|$|R
6000|$|Lawton: [...] "I've {{no doubt}} he wishes I had a glass eye--two of them, for that matter. But that isn't <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Where is Mrs. Somers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's only a rabbit," [...] he said, impatiently. [...] "Never {{mind that}} now, but <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Do you dare {{to tell me}} {{that you are going to}} throw me over?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said I, very sternly, [...] "you will {{be pleased}} to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> for I tell you plain that I am in no humor for jesting upon this occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{put that}} aside," [...] he smiled again, a little dangerously. [...] "You have still to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Having volunteered for war service doesn't prevent your being engaged to me, does it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Signore; {{have the}} {{goodness}} to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> I called the felucca ze Ving-and-Ving; and I called myself le Capitaine Smeet; {{is it not}} true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Admitting all this, Beth," [...] {{returned}} her uncle, [...] "you are not <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> What {{shall we do}} for Myrtle? How can we best assist her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{glanced down}} at the new patent leathers which I was wearing. [...] "How on earth--" [...] I began, but Holmes <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> before it was asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} I need trouble you to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> which, indeed, now that I think of it, was one I {{had no right to}} put," [...] he said as she {{recovered}} herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--she is to {{come with}} my father later. She is here no doubt, now. But <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> Mr. Finn;--unless you find that you cannot answer it. What was it that you did say to my husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well,’ she said, ‘here is {{a bright}} florin, with which you may {{purchase}} both the one and the other; and I shall give it you at once, if you will <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> The clay bear or the china monkey—come?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as to <b>answer</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> simply, and do {{not make}} {{unnecessary}} remarks, sir. Was the drogue attached when the boat came up? Yes or no?" ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would not}} have been able to {{complete}} this dissertation without the help of many people who have contributed to make this project achievable and enjoyable. To Didier Roche who <b>answered</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> and gave us useful advices. A particular thanks for Gabriele Wolfe, Jacqueline Ezman and Stef Antiek to let me interviews some of their consumers.
