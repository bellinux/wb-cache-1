40|$|The {{original}} contribution of this thesis is the insight that photography is better served through {{the philosophy of}} difference than through the metaphysics of identity. This thesis takes seriously the mechanically produced image in order to claim that its technologies {{can be considered as}} the method that allows access to the subjective modes within difference and develops them in relation to the specifically photographic conditions of production: repetition, simulacra and the latent image. This thesis proposes that considering photography {{from the point of view}} of the content of the image is a false move as it necessarily brings in the question of the subject (a key concern for philosophy), narrowly understood as the immobile centre for which the world is represented as meaning, Rather than pursuing photography as text, which brings in the problem of language. this thesis suggests that visuality - understood as fragmentary and recursive selfreplication – is nothing other than photography's pull away from representation and pointing to the way difference, as multiplicity of open-ended possibilities, could be approached as the sine-qua-non for photography. This thesis not only shows that visuality can never be fully understood as representation and requires the untamed environment of difference, but that in so doing one realises that philosophy of visuality is nothing other than photography. This has the additional outcome inasmuch as it also begins to pull away at the whole edifice of metaphysics itself, which opens up <b>another</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> that leads not only out of thinking metaphysically. but also out of thinking humanly. These are wildly creative paths, and this thesis is pointing in the direction that can be taken without however solving these questions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Coiled coil {{proteins}} {{emerge as}} important determinants of bacterial cellular organization. Several such proteins display properties characteristic to metazoan intermediate filament (IF) proteins, {{and are therefore}} designated bacterial IF-like proteins. The best studied examples of the latter are crescentin in Caulobacter crescentus that determines the curved cell shape, and FilP (filament forming-protein) in Streptomyces. The aim of this thesis was further characterization of the bacterial IF-like protein FilP in the medically and industrially important model organisms of genus Streptomyces, which are multicellular and mycelial bacteria. Previously, it was shown that FilP spontaneously and without any co-factor polymerizes into filaments in vitro, and that FilP is required for maintaining regular stiffness, elasticity and morphology of the hyphae. In this study we showed that FilP can assemble into tightly interconnected network structure in vitro, {{that is likely to}} possess high viscoelasticity, which can explain the role of FilP in hyphal stiffness. By immuno-staining technique FilP was shown to localize to the apical portions of the hyphae in a form of a gradient during active growth. Fluorescence time-lapse microscopy using fluorescently tagged derivatives of FilP showed that the FilP cytoskeleton is dynamically remodeled during growth, and that several different mechanisms including degradation, contribute to the turnover of FilP cytoskeleton and dynamically maintain the apical gradients of the FilP network. Additionally, our data showed that FilP is recruited the tips of the hyphae via an interaction with DivIVA, the determinant of Streptomyces polar growth. We propose a model whereby DivIVA recruits FilP to the apical regions to provide a mechanical support to the intrinsically weak tips of hyphae during a growth. <b>Another</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> pursued in this thesis was to study the cell-biological aspects of osmotic stress response. We revealed a so far uncharacterized cellular response of Streptomyces to hyperosmotic stress, which involved complete reprogramming of cell polarity and redistribution of growth sites from hyphal tips to lateral walls, resulting in extensive de novo branch formation. Besides re-arrangement of coiled coil cytoskeletons DivIVA and FilP this response also involved hyper-condensation of nucleoids, slow recovery of turgor, and a change in the fluidity of the cytoplasm. In summary, my study has revealed several new aspects concerning the working principles of the IF-like FilP cytoskeleton, and might even offer insights into the so far poorly understood role of the IF cytoskeleton in metazoan cells. Our cell-biological study of osmotic stress response has shed new light on bacterial stress responses, which have seldom been studied on single-cell level...|$|E

The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme farnesyl transferase. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for progeria and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, lonafarnib and tipifarnib, are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> treatment for children suffering from laminopathic progeria.

40|$|Contamination {{of maize}} grain by the fungus, Aspergillus flavus, is {{reaching}} worrying levels {{in many areas}} of West Africa. This infection of grain may be responsible for the rising number of nutritional disorders of children as the fungal toxins, or aflatoxins, are known to be dangerous to human health. A recent survey of farm grain stores in Benin by researchers of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has revealed high contamination levels. In the north of the country, the researchers found that over half the maize grain had become contaminated after four months in storage. In the south of the country, about one-third of the grain was infected with A. flavus. The researchers noted, too, that farmers seemed unaware that their grain was infected with aflatoxins The different storage systems used in {{the north and the south}} of Benin may account for some of the difference. In the north, grain is stored in clay containers with a thatch roof, and these materials may be harbouring the fungal spores from one season to the next. In the south, farmers tend to use more open structures such as raised stacks. The researchers are reluctant to put all the blame on the store structures. Work in the USA has shown that if maize is stressed during the growing season the grain can crack, leaving it vulnerable to infection while still in the field. The difficult growing conditions of the north, with uncertain rainfall, could also be a major cause of infection: the researchers found, in some areas that maize was harvested with A. flavus on the grain. Ways to prevent infection are now being researched: plant breeders are trying to establish whether some cultivars are more tolerant of infection than others, and efforts are being made to see whether storage structures can be improved. <b>Another</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> is to see if grain can be treated before it goes into store. Several traditional medicinal plants have been tried, and there has been some success. Spraying a solution made from a mixture of two plant extracts onto the grain as it went into store stopped the growth of the fungus. Leaving the husk on the cobs also seems to help reduce infection. Dr. Kitty Cardwell, who leads the IITA research, feels that the survey showed the problem to be more serious than originally thought. She is convening a conference, which will be held in Cotonou, Benin, next November, to discuss the problem and to bring together researchers, agriculturalists and health workers to review this problem.

40|$|While much {{research}} into the field of ionic liquids has described applications for which these new and facile materials can be used, {{the origins of the}} desirable physical properties (i. e. high ionic conductivity, large electrochemical windows, high thermal stability, etc.), remains subject to empirical understanding and guess-work. The investigation of new salts from the> 1010 possibilities can be cumbersome as time is invested in either a wide range of promising materials that may yield limited success, or through systematic testing of whole families of ionic liquids to find the best performing material. Developing an understanding of the role different ions and functional groups play in the bulk physical properties of an ionic liquid is crucial in guiding future research to uncover modem materials for advanced practical applications. This work first analyses the physical properties of many different ionic liquids to gain insight into the liquid state of pure ionic liquids. Viscosity, ionic conductivity and density data are used to construct Walden Plots, to understand the freedom of movement of ions in the electrolyte, based on the Walden rule that states that the product of molar conductivity and viscosity is constant. It is proposed in this work that the observed deviation from this relationship is influenced {{by the size of the}} ions. Based on estimates of ion size using ab initio calculations, new deviations in molar conductivity in the Walden Plot (~W) are determined. Furthermore, using the Nernst-Einstein equation, ionicity values are determined from diffusion NMR analysis. The pure state IS also probed in detail for the ionic liquid trihexyltetradecylphosphonim chloride ([P 6, 6, 6, 14](Cl]) using wide angle X-ray scattering coupled with molecular dynamics simulations. Nanometer sized domains are observed in the liquid state, which is correlated by the computer simulations. These domains alternate between polar and non-polar, reflecting aggregation of the charged ions and aggregation of the uncharged alkyl chains on the phosphonium cation. While there are many new ionic liquids to explore, <b>another</b> <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> that is beginning to bloom is the study of mixtures of ionic liquids. The most obvious starting point is perhaps the study of ionic liquids combined with molecular solvents, as these latter materials have well documented and accurately measured properties. However, some of the properties that are so heavily sought after in ionic liquids are sacrificed in such mixtures. In contrast, ionic liquids mixed with other ionic liquids offer the possibility of improvement of undesirable properties without the loss of advantageous properties such as negligible volatility. As there is an overwhelmingly large range of ionic liquid in ionic liquid possible combinations, though, a guided and well constructed approach is required to make significant headway in the field. This work presents the study of a group of ionic liquids where the differences in constituent ions are chosen to yield significant information on how different ions interact, while the number of differences is kept to a minimum to avoid too many competing factors. The concept of "simple" mixing, in terms of the properties of ionic liquid mixtures, is clarified first in order to identify any unusual behaviour. Thus, equations for predicting viscosities in mixtures are confirmed, and analogous equations are used to describe molar conductivities. The greatest deviation from simple mixing is observed in mixtures of the N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium ([C 3 mpyrt]+) cation and the large [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ cation, used with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide ([NTf 2]*) anion. These mixtures exhibit an immiscibility window, a lack of crystallisation in single phase mixtures, a large excess molar volume and significant departure from the expected viscosity. It is conjectured that the physical properties of the miscible composition in this mixture is the result of alkyl-rich domains in the liquid state, and that when the composition of [C 3 mpyr][NTf 2] is in the majority these domains cannot stay in solution and force the ionic liquids to separate. In order to accurately perform NMR diffusion analyses of the ionic liquid binary mixtures, the exact procedure for the NMR diffusion experiments needed to be explored and clarified. It is observed that the standard pulse sequence traditionally used for diffusion experiments, the Hahn-Echo pulse sequence, yields anomalous results in high viscosity ionic liquids. As only the most fluid of ionic liquids give consistent results with this standard procedure a different pulse sequence is required. The stimulated echo sequence is shown to have no viscosity dependence and is therefore recommended for PFG-NMR studies on ionic liquids. Finally, mixtures of ionic liquids and molecular solvents will produce materials that are useful in some applications, and this work presents a study comparing analysis based on transport properties (Le. the Walden plot) against studies of the vapour pressure (Le. osmotic coefficient and activities). It is shown that both techniques give evidence of ion aggregation at low concentrations, but deviate from one another above - 0. 3 mole fraction ionic liquid. This is attributed to breakdown of the validity of osmotic coefficient measurements at high salt concentrations. An effect of solvent polarity on ion aggregation is also observed. This work gives significant advances in the probing of the state of ions within an ionic liquid, and gives insights into how ions interact with each other, other ionic liquids and molecular solvents. The findings here can serve as a basis for developing new ionic liquids, as well as direct investigations for new ionic liquid mixtures...|$|E

40|$|The life {{expectancy}} of patients with schizophrenia is reduced by between 15 and 25 years. Those patients dying of natural causes die of the same diseases as in the general population. In 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) identified underlying global risk factors for mortality in the general population. However, {{there is little evidence}} in the literature assessing their validity in those with schizophrenia. The WHO report on global health risks (2009) identifies hypertension, smoking, raised glucose, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, and high cholesterol as the six leading global mortality risk factors. Currently, there are minimal data on the contribution to mortality that these risk factors make in schizophrenia, and their optimum management. Both short and long-term studies are needed to address these gaps. New research has raised important questions about risk balance with regards to ideal body mass, with some studies showing that being overweight is associated with lower all-cause mortality and lower suicide rates. Cardiorespiratory fitness is being recognized as a more powerful predictor of mortality than smoking, hypertension or diabetes in men.
