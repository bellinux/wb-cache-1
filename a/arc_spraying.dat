50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), <b>arc</b> <b>spraying</b> and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|E

Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> aluminium coating. In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using wire <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance. The tests indicated that all samples had passed the minimum requirement with an average of 10 MPa for Pull off Test and no crack appeared in Bend Test. Hardness Test and Surface Morphology Analysis were also performed with coating thickness ranged between 350 - 400 microns to inspect and evaluate the coating properties. The hardness test showed an average value of 209. 7 HV. Surface morphology analysis using FE-SEM indicated low porosity structures and high content of oxide.
