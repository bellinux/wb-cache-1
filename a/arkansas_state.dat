5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State,</b> establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|<b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> 32-yard line. This time, <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, Ball State {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Ball State {{jumped out}} to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State,</b> and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately <b>Arkansas</b> <b>State</b> held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
