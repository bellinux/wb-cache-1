5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E

5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating an illusion of finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E

TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Different {{authors have}} {{variously}} reported the birth length at between , and the maturation length at between , with females usually maturing at a slightly larger size than males. This range of sizes may reflect life history differences in crossback stingarees across {{different parts of}} its range. Both sexes mature at around six years of age, and can live to at least 11 years. The crossback stingaree may hybridize naturally with the closely related yellowback stingaree off southern New South Wales, where the distributions of the two species overlap <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> hybrid offspring with intermediate color patterns have been found.

5|$|It {{continued}} to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This {{is believed to}} be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Lying a {{few degrees}} west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star; this is a yellow subgiant of {{spectral}} type G8IV <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a red dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while Gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.|$|E
5|$|Perceval {{had led the}} Tory {{government}} since 1809, during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, {{when he had been}} imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> certainty that his action was justified, raised questions about his sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions.|$|E
5|$|Three star systems {{appear to}} have planets. HD 9446 is a sun-like star around 171 light-years distant that has two planets of masses 0.7 and 1.8 times that of Jupiter, with orbital periods of 30 and 193 days respectively. WASP-56 is a sun-like star of {{spectral}} type G6 <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of Jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days. HD 13189 is an orange giant of spectral type K2II about 2–7 times as massive as the sun with a planetary or brown dwarf companion between 8 and 20 times as massive as Jupiter, which takes 472 days to complete an orbit. It {{is one of the}} largest stars discovered to have a planetary companion.|$|E

5|$|While not {{a bright}} constellation, Corona Australis is {{nonetheless}} distinctive {{due to its}} easily identifiable pattern of stars, which {{has been described as}} horseshoe- or oval-shaped. Though it has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5). Nicolas Louis de Lacaille used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. Mu Coronae Australis, a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude 5.21, was labelled by Johann Elert Bode and retained by Benjamin Gould, who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.|$|E
5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W. H. Auden. His work {{has been seen as}} an early contribution to ecology and in particular to phenology. The book has been enjoyed for its charm <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> simplicity, and the way that it creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Coronae Australis is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth. The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum {{due to its}} rotation. Its spectral type is B9V. Theta Coronae Australis lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude 4.62. Corona Australis harbours RX J1856.5-3754, an isolated neutron star that is thought to lie 140 (±40) parsecs, or 460 (±130) light years, away, with a diameter of 14km. It was once suspected to be a strange star, but this has been discounted.|$|E

5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture telescope on a dark night. The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.|$|E
5|$|No.33 Squadron, {{operating}} ex-Qantas Short Empire flying {{boats and}} several smaller transports, {{was raised in}} NEA on 19February 1942. Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at Port Moresby, {{due to lack of}} air cover <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> lack of interest from government echelons. On 25February, Nos.3 and 4Fighter Sector Headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations; they were based at Townsville and Port Moresby respectively. Seventeen P-40 Kittyhawks of No.75 Squadron, recently formed at Townsville, were deployed to Port Moresby in mid-March. Commanded by Squadron Leader John Jackson, the squadron suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground, securing Port Moresby until relieved by the 35th and 36th Squadrons of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), operating P-39 Airacobras.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant <b>and</b> <b>apparent</b> regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E
