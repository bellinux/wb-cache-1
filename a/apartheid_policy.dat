25|$|The South African cricket team toured India in the 1991-92 season. The {{tour was}} {{significant}} {{in that it}} was South Africa's first official international cricket series since their suspension from the sport in 1970 due to the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brian Lee Irvine (born 9 March 1944 in Durban, South Africa) was a cricketer {{who played}} four Tests for South Africa in 1969–70 {{in the last}} Test series played by South Africa before {{official}} sporting links were broken over the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
25|$|When South Africa {{was banned}} from {{international}} cricket {{because of the}} country's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy,</b> the team's two lucrative tours to England in 1970 and to Australia in 1971–72 were cancelled. The cricket authorities responded by forming Rest of the World teams to play unofficial Test series in lieu and these teams included some leading South African players. Sobers was invited to captain the Rest of the World in both series.|$|E

25|$|The ban on South Africa {{restricted}} his Test {{career to}} a mere seven appearances, all of them against Australia, between 1967 and 1970. 41 Test wickets {{at an average of}} 15.02 suggest what he might have achieved in the coming years had South Africa not enacted a racist <b>Apartheid</b> <b>policy,</b> which had their international sporting teams banned. Along with Barry Richards and Graeme Pollock, Procter was responsible in his side inflicting two successive series defeats on Australia by margins of 3–1 and 4–0.|$|E
25|$|This activist {{group was}} created in 1985 by Van Zandt and record {{producer}} Arthur Baker. Van Zandt and Baker assembled over 54 different artists to record an album entitled Sun City {{in order to raise}} awareness about the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> in South Africa. The title referred to a resort in South Africa that catered to wealthy white tourists. The resort upheld racist apartheid policies, yet many famous entertainers chose to perform there. Artists that took part in the making of the album included Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's chief administrator, Walter Hadlee, had {{advocated}} a compromise from the start. Now {{he had no}} objection to WSC making a brief tour of his country in November, nor {{was he going to}} stop the Kiwis' best player, his son Richard, from appearing with WSC. The South Africans, subject to an international boycott caused by the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> of their government, were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world’s best. Some were prepared to acclaim South Africa as the best side of the world {{on the basis of the}} performances of some of their players in WSC.|$|E

25|$|In all, ten {{national}} women's {{teams have}} competed in Test cricket. The England team's tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1934–35 season established {{the first three}} sides, and it is those three teams that have competed in Test cricket most frequently; each having played at least 45 matches. South Africa were the next side to play the format, contesting their first match in 1960. However, {{due in part to}} their exclusion from international sport due to the nation's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy,</b> they have only played in eleven Test matches, less than both India and the West Indies. Four sides—Pakistan, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sri Lanka—have all competed in fewer than five Test matches.|$|E
25|$|International {{isolation}} was keenly {{felt by the}} South African team at the time, including Pollock, and {{the players}} took measures to try to reverse the looming sporting boycott. In 1971, Pollock {{took part in a}} protest organised by Barry Richards and Mike Procter against the South African government's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> as it referred to cricket. During a match to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Republic of South Africa, the players from both teams walked off after one ball, issuing a joint statement: We cricketers feel {{that the time has come}} for an expression of our views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association's application to invite non-whites to tour Australia, if they are good enough, and further subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.|$|E
500|$|On February 12, 1982, {{following}} the poor {{sales of the}} medallions, the United States Gold Commission recommended the minting of a gold coin. Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury {{and chairman of the}} commission, later told reporters that a gold coin could be easier to sell than medallions, because the suggested coins [...] "could be redeemable in dollars". [...] The Mint issued gold coins for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty in 1986. [...] Both issues were successful, and the Liberty piece sold out on advance sales. [...] As the public was receptive to the gold coins, and President Ronald Reagan had banned the importation of Krugerrands in 1985 over South Africa's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy,</b> Congress authorized the American Gold Eagle gold bullion coin, which entered production as legal tender in 1986.|$|E

500|$|The 1981 South African tour to New Zealand sparked {{protests against}} South Africa's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy,</b> {{the likes of}} which had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 {{waterfront}} dispute. The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport. Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour's provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest. The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading [...] "Biko" [...] and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour {{had a significant impact on}} New Zealand society.|$|E
500|$|From a cricketing viewpoint, the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> {{made little}} difference. Although cricket was played widely among the {{different}} racial groups in South Africa, the Test team, which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white. Under apartheid, this became official policy under the government reasoning that black, coloured (mixed race) and Indian players were inherently inferior and not worthy of selection. Different races were forbidden from competing against each other. South African cricket teams did not compete against India, Pakistan or the West Indies, but teams from England, Australia and New Zealand continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received {{and the quality of}} living. The political writer and historian Peter Oborne commented: [...] "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, that there was something wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|International feeling against South Africa's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> became {{stronger}} and more vociferous as the post-war era developed. [...] Until the mid-1960s, however, the South Africa national cricket team continued to play regularly and without undue difficulty against Australia, England and New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|Tutu {{compared}} the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party {{to the ideas}} of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> and the Holocaust. He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result.|$|E
2500|$|International cricket in South Africa between 1971 and 1981 {{consisted}} of four private tours arranged by English sports promoter Derrick Robins, two tours {{by a private}} team called the [...] "International Wanderers", and one women's Test match. The <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> followed by the South African Governments of the day meant that no Test match playing nation was willing to tour, thereby depriving world cricket of leading stars such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards, Clive Rice and Eddie Barlow.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> {{followed}} by the South African Governments of the day meant that no Test match playing nation was willing to tour South Africa. Lewington {{was a member of}} DH Robins' XI January–February 1973 tour, with the team referred to as the [...] "International Wanderers". During the tour he played 3 first-class matches against Western Province, Natal and Combined Section B XI. During the tour he took 4 wickets for the DH Robins' XI at an average of 69.75, with best figures of 2/56.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962 the South African {{government}} {{set up the}} Odendaal Commission which {{recommended that}} the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> be implemented in South West Africa, including the setting up of bantustans. Not all {{the recommendations of the}} Odendaal Commission were implemented. In 1969, shortly after Colin Winter became bishop, the South African government undertook a [...] "rearrangement", which would make Namibia more like a province of South Africa. Control of several government departments was transferred to Pretoria in order to apply the [...] "homelands" [...] policy.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock and the South Africans {{were due}} to play England at home in 1968–69, but {{tensions}} stemming from the South African government's <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> {{came to a head}} when South African-born Basil D'Oliveira—of Cape Coloured ancestry—was chosen in the England touring team to replace the injured Tom Cartwright. The South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster denounced the English team as the [...] "team of the anti-apartheid" [...] movement and refused to allow the team to enter South Africa with D'Oliveira in place. The tour was therefore cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|After his retirement, Barlow {{became more}} active in espousing his liberal views against the <b>apartheid</b> <b>policy</b> then in place in his homeland. He took up a post as Director of the South African Sports Office in London and {{afterwards}} he became a cricket coach. [...] He was appointed coach at Gloucestershire but owing to his father's death had to leave after two seasons. [...] He coached Orange Free State and then Transvaal. [...] He then became the first coach of the newly formed Super Juice Academy which was based in the Western Cape and was a feeder for Western Province and Boland cricket.|$|E
40|$|Even {{with the}} end of {{apartheid}} in South Africa, the impact of apartheid-like policies on economic growth remains an important policy issue. Our results, from two panels of ‘peer’ countries, which were roughly comparable to South Africa, show that <b>apartheid</b> <b>policies</b> that led to insufficient investment in physical and human capital and high shares of government consumption contributed to South Africa's poor growth performance during apartheid. We also find some support for the hypothesis that <b>apartheid</b> <b>policies</b> caused low productivity and inefficient use of inputs, but South Africa's abundance of natural resources at times obscured this effect. ...|$|R
