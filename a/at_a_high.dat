5|$|Although at {{an unusual}} latitude, the storm {{maintained}} this intensity {{for over a}} day before weakening to a tropical storm. During the afternoon of August13, the small system re-intensified into a hurricane. Reconnaissance reported that gale-force winds extended no more than 100mi (155km) from the storm's eye. Shortly thereafter, the system further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 105mph (160km/h). Weather maps at the time depicted the storm as having a minimum pressure of 987mbar (hPa). By August14, the storm began to weaken once more, gradually becoming a tropical storm on August15. After tunrning northward, the cyclone became extratropical <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> latitude of 39.8°N.|$|E
5|$|Although the Battle of Santa Cruz was a {{tactical}} {{victory for the}} Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> cost for their naval forces, as Jun'yō was the only active aircraft carrier left to challenge Enterprise or Henderson Field {{for the remainder of}} the Guadalcanal campaign. Zuikaku, despite being undamaged and having recovered the aircraft from the two damaged carriers, returned to home islands via Truk for training and aircraft ferrying duties, only returning to the South Pacific in February 1943 to cover the evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal. Both damaged carriers were forced to return to Japan for extensive repairs and refitting. After repair, Zuihō returned to Truk in late January 1943. Shōkaku was under repair until March 1943 and did not return to the front until July 1943, when she was reunited with Zuikaku at Truk.|$|E
5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> risk of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also {{learn how to use}} a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

Colonel Julio Soto Villanueva ordered 1,500 Spanish Regulars of the 24th Rifle Battalion, six companies of the Alfonso XIII auxiliaries, and other scattered Spanish and Puerto Rican guerilla forces dispatched from the garrison at Mayagüez to meet and defeat Schwan.
