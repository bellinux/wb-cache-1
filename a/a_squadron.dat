BSquadron patrolled the Indian brigade's flank near Bir Gibni and was fired on by German Panzer III tanks. One Panzer III was disabled by 2-pounder anti-tank guns, and was towed away by a retreating Panzer. B Squadron pulled back a mile at night and laagered. At 15:00 on 19 November, the regiment advanced towards Bir Gibni, with C Squadron forward and <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> in reserve. C Squadron reached the Trigh el Abd and observed the British 4th Armoured Brigade fighting a battle group from the 21st Panzer Division.

5|$|Implacable {{temporarily}} {{became a}} trials carrier in October 1947 {{as her own}} air group was not yet ready and she was refitted from October to December 1948 in preparation of service as the Home Fleet flagship. She embarked <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> each of de Havilland Sea Hornets and Blackburn Firebrands in April 1949 and became the flagship of Admiral Sir Philip Vian on 29 April. <b>A</b> <b>squadron</b> of de Havilland Sea Vampires flew from her deck later that year and her air group was augmented by <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> of Fairey Barracudas in 1950. Implacable was placed in reserve in September 1950 and slowly converted into a training ship {{by the addition of}} extra accommodation and classrooms, including the addition of a deckhouse on her flight deck. She was recommissioned on January 1952 as the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron.

Then-prince Wilhelmthe future Kaiser Wilhelm IIwas also present for the cruise, aboard Blitz. The flotilla was back in German waters for the annual AugustSeptember maneuvers, where it formed the IV Division. By 1888, Blitz had been transferred to the III Flotilla. In July, Blitz joined <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> of ships to take the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II for a tour of Baltic ports, which included a visit to Tsar Alexander III of Russia.

5|$|In December 1969 B Squadron was re-designated <b>A</b> <b>Squadron,</b> {{while in}} December 1970 <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> was in turn re-designated C Squadron. By late-1970 Australia was {{beginning}} to reduce its commitment to {{the war and the}} size of 1ATF was again reduced from three infantry battalions to two. The tanks, however, continued operations and were involved in heavy fighting at Long Khanh on 6–7 June 1971, as well as numerous smaller actions. The last elements of the regiment were subsequently withdrawn from Vietnam in September 1971. A total of 58 Centurions had served in Vietnam; 42 had suffered battle damage, of which six were beyond repair, while two crewmen had been killed in action.|$|E

5|$|On 5 June, {{the main}} part of the {{regiment}} was combined with two companies of infantry and <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> of tanks to form Wilder Force, which was to take over the front from the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade. <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> pushed up the valley and Wilder Force advanced behind, through Balsorano. After the Axis retreated to their next line of defence, the New Zealand Division withdrew to Arce for training. The regiment moved forward again on 10 July, advancing to Cortona on 11–12 July. BSquadron was transferred to 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and sent forward to Castiglion Fiorentino to clear the road between Castiglion and Palazzo del Pero. The road was opened by the 6th Armoured Division, and the crossroads on Route 73 was reached on 15 July. The New Zealand Division moved to capture Florence; the regiment advanced west to Siena and then turned north to Castellina. <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> supported the 23rd and 28th Battalions advancing on San Casciano and the remainder of the regiment arrived at San Donato by 22 July. Two days later, C Squadron combined with <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> of the 19th Armoured Brigade, No. 2 Company of the 22nd Battalion and 1st Troop of the 31st Anti-tank Battery to form Armcav. The force advanced on 25 July, taking Fabbrica and advancing toward Bibbione. Bibbione was taken despite determined opposition the next day and the other two squadrons supported the Maori Battalion. Armcav was disbanded on 27 July and C Squadron remained under the command of the 4th Armoured Brigade.|$|E
5|$|On 8 and 9 January 1943, Div Cav {{advanced}} again. The <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> vehicles at Nofilia {{were loaded}} on transporters, which {{drove down the}} main road {{while the rest of}} the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance. The <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti-tank guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German anti-tank guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E

5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|San Casciano was {{captured}} shortly afterwards {{and the final}} assault on Florence began on 1 August. <b>A</b> <b>Squadron</b> was in reserve and B Squadron patrolled northward.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain.

However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that such <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>squadron</b> {{of three}} galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived to {{reinforce}} the city on 17 March, but to little avail.
