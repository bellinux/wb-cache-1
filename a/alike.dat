5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated <b>alike,</b> but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated <b>alike.</b> Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E

5|$|British {{nationality}} law as it {{pertains to}} Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, these {{religious}} {{houses were}} regarded by City traders as interlopers — occupying what had previously been public open space nearby one of the City gates. On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women <b>alike</b> came to worship.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{was well}} known for having a bad disposition, he has been {{described}} as surly, and having a volatile temper. Other sources add to that: mean, contemptuous, and uncommunicative.

5|$|Despite {{the high}} value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low social status among the Greeks and Romans, who {{regarded}} artists, artisans, and craftsmen <b>alike</b> as manual labourers.

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting <b>alike</b> from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers <b>alike.</b> The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran {{along the length of}} the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Equality before law: Article 14 of the {{constitution}} guarantees that all people shall be equally protected {{by the laws of}} the country. It means that the State will treat people in the same circumstances <b>alike.</b> This article also means that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.|$|E
5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated <b>alike,</b> but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated <b>alike.</b> Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
