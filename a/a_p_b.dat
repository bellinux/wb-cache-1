Later, he served the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune as a director's grade {{scientist}} and headed the Physical Chemistry division of the institution. Continuing his researches on solid state chemistry, he studied low mobility semiconductors with respect to its electron transport and crystal distortions caused by electron lattice transitions, switching, magnetic ordering and memory effects. He {{is known to have}} synthesized new manganites and reportedly developed a number of solid state products such as thermistors, photocells, magnets and photovoltaic products. Based on his studies on electron lattice interaction, he proposed support theories for the ferroelectricity theory and developed new theories on the thermoelectrical power and mobility in semiconductors. His researches are reported to have widened the understanding of conduction in semiconductors. The body of his literary work is composed of one book, Spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry, chapters to the book, A study of the growth and structure of layers of oxides, sulphides and related compounds, with special reference to the effect of temperature, edited by C.

Nadalje, utvrdit će se naglasne varijacije u ostalim, posebice dodirnim, istraženim štokavskim govorima. This {{paper is}} based on {{materials}} gathered {{in the field and}} provides a synchronic overview of the accent paradigms of adjectives in the Slivno municipality speech varieties found in Slivno Ravno, Mihalj, Blace and Podgradina. These speeches belong to the Eastern Herzegovinian border dialect and the Slivno-Zažablje speech type. Furthermore, accent variations in the other explored Štokavian speeches will be determined. Root (suffix-less) adjectives in the Slivno municipality speech varieties do not show the old a. p. a and <b>a.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>b,</b> but are mostly formed {{as a part of the}} a. p. C: lȁk – làka – lȁko ‘easy’, which connects these speech varieties with the Makarska and Vrgorac municipality speech varie-ties. All the speeches have well preserved authentic a. p. c in adjectives such as glȗv – glúva – glȗvo ‘deaf’ and mȍćan – mòćna – mȍćno ‘mighty’ (SR, Mi, Bl) / mȍćan – mòćna – mȍćno (Po), and in adjectives such as ȍpāk ‘tough’, vȅsevo ‘happy’ and kȑvav ‘bloody’. The only innovation is found in adjectives with a long root ending in –an: ládan – ládna – lȃdno ‘cold’, where the authentic long falling accent in m. changes into the long rising one, thus becoming a. p. C 1, or it changes to a. p. B: rúžan – rúžna – rúžno ‘ugly’. Adjectives ending in –an have preserved the form of the old a. p. b: dúžan – dúžna – dúžno ’indebted’, which distinguishes the Slivno municipality speech varieties from those of Vrgorac and Imotski where paradigms are mixed and where the a. p.
