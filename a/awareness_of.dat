Age and gender affects were tested for <b>awareness,</b> source <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> and recall <b>of</b> supermarket practising food-related private-label brands. Results revealed that gender affects brand <b>awareness</b> and source <b>of</b> <b>awareness,</b> while age affects recall of the supermarket.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{much work}} has been {{dedicated}} by logicians, computer scientists and economists to understanding awareness, as its importance for human behaviour becomes evident. Although several logics <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> have been proposed, {{little attention has been}} explicitly dedicated to change in <b>awareness.</b> However, one <b>of</b> the most crucial aspects <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> is the changes it undergoes, which have countless important consequences for knowledge and action. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a formal model <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> change, and to derive from it logics <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> change. In the first part of the paper, the model of epistemic states of bounded agents proposed in Hill (Stud Log 89 (1) : 81 - 109, 2008 a) is extended with operations modelling awareness change. In the second part of the paper, it is shown how this model naturally extends the "standard" logic <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> to yield a logic <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> change...|$|R

40|$|Attention and {{awareness}} are intimately related concepts. Nevertheless, the two phenomena are empirically dissociable: visuo-spatial attention can {{act in the}} absence <b>of</b> visual <b>awareness.</b> We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record cortical neural activity from hemianopic patient GY while he performed a peripheral orientation-discrimination task {{in the context of}} an attention-cueing paradigm. The luminance contrast of target stimuli was set at GY's threshold for reports <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> (a feeling "that something happened" in his blind visual field). GY's accuracy was significantly greater than chance and comparable, with or without awareness. GY was significantly faster to respond correctly on valid-cue versus invalid-cue trials, even in the absence <b>of</b> <b>awareness,</b> confirming the action of visuo-spatial attention in the absence <b>of</b> <b>awareness.</b> Time-frequency analysis <b>of</b> spectral power in the gamma frequency range (30 - 90 Hz), averaged over left parieto-occipital sensors, revealed effects of cue-validity independent <b>of</b> reported <b>awareness,</b> and effects <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> independent <b>of</b> cue-validity. GY's reports <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> were not, however, independent of his pre-target attentional state (gamma-band response to the central cue), consistent with a one-way, but not a two-way, dissociation between attention {{and awareness}}. Our evidence suggests that the observed cue-validity effect is an awareness-independent involuntary re-orienting response, and that the neurodynamics underlying the exogenous capture of attention are similar with or without <b>awareness.</b> The finding <b>of</b> a significant awareness-independent effect in the area of 40 Hz implies that a stimulus-induced modulation of power in the canonical gamma band is not a sufficient condition for sensory awareness...|$|R

Moreover, the scheduling algorithm is implemented and verified by a prototype system, results from which indicate that awareness scheduling is useful for decreasing the loss <b>of</b> the <b>awareness</b> capability <b>of</b> system in a limited or unstable network. ...|$|R
