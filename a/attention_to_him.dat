[...] However, some critics noted that when bowling an occasional faster ball, Mold's action changed slightly; this was the delivery to which Phillips objected.

During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
