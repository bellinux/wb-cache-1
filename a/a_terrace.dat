5|$|The Masonic Hall in Taunton, Somerset, is {{designated}} by Historic England as a Grade II* listed building. It was originally {{built in the}} early 19th century as St George's Chapel, the first Roman Catholic chapel open for public worship in Taunton since the Reformation. The building, which forms the end of <b>a</b> <b>terrace,</b> features a series of prominent Ionic pilasters along the front and southern end.|$|E
5|$|On Berrow Road, {{near the}} High Lighthouse, numbers 4, 6 and 8 {{were part of}} <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> built between 1838 and 1841. Number 31 was {{previously}} a lodge. On the corner of Berrow Road and Sea View is a drinking fountain from 1897 with a single dressed stone pier and moulded plinth, topped by a cast iron urn. Each side has the lions head design with those on {{the north and south}} sides giving water into a Purbeck Marble bowl.|$|E
5|$|Patio F is on <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> at {{the same}} level as Patios D and E. The patio is a closed {{courtyard}} formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two sides are formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure {{on the south side of}} the patio. A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E

5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of <b>a</b> <b>terrace.</b> It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On {{the southern}} side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house faces an area of lawn and ornamental shrubbery. To the south east is a pathway to a pergola, in front of <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> garden, with a paved walkway through topiary. The walkway leads to a flower garden and beyond to a lawn surrounded by yew hedges with an apse at one end. At {{the other end of}} the pergola is a walkway flanked by lime trees.|$|E

5|$|The first {{traces of}} human {{activity}} at the site date to approximately 800 BC, with the first structures being built about 350 BC. Around 250 AD the complex underwent a major redevelopment {{with the construction of}} a massive basal platform that supported a cluster of temples; this was followed around AD 450 by the addition of a row of four pyramids on <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> to the south of the main platform.|$|E
5|$|The large {{triangular}} plaza on {{the west}} side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street. However, the steps were changed to <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> in the final design. The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street. The terrace is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench.|$|E
5|$|The tower has two outdoor {{terraces}} {{as part of}} Trump's {{agreement with}} the city during construction. There is <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> {{on the fifth floor}} on the northern (57th Street) side of the building, with a smaller fourth-floor terrace on the southern (56th Street) side. The fifth-floor north-side terrace has several trees and a fountain, while the fourth-floor south-side terrace has little more than a few granite benches. There is also a passageway to a glass-roofed POPS at 590 Madison Avenue.|$|E

5|$|All {{three of}} the stelae were {{discovered}} by Teoberto Maler in 1901 {{near one of the}} site's main temple, the O-13 pyramid. Stela 13 was possibly erected on <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 lies in a row on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway. Stela 23, on the other hand, was erected at the very base of the pyramid. This pyramid was most likely the burial place for Itzam K'an Ahk II, and—seeing as how Ha' K'in Xook, Yo'nal Ahk III, and K'inich Yat Ahk II all revered the site as a dynastic shrine—it is further evidence to back the argument that Ha' K'in Xook was the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of civic}} {{redevelopment}} {{of the market}} area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along {{either side of the}} memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's golf partner, John Blackwell, (a {{cousin to}} Blanche Blackwell) {{was also a}} cousin by {{marriage}} to Ernő Goldfinger and disliked him: it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name. Fleming also disliked what Goldfinger was doing destroying Victorian buildings, replacing them with the architect's modernist designs, particularly <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> at Goldfinger's own residence at 2 Willow Road. Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming {{over the use of}} the name and, in retaliation, Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger. Fleming's golfing friend John Blackwell then became the heroin smuggler {{at the beginning of the}} book, with a sister who was a heroin addict.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{east from}} the Water Gate, the {{south-eastern}} curtain defences and the south-east bastion were rebuilt {{at the start}} of the 20th century to hold emplacements for four quick-firing guns and two 6-inch (15 cm) guns, with underground tunnels linking to an underground magazine. Four artillery pieces, dating from 1898 to 1942, are on display. Facing the parade ground are the officers' quarters, <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> of houses probably dating in its current form to the late 18th century, with a stables at the northern end, originally used to hold the commandant's horses. It now holds the Bernard Truss collection of military memorabilia. The north-east bastion was redesigned after 1868 and contains an earth-covered magazine, as well as emplacements for 9-inch (22 cm) rifled muzzle loading guns.|$|E
5|$|The Goodison Park {{structure}} {{was built in}} stages. In the summer of 1895 a new Bullens Road stand was built and a roof placed on the original Goodison Road stand but only after five directors, including Chairman, George Mahon had resigned over what was described in the club minutes as 'acute administrative difficulties'. In 1906, the doubled-decker Goodison Avenue Stand was built behind the goal {{at the south end}} of the ground. The stand was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley who went on to chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later. The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of the stand and the poor sightlines meant that the goal line had to be moved seven metres north, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for the stand was near £13,000. There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with <b>a</b> <b>terrace</b> below.|$|E
