5|$|After the storyline {{feud with}} Big Show ended, Lashley entered a short program with Rob Van Dam, {{which led to}} Van Dam earning a title match on the January 2, 2007 episode of ECW. The match between the two ended in a No Contest <b>after</b> <b>Test</b> {{interfered}} during the bout. Test's interference led to a storyline with the champion, leading to a title match at the Royal Rumble, which Lashley won.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{four days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of the film, a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed <b>after</b> <b>test</b> screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films.|$|E

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships <b>after</b> <b>test</b> Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|When Sabu {{was found}} kayfabe {{unconscious}} {{in the locker}} room area before the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember, Holly was chosen as his replacement. Holly entered with Rob Van Dam as the first of two combatants. He was the second to be eliminated; he was eliminated by Test by a running big boot. Subsequently, he entered into a feud with CM Punk whereby Holly, now a tweener, showed his endurance by surviving Punk's Anaconda Vice submission hold. Holly then gave Punk his first loss in ECW; Punk had been undefeated for half a year. <b>After</b> <b>Test</b> replaced Holly in a match against ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley, Holly vowed he would become champion whether he faced Test or Lashley. Holly then was one of ECW superstars entered in the Royal Rumble, but was eliminated by The Great Khali. Holly soon became the number one contender for Lashley's ECW Championship and faced off against Lashley, albeit unsuccessfully.|$|E

In the end, Test attempted to hit Steiner with a chair but Keibler came inside the ring and took the chair. Keibler tried to hit Test but hit Steiner, allowing Test to execute a running big boot for the pin. Therefore, Steiner became Test's property, as per the pre-match stipulation.|$|E
25|$|Siemens-Shuckert {{delivered}} the R.IV to the German military on 29 January 1916, and {{trouble with the}} engines began almost immediately. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>test</b> flights commenced, {{it was necessary to}} replace the original HS engines with new ones. While the engines were being replaced, a number of other modifications were carried out, including replacing the original nose-mounted radiators with aerofoil-shaped radiators fitted in the upper wing and adding new gravity-fed fuel tanks. With these improvements in place, the R.IV flew again in May 1916. Even then, the engines overheated until one of the cylinders turned blue.|$|E

25|$|To {{test the}} new 1,100PS (1,085hp, 809kW) DB 601A engine, two more prototypes (V14 and V15) were built, each differing in their armament. While the V14 was armed with two 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17s above {{the engine and}} one 20mm MG FF in each wing, the V15 was just fitted with the two MG 17s mounted above the engine. <b>After</b> <b>test</b> fights, the V14 was {{considered}} more promising and a pre-production batch of 10 E-0 was ordered. Batches of both E-1 and E-3 variants were shipped to Spain for evaluation, and first saw combat during the final phases of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} {{constructed}} the language, {{and what it was}} based on. Gary Kurtz stated that the Skeksis language was conceived by author Alan Garner, who based it on Ancient Egyptian, while Odell stated it was he who created it, and that it was formed from Indo-European roots. This idea was dropped <b>after</b> <b>test</b> screening audiences found the captions too distracting, but the original effect can be observed in selected scenes on the various DVD releases. The language of the Podlings was based on Serbo-Croatian, with Kurtz noting that audience members fluent in Polish, Russian and other Slavic languages could understand individual words, but not whole sentences.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>test</b> {{observations}} by Paul Guthnick in {{the summer}} of 1906 a new site was found on a hill {{in the eastern part of}} the Royal Park of Babelsberg. The ground was placed at the observatory's disposal by the crown free of charge. The costs of the new buildings and the new instruments amounted to 1.5 million Goldmark and could be covered by selling the landed property of the Berlin Observatory. The old observatory built by Schinkel was pulled down later. In June 1911 the construction of a new observatory began in Babelsberg and on 2 August 1913 the removal from Berlin to Babelsberg was complete.|$|E

25|$|Repair {{works were}} {{estimated}} at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the reinforcing steel mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. <b>After</b> <b>test</b> running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E

He made his Test debut on 7 April against the West Indies at Barbados, and scored his maiden Test century (106) in the third Test in Roseau. Wade was then selected ahead of Haddin for Australia's following Test series against South Africa in November 2012, and held his place {{until the end of the}} 2012–13 season, encompassing a home series against Sri Lanka, and a tour of India.

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>test</b> screenings, it {{was decided}} to re-shoot Captain Kirk's death. Originally, Kirk was shot and killed by Doctor Soran, but it was felt by the test {{audience}} {{that this was not a}} fitting death for such an iconic character. The re-shoot changed the manner of his death, so that instead, he sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.|$|E
25|$|Car part {{production}} at the plant ended on December 12, 1941, and one month later the factory became a unit of Eastern Aircraft, one of five former General Motors plants in the area which was shifted {{to the war effort}} and used to construct the TBM variants of the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber for the United States Navy during World War II. Subassemblies from other factories were shipped to Ewing Township via the Reading Railroad and were combined with other components built at Ewing, with the completed planes brought to Skillman Airport (later known as Trenton-Mercer Airport) for delivery to the military <b>after</b> <b>test</b> flights were completed. The first Avenger built at the plant was test flown in November 1942, less than eight months after the facility had started being converted to military purposes. A total of 7,800 Avengers were constructed at the plant in Ewing, including the plane George H. W. Bush was flying on September 2, 1944, when he was shot down over the Pacific Ocean by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. In September 1945, the Navy turned almost all of the plants it had acquired during the war over to the Surplus Property Administration; portions of the Ewing plant were one of the limited number of exceptions. After the war ended, the plant was converted to return to production of auto components.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, Steiner faced {{off against}} Nowinski {{in a debate}} over the Iraq War. Later that year, Steiner formed a tag team with Test, with Stacy Keibler as their manager. The team lasted several months, and feuded with La Résistance. They broke up <b>after</b> <b>Test</b> turned heel and began misogynistically {{treating}} Keibler. On June 15, Steiner defeated Test in a grudge match to win the managerial services of Keibler at Bad Blood, but lost her back to Test in a rematch on the August 18 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven on September 21, Steiner faced Test with Keibler's managerial services again {{on the line with}} the extra stipulation that, if Steiner lost, he would become Test's manservant. Steiner lost after Keibler's interference backfired, and the tag team was reunited at Test's behest. After another mistake by Keibler cost the team a match on the September 29 episode of Raw, a frustrated Steiner belly to belly suplexed her, resulting in Steiner turning heel and teaming on better terms with Test as Keibler was forced to remain their reluctant manager. On December 1, Mick Foley fired in storyline Steiner and Test freeing Stacy as their manager. His last WWE match was {{as a part of the}} 2004 Royal Rumble, lasting over 6 minutes before being eliminated by Booker T. Steiner suffered an injury in 2004, sidelining him for two months. While injured, he was released from WWE on August 17.|$|E
