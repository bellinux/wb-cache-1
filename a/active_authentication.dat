This may allow an attacker to clone passport chips that use the optional <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> anti-cloning mechanism on chips - if the chip design is susceptible to this attack. In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that optional security mechanisms can be disabled by removing their presence from the passport index file. This allows an attacker to remove - amongst others - anti-cloning mechanisms (<b>Active</b> <b>Authentication).</b> The attack is documented in supplement 7 of Doc 9303 (R1-p1_v2_sIV_0006) and can be solved by patching inspection system software. Note that supplement 7 features vulnerable examples in the same document that - when implemented - result in a vulnerable inspection process.|$|E

5000|$|Passive Authentication (PA). In 2006 Lukas Grunwald {{demonstrated}} {{that it is}} trivial to copy passport data from a passport chip into a standard ISO/IEC 14443 smartcard using a standard contactless card interface and a simple file transfer tool. Grunwald used a passport that did not use <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> (anti-cloning) and did not change the data held on the copied chip, thus keeping its cryptographic signature valid. In 2008 Jeroen van Beek {{demonstrated that}} not all passport inspection systems check the cryptographic signature of a passport chip. For his demonstration Van Beek altered chip information and signed it using his own document signing key of a non-existing country. This can only be detected by checking the country signing keys {{that are used to}} sign the document signing keys. To check country signing keys the ICAO PKD can be used. Only 5 out of 60+ countries are using this central database. Van Beek did not update the original passport chip: instead an ePassport emulator was used. Also in 2008, The Hacker's Choice implemented all attacks and published code to verify the results. The release included a video clip that demonstrated problems by using a forged Elvis Presley passport that is recognized as a valid US passport.|$|E

These systems are responsible for supervising everything from natural gas valves to electric substations. For the past half century, SCADA and ICS networks have been proprietary, closed systems, entirely contained within a private network. Their security was derived from air gap networking, physically isolating these systems from the Internet. However, system operators are increasingly opting to connect their control systems to Internet or corporate intranet networks in order to substantially reduce operating costs and improve reporting capabilities.

We provide a probabilistic framework for dynamically selecting an <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme that satisfies a specified security requirement given passive factors. We also present the results of three user studies evaluating the feasibility and users’ receptiveness of our concept.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss an {{efficient}} {{combination of the}} cryptographic protocols adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for securing the communication of machine readable travel documents and readers. Roughly, in the original protocol the parties first run the Password-Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) protocol to establish a shared key and then the reader (optionally) invokes the <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> (AA) protocol to verify the passport’s validity. Here we show that by carefully re-using some of the secret data of the PACE protocol for the AA protocol one can save one exponentiation on the passports’s side. We call this the PACE|AA protocol. We then formally prove that this more efficient combination not only preserves the desirable security properties of the two individual protocols but also increases privacy by preventing misuse of the challenge in the <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> protocol. We finally discuss a solution which allows deniable authentication {{in the sense that}} the interaction cannot be used as a proof towards third parties. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{solution}} to the problem of <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> using trace histories is addressed. Specifically, the task is to perform user verification on mobile devices using historical location traces of the user as a function of time. Considering the movement of a human as a Markovian motion, a modified Hidden Markov Model (HMM) -based solution is proposed. The proposed method, namely the Marginally Smoothed HMM (MSHMM), utilizes the marginal probabilities of location and timing information of the observations to smooth-out the emission probabilities while training. Hence, it can efficiently handle unforeseen observations during the test phase. The verification performance of this method is compared to a sequence matching (SM) method, a Markov Chain-based method (MC) and an HMM with basic Laplace Smoothing (HMM-lap). Experimental results using the location information of the UMD <b>Active</b> <b>Authentication</b> Dataset- 02 (UMDAA 02) and the GeoLife dataset are presented.

30|$|In general, {{cryptographic}} methods {{are applied to}} protect the security of digital data by using encryption keys. Without the correct key, illegal attackers cannot acquire the original data. However, encryption and decryption procedures are time-consuming processes, and they are thus not suitable for high-volume multimedia data [7], digital images, and videos. Image authentication [7, 8] {{is one of the}} techniques for protecting the content integrity of digital images from malicious and unauthorized modification. Image authentication technology can detect and indicate any changes or tampered regions in a tampered image. Image authentication schemes are classified into two categories: <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> [8 – 18] and passive authentication [19 – 21] schemes. The <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme involves extracting particular features of the image beforehand and then concealing them within the image itself, whereas the passive authentication scheme entails authenticating images with no prior information requirement. The active image authentication approach is also called fragile watermarking [12], which involves hiding a watermark in an image. The hidden watermark is highly sensitive to any modifications in the image such that it becomes fragile and even unrecognizable when the image is modified. Hence, specific locations that have been illegally modified can easily be indicated using these broken areas.|$|E

In this study, we collect and analyze behavioral biometrics data from 200 subjects, each using their personal Android mobile device for a period of at least 30 days. This dataset is novel in the context of <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> due to its size, duration, number of modalities, and absence of restrictions on tracked activity. The geographical colocation of the subjects in the study is representative of a large closed-world environment such as an organization where the unauthorized user of a device is likely to be an insider threat: coming from within the organization. We consider four biometric modalities: (1) text entered via soft keyboard, (2) applications used, (3) websites visited, and (4) physical location of the device as determined from GPS (when outdoors) or WiFi (when indoors). We implement and test a classifier for each modality and organize the classifiers as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture. We are able to characterize the performance of the system with respect to intruder detection time and to quantify the contribution of each modality to the overall performance.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a new concept}} of biometric-based cybersecurity systems for <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> by continuous tracking, which utilizes biochemical processing of metabolites present in skin secretions. Skin secretions contain {{a large number of}} metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable <b>active</b> <b>authentication</b> at the level of an individual.
