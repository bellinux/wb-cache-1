40|$|AbstractFluvoxamine (FLU), a {{non-toxic}} compound {{was investigated}} {{as an alternative}} <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>additive</b> for inhibition of J 55 steel corrosion in acidic oil well treatment fluids. The aggressive fluid was simulated using 15 % and 1 M HCl. Corrosion of the steel was monitored by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Potentiodynamic Polarization (PDP), Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR), Electrochemical Frequency Modulation (EFM) and Weight Loss (WL) techniques. UV–Vis spectroscopy provided evidence of formation of a complex surface film due to adsorption of FLU on the J 55 steel surface. The adsorption process was both physical and chemical in mechanism as best approximated by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorption was also spontaneous and exothermic {{in the direction of}} increase in entropy of the bulk phase. Maximum inhibition efficiency was obtained with 1. 0 μM FLU and decreased from 91. 5 % to 78. 0 % when concentration of HCl was increased from 1 M to 15 % at 30 °C. Effectiveness of FLU declined with an increase in temperature and improved with an increase in concentration of FLU. Blending of FLU with some intensifiers improved the efficiency from 68 % and 40 % to 88 % and 72 % in 1 M and 15 % HCl respectively at 90 °C. EIS measurement reveals that the corrosion process was controlled by charge transfer process. PDP measurements showed that FLU acts as a mixed type inhibitor. Inhibition efficiency values obtained from the different techniques were comparable. SEM micrographs of J 55 steel surface indicate good surface protection of FLU. Theoretical calculations were performed using Material Studio Acceryls 7. 0 to relate electronic properties of FLU with its structure...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for {{improvements}} in the environmental credentials of the organic coatings industry, several different aspects are currently being addressed, including the reduction of volatile organic compounds, development of UV curable coatings and the reduction of potentially hazardous components in the coatings formulations. The aim of this work was to develop the water based primers for coil coating applications as a substitution for chromate conversion coatings. The performance and durability of three novel water based systems applied on alkali cleaned HDGS has been investigated; XPS and ToF-SIMS have been employed to analyse the failure interfaces generated by various test methods designed to assess the performance and durability {{of each of the}} systems. In depth analysis has been carried out using ULAM for sample preparation, and XPS and ToF-SIMS were employed to analyse the buried metal/ primer interface, in order to investigate the interface chemistry. A method of post processing data, obtained by surface analysis techniques, was invented to gain a clear understanding of the possible chemical interactions occurred at the metal/primer interface. Adsorption studies were also carried out to encode the interfacial chemistry. The method was used to understand the role of adhesion promoter in the primer formulation, particularly {{the manner in which it}} interacts with the substrate and the topcoat and the way it improves the performance and durability; also to determine the role of <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>additives,</b> especially the manner in which it prevents the corrosion and therefore its contribution toward the performance and durability. The distribution of these components across the primer layer was also investigated considering the possible opportunities of such components enhancing the primer interaction at either interfaces. The finding has been used for re-adjustment of some of process parameters in coil coating systems and specifically water based primers...|$|R
40|$|Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) {{are useful}} for the food {{industry}} as viscosifying, stabilising, emulsifying, and gelling agents. The improvement of texture in fermented dairy products by generally recognised as safe (GRAS) lactic acid bacteria, is caused {{in part by the}} in situ production of EPSs. Most studied are heteropolysaccharides (HePSs) produced by LAB, and many studies have been performed into their structure-function relationships. Many parts of the biosynthesis of these EPSs have been elucidated in recent years. In case of homopolysaccharides (HoPSs) only initial structural studies have been performed. The research described in this thesis was part of the EET (Economy, Ecology, Technology) programme "Bioprimer" (EETK 01129), researching LAB α-D-glucan EPSs as <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>additives</b> for use in heavy-duty coatings. The aim {{of the study was to}} perform complete structural characterisations of α-D-glucans, produced by glucansucrase (GTF) enzymes from Lactobacilli. Some α-D-glucans have been indicated as promising anti-corrosives, whereas others showed no anti-corrosive activity in a pilot study. To understand the mechanism of anti-corrosive activity, detailed structural knowledge of these glucans is required. In order to perform the challenging analysis of α-D-glucans, an NMR structural-reporter-group concept was established (Chapter 2), based on known di- and trisaccharide standards. Making use of the structural-reporter-group concept, the primary structure of EPSs produced in vitro by the glucansucrase (GTF 180) enzyme from Lb. reuteri strain 180 (Chapter 3; EPS 180) and the glucansucrase (GTFA) enzyme from Lb. reuteri strain 35 - 5 (Chapter 4; EPS 35 - 5), using sucrose as a substrate, were analysed. Based on all data gathered visual presentations, that include all identified structural features, were formulated. During the analysis of each EPS, new structural-reporter-group signals were added to the concept. Using the enhanced structural-reporter-group concept the EPS product produced from sucrose by a triple mutant of the glucansucrase (GTF 180;V 1027 P:S 1137 N:A 1139 S) enzyme from Lb. reuteri strain 180 (mEPS-PNNS) was analysed (Chapter 5). Again a picture was formulated, that includes all structural elements indentified, and the structural-reporter-group concept was complemented. In Chapter 6, structural characterisations were performed on α-D-glucans produced from sucrose by 12 mutant glucansucrase GTF 180 enzymes of Lb. reuteri strain 180. Mutations were selected based on sequences observed in other glucansucrase enzymes, i. e. reuteransucrase (NNS), mutansucrase (NNV), alternansucrase (YDA), and dextransucrase (SEV) enzymes, as well as single mutant variants of these sequences. Making use of the structural-reporter-group concept the 1 H NMR spectroscopic data were interpreted, and combined with methylation analysis data to formulate visual representations, depicting all structural elements identified for the 12 mutant EPSs...|$|R
