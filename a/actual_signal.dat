40|$|The {{following}} robust detection {{problem is}} considered in this note. The nominal signals are known, but the <b>actual</b> <b>signals</b> {{present in the}} observed data can be corrupted slightly. The probability distribution of the noise is known precisely, or some small deviation exists from the nominal model. To derive the robust detector which is insensitive to the corruption of signals and deviation from nominal noise model, we apply the approach in robust hypothesis testing: find the worst-case signals or signal-noise combination with constrains on the signal corruption and noise modeling deviation. April 26, 1996 1 Introduction In this note we consider the following detection problem. The nominal signals are known, but the <b>actual</b> <b>signals</b> present in the observed data can be corrupted slightly. This situation may arise because of imperfect prepagation characteristic,element position uncertainties, or element gain variation [10, 11].

5000|$|Approximately 65% of the neurons in the pre-motor cortex are {{responsible}} for conditional [...] "closed-loop" [...] motor tasks. In experimentation using monkeys, when they were trained to reach in different directions, depending on the specified visual cue, the approximately coordinated lateral pre-motor neurons began to fire at the appearance of that specified cue, but before the <b>actual</b> <b>signal</b> to perform the movement. As learning takes place, to associate a new visual cue with a particular movement, the approximately coordinated neurons increase their rate of fire during the time between the initial specified cue and the <b>actual</b> <b>signal</b> for the initiation of the movement. It now seems that these specific neurons do not command the initiation of the movements but the intention to perform the movements. Thus these pre-motor neurons are especially involved {{in the selection of}} movements based on external events.|$|E

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows: In Section 2, we recall basic facts and definitions on copulas and the dependency problem. Section 3 includes the main signal and noise model {{used in the}} paper. The introduced models are such comprehensive ones which precisely correspond to <b>actual</b> <b>signals.</b> Using copula, the PDF of the received signal is estimated in Section 4, and the fading parameter is determined. Finally, simulation results are given in Section 5, and some conclusions are drawn in Section 6.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{knowledge}} {{is also used}} when facing noise. In sensory neurons that receive redundant and structured signals, sensory processing can differentiate the signal from noise.

Furthermore, a novel PC scheme with notably low-hardware complexity and improved error vector magnitude (EVM) performance is proposed with its effectiveness experimentally demonstrated.|$|R
