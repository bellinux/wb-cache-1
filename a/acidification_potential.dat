The inclusion of fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity results in a different ranking of substances compared to simpler model outcomes. In the context of acidification, emissions of nitrogen compounds are regarded as about a factor 2 less important relative to sulfur compounds. Furthermore, using RAINS-LCA as opposed to simpler models, it was found that region-specific differences in terrestrial eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials</b> range up to 1. 5 and 3. 5 orders of magnitude, respectively.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of life cycle {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from power generation with {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is a critical factor in energy and policy analysis. The current paper examines life cycle emissions from three types of fossil-fuel-based power plants, namely supercritical pulverized coal (super-PC), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), with and without CCS. Results show that, for a 90 % CO 2 capture efficiency, life cycle GHG emissions are reduced by 75 - 84 % depending on what technology is used. With GHG emissions less than 170 g/kWh, IGCC technology is found to be favorable to NGCC with CCS. Sensitivity analysis reveals that, for coal power plants, varying the CO 2 capture efficiency and the coal transport distance has a more pronounced effect on life cycle GHG emissions than changing the length of CO 2 transport pipeline. Finally, it is concluded from the current study that while the global warming potential is reduced when MEA-based CO 2 capture is employed, the increase in other air pollutants such as NOx and NH 3 leads to higher eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R

In experiments with multiple unresolved factors and a sub-optimal number of replicates, post-processing statistical inference tools might fail to detect an effect that is present. We propose that in such cases, data-based model analyses might be suitable tools to unearth potential responses to the treatment and identify the uncertainties that could produce the observed variability. As test cases, we used data from two independent mesocosm experiments. Both experiments showed high standard deviations and, according to statistical inference tools, biomass appeared insensitive to changing CO 2 conditions. Conversely, our simulations showed earlier and more intense phytoplankton blooms in modeled replicates at high CO 2 concentrations and suggested that uncertainties in average cell size, phytoplankton biomass losses, and initial nutrient concentration potentially outweigh acidification effects by triggering strong variability during the bloom phase. We also estimated the thresholds below which uncertainties do not escalate to high variability.

40|$|Latvian’s {{energy supply}} {{is based on}} a {{balanced}} mixture of energy sources, in which renewable sources are represented with circa 30 % in the final energy consumption for the year 2007. The EU directive fixes the target of 40 % share of renewable energy resources in the final consumption in 2020. Latvia takes an active part in research on the climate change issues and the country has undertaken EU and Kyoto obligations for CO 2 emission reduction and increase of share of the renewable energy sources in energy supply mix. Dependence on imported energy sources, growth of electricity prices, the need for support to local producers are the main reasons for use of new renewable energy technologies in the Latvian energy sector. In this context hydrogen is perceived {{as one of the most}} promising options for energy storage and transport in the future. If hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources, it can help to solve energy related problems such as climate change, air pollution, and energy security. One regenerative path to produce hydrogen is the photobiological hydrogen production by the green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This innovative technology for the biological and renewable production of hydrogen could play an important part in the future in Latvian energy sector for a transition to an hydrogen economy, minimizing emission with significance in regional and global levels and in order to be implemented in the market of the white credit. Nowdays the outcomes of biohydrogen from photosynthesis processes are still small, however different development methods and laboratory studies are carried out to increase the yield and meanwhile addressing the influence to the environment and climate change. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one approach that enables the energy requirements, GHG balance and other environmental impacts of bioenergy production chains to be accounted and accurately compared. Hence LCA is good tool in order to give the possibility to compare different biohydrogen production approaches. The intention of this paper is to compare different LCAs on the photobiological hydrogen production to evaluate potentials and prospects and to rank the process with other regenerative hydrogen production technologies.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the environmental impact of organic and conventional small-scale dairy farms in mountain areas. Sixteen farms rearing the dual-purpose Rendena breed were assessed for global warming <b>potential,</b> <b>acidification</b> and eutrophication impacts through the Life Cycle Assessment method in two scenarios: the Baseline Scenario based on the actual farm data and the Milk-Beef production system Scenario assuming that calves exceeding the culling rate were fattened directly on-farm. Three different emissions allocation methods were considered: No allocation; Physical allocation, which also accounted for the co-product beef; and Economic allocation, which also accounted for the ecosystem services provided by the farms and were estimated on the basis of agri-environmental payments. Furthermore, two functional units were used: fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and utilizable agricultural land (UAL). Within the Baseline Scenario and with FPCM as the functional unit, performing No allocation, the mean values obtained for the global warming <b>potential,</b> <b>acidification</b> and eutrophication were 1. 43 kg CO 2 -eq/kg FPCM, 25. 84 g SO 2 -eq/kg FPCM and 3. 99 g PO 43 - - eq/kg FPCM, respectively. The organic farms had a significantly lower eutrophication impact than the conventional farms considering all three allocation methods. Conversely, if UAL was used as the functional unit, the mean values obtained for the global warming <b>potential,</b> <b>acidification</b> and eutrophication were 0. 80 kg CO 2 -eq/m(2), 14. 28 g SO 2 -eq/m(2) and 2. 32 g PO 43 - eq/m(2), respectively. The Milk-Beef production system Scenario increased emissions per m(2) of UAL, but it reduced the emissions apportioned to 1 kg of FPCM, with stronger trends in the organic farms because of the increased added value of the meat production. This study highlights how strengthening beef production in dual-purpose breeds reduced the emissions apportioned to milk and suggests an approach to acknowledge multi-functionality considering some of the ecosystem services provided by the farms.

A low {{environmental impact of}} milk production is not necessarily associated with an economically viable farm. To gain insight into a possible “trade-off” between economic and environmental sustainability, {{the relation between the}} environmental and economic indicators of dairy farms was quantified, and farm characteristics that influence this relation were identified. Economic and environmental indicators were quantified for 119 specialized dairy farms in 2005, based on data from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Economic indicators used were: gross value added expressed per kg fat-and-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) or expressed per unit of labour, i. e. labour productivity. Environmental indicators used were: land use per kg FPCM, energy use per kg FPCM, global warming potential per kg FPCM, eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per kg FPCM or per ha of land. Environmental indicators were deduced from a life cycle assessment. High labour productivity on dairy farms was associated with low on-farm energy use, total and on-farm land use, total and on-farm global warming potential, and total and off-farm <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per kg FPCM. High labour productivity, however, was associated also with high on-farm eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per hectare. From partial least squares regression analysis, it was concluded that relations between economic and environmental indicators were affected mainly by milk production per ha, annual milk production per cow, farm size, and amount of concentrates per kg FPCM. An increase in annual milk production per cow, for example, not only increased labour productivity, reduced energy use and global warming potential per kg FPCM but also, {{in the case of an}} unchanged stocking density, increased eutrophication and acidification per ha.

40|$|This {{environmental}} assessment of alternative means for managing food waste {{is based on}} the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. It covers the service provided by a household in-sink food waste processor (FWP) unit, and alternatives to it. The three alternatives considered are home composting, landfilling food waste with municipal waste (‘‘codisposal’’) and centralised composting of green (food and garden) waste. The functional unit is defined as management of the food waste produced by a Sydney household in one year. The {{environmental assessment}} includes eight environmental indicators and impact categories. This LCA study identifies an environmentally preferable option as well as the key environmental issues. If operated aerobically, home composting has the least environmental impact in all impact categories. The environmental performance of the codisposal option is relatively good, except with respect to climate change and eutrophication potential. The FWP performed well in terms of energy usage, climate change and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials,</b> although it makes a large contribution to eutrophication and toxicity potentials. Demonstration of the relatively high water consumption of the FWP is an important outcome of this LCA study, as Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth. Compared with the other three options, centralised composting has a relatively poor environmental performance due to the energy-intense waste collection activities it requires. Implementing a separate collection and transportation system for organic waste results in relatively high environmental impacts due to the frequency of collections and the small quantities of green waste collected per household. Compared with European cities, significantly larger distances have to be travelled in Sydney, differentiating this LCA from previous work. Non-recurrent impacts of the FWP are identified as causing large contributions to the overall result for this waste management option due to the types of materials used and the low operational capacities of the FWP. Finally, although home composting is clearly the best option in terms of the categories examined in this LCA, there is an important caveat to this result. If operated without due care, home composting loses its allure due to the high greenhouse gas emissions consequent to anaerobic methanogenesis. Although home composting has the capacity to be the best food waste management option, it can also perform worst in relation to a subject in which Australia is already at the bottom of its class...|$|R

Under EU Renewable energy targets, Ireland must achieve contributions of 40 %, 12 % and 10 % from renewables to electricity, heat and transport respectively by 2020, {{in addition to a}} 20 % reduction in GHG emissions. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to carry out a comprehensive, holistic evaluation of biomass-to-energy systems in 2020 based on indigenous biomass supply chains optimised to reduce production and transportation GHG emissions. Impact categories assessed include; global warming, <b>acidification,</b> eutrophication <b>potentials,</b> and energy demand. Two biomass energy conversion technologies are considered; co-firing with peat, and biomass CHP (combined heat and power) systems. Biomass is allocated to each plant according to a supply optimisation model which ensures minimal GHG emissions. The study shows that while CHP systems produce lower environmental impacts than co-firing systems in isolation, determining overall environmental impacts requires analysis of the reference energy systems which are displaced. In addition, if the aims of these systems are to increase renewable energy penetration in line with the renewable electricity and renewable heat targets, the optimal scenario may not be the one which achieves the greatest environmental impact reductions...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of the aragonitic CaCO 3 otoliths of teleost fish could be vulnerable to processes resulting from ocean <b>acidification.</b> The <b>potential</b> effects of an increase in atmospheric CO 2 on the calcification of the otoliths were investigated by rearing Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. larvae in 3 pCO 2 concentrations-control (370 µatm), medium (1800 µatm) and high (4200 µatm) -from March to May 2010. Increased otolith growth was observed in 7 to 46 d post hatch (dph) cod larvae at elevated pCO 2 concentrations. The sagittae and lapilli were usually largest in the high pCO 2 treatment followed by the medium and control treatments. The greatest difference in mean otolith surface area (normalized to fish length) was for sagittae at 11 dph, with medium and high treatments being 46 and 43 % larger than the control group, respectively. There was no significant pCO 2 effect on the shape of the otoliths nor were there any trends in the fluctuating asymmetry, defined as the difference between the right and left sides, in relation to the increase in otolith growth from elevated pCO 2...|$|R
30|$|In the present, {{paper we}} {{investigated}} an {{impact of the}} membrane permeable iron chelator deferoxamine and membrane permeable zinc chelator N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2 -pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) on free radical formation in rat brain synaptosomes at low pHo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was monitored by the fluorescent dye DCFDA and dihydroethidium (LeBel and Bondy 1990; Pekun et al. 2013). It {{is well known that}} depolarization of mitochondrial membrane can cause free radical formation (Votyakova and Reynolds 2001; Abramov et al. 2007; Manzanero et al. 2013; Pekun et al. 2013) and a subsequent ROS accumulation is able to result in depolarization of the neuronal plasma membrane (Bao et al. 2005; Nani et al. 2010). <b>Acidification</b> decreases <b>potentials</b> in either mitochondrial or plasma membrane of rat brain synaptosomes (Fedorovich et al. 1996, 2003; Pekun et al. 2013, 2014); therefore, we investigated the effects of chelators on mitochondrial or plasma membrane potentials. Plasma membrane potential was monitored by a fluorescent dye DiSC 3 (5) (Waseem and Fedorovich 2010), mitochondrial potential was monitored by a fluorescent dye JC- 1 (Chinopoulos et al. 1999). Further, we investigated the intrasynaptosomal concentration of reduced glutathione after lowering of pHo. Glutathione was monitored by a fluorescent dye monochlorobimane (Kamencic et al. 2000; Abramov et al. 2007).|$|R
