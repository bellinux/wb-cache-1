5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source.

5|$|Around 1786, Marshall gained public {{attention}} by expressing his suspicions about James Wilkinson's negotiations with Spain for free {{use of the}} Mississippi River <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky's secession from the United States to affiliate with Spanish possessions. For {{the remainder of his}} life, he vigorously opposed Wilkinson and anyone else he suspected of being involved with the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units.

This cinematological trend reflected {{much of the}} cynicism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> nuclear annihilation of the era.

5|$|The team {{wanted the}} theme of the game to {{resonate}} with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams.

Although the framework of the story was completed prior to Studio Ghibli's involvement with the game, they still took part in many discussions regarding some ideas, including the game's final scenes.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost no}} land left to develop for housing, Teaneck's {{population}} {{is likely to}} remain stable for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth.

5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> more.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with {{renewable sources of energy}} including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E

5|$|Operation Iskra was a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} Soviet forces. From a military perspective, the operation eliminated {{the possibility of the}} capture of the city and a German–Finnish link up, as the Leningrad Front was now very well supplied, reinforced and able to co-operate more closely with the Volkhov Front. For the civilian population, the operation meant that more food was able to reach the city, as well as improved conditions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> evacuating more civilians from the city. Breaking the blockade also had a significant strategic effect, although it was overshadowed by the surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad only a few days later. Notably, the first Tiger tank captured by the Soviets was taken during this battle. It was undamaged and evacuated by the Soviet forces for evaluation.|$|E

Out of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and Our Native overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
