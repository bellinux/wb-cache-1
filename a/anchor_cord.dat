50|$|The Spanish Navy uses more emblems than {{coats of}} arms used by units, flotillas, Navy Marines, Naval Action Forces, Maritime Action Forces, centres, organisms and Fleet and Navy General Headquarters. The most {{habitual}} elements are <b>anchors,</b> <b>cords,</b> ships constructed at different dates and the Spanish royal crown.|$|R
50|$|The CordA stone <b>cord</b> <b>anchoring</b> and {{connecting}} Voya Nui with Mahri Nui. It {{was here that}} the Toa Inika battled a swarm of Zyglak and Makuta Teridax. It was destroyed by the Toa Mahri, forcing Voya Nui to drop back into {{the gap in the}} Southern Continent.|$|R
50|$|British {{traveling}} forges likely had canvas covers {{as indicated}} by the number and spacing of wood arches above the bellows, and what appears to be <b>cord</b> <b>anchor</b> points {{on the sides of the}} bellows house. A canvas cover would have been logical as protection of the bellows from the weather, and in accordance with the standard practice of covering wagons at that time. This canvas cover evolved into the wooden cover of the U.S. version of the traveling forge.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the line}} cord and handset cord were secured by {{screw-down}} terminals at both ends, with a strain relief <b>anchor.</b> Both <b>cords</b> had matching colors, but most color sets initially were produced with neutral, dark gray cords, with {{exception of the}} ivory and brown sets. Starting in 1955, all sets, except dark blue were equipped with color-matched cords as dyes and manufacturing methods became stable. By 1973, line cords were changed to a neutral gray color and from a round to a flat cross-section. As a customer option, telephone sets could be ordered for portability with four-prong plugs, but most sets were hard-wired to wall connection boxes. In the 1970s, much smaller modular connectors were introduced for {{both ends of the}} line cord as well as the handset cord to facilitate standard connection methods for third-party equipment within the FCC registration system.|$|R
5000|$|Corded window blinds {{present a}} {{strangulation}} hazard to children, causing 184 {{deaths in the}} United States between 1996 and 2012. Recalls of window covering products have not significantly {{reduced the number of}} deaths since 1980. Retrofit kits have been used since 1995 to [...] "reduce" [...] the strangulation hazard; however, children have strangled on retrofit kits since 1995. The US CPSC recommends using cordless or cord-free window coverings where children live or visit. For window coverings that use continuous-loop cord systems, like vertical blinds, a wall cord cleat can be used to <b>anchor</b> the <b>cord</b> tightly to the wall and prevent children from having access to the dangling cord loop. Window blinds slats are held together with cords that allow for tilting slats, raising or lowering, and these are potentially dangerous if loose. As an added precaution, cord stops should be installed correctly and adjusted to restrict the movement of inner lift cords.|$|R
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} proper terminates {{in a region}} called the conus medullaris, while the pia mater {{continues}} as an extension called the filum terminale, which <b>anchors</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> to the coccyx. The cauda equina ("horse's tail") {{is a collection of}} nerves inferior to the conus medullaris that continue to travel through the vertebral column to the coccyx. The cauda equina forms because the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in sacral spinal nerves originating in the upper lumbar region.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how small amounts of mulch or plant residue effectively reduce erosion and runoff. The specific objectives were to evaluate the effects on runoff and erosion of (1) resistance to surface flow by known lineal lengths and uniform diameters of material (jute <b>cord</b> <b>anchored</b> with asphalt emulsion) adhered to the soil surface across the slope at uniform intervals to provide maximum resistance, (2) resistance to rill formation, without additional initial resistance to surface flow or raindrop impact, by treating narrow uniform strips of soil at uniform intervals across the slope with an asphalt emulsion, and (3) nearly eliminating raindrop impact energy by suspending a muslin mulch on a screen within a few inches of the soil surface. Small field plots and simulated rainfall were used in making the treatment comparisons. Advisor: Howard D. Wittmus...|$|R
500|$|In the {{original}} 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens. The stage machinery and the lighting effects {{were designed by}} Carl Brandt, who was the foremost stage technician of the time. One innovation which Cosima did eventually approve was {{the replacement of the}} wheeled stands with giant, invisible [...] "fishing rods" [...] on which the Rhinemaidens were dangled. Wires continued {{to be used in the}} Bayreuth productions of Siegfried Wagner and, later, those of his widow Winifred, who ran the Bayreuth Festival until the end of the Second World War. Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of Chicago Ring cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on bungee <b>cords</b> <b>anchored</b> in the fly space above the stage, enabling them to dive up and down, as intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.|$|R
50|$|In {{the upper}} part of the {{vertebral}} column, spinal nerves exit directly from the spinal cord, whereas in the lower part of the vertebral column nerves pass further down the column before exiting. The terminal portion of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The pia mater continues as an extension called the filum terminale, which <b>anchors</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> to the coccyx. The cauda equina (“horse’s tail”) is the name for the collection of nerves in the vertebral column that continue to travel through the vertebral column below the conus medullaris. The cauda equina forms as a result of the fact that the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in the fact that sacral spinal nerves actually originate in the upper lumbar region. The spinal cord can be anatomically divided into 31 spinal segments based on the origins of the spinal nerves.|$|R

50|$|The spinal {{pia mater}} closely follows and {{encloses}} {{the curves of}} the spinal cord, and is attached to it through {{a connection to the}} anterior fissure. The pia mater attaches to the dura mater through 21 pairs of denticulate ligaments that pass through the arachnoid mater and dura mater of the spinal cord. These denticular ligaments help to <b>anchor</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> and prevent side to side movement, providing stability. The membrane in this area is much thicker than the cranial pia mater, due to the two-layer composition of the pia membrane. The outer layer, which is made up of mostly connective tissue, is responsible for this thickness. Between the two layers are spaces which exchange information with the subarachnoid cavity as well as blood vessels. At the point where the pia mater reaches the conus medullaris or medullary cone {{at the end of the}} spinal cord, the membrane extends as a thin filament called the filum terminale or terminal filum, contained within the lumbar cistern. This filament eventually blends with the dura mater and extends as far as the coccyx, or tailbone. It then fuses with the periosteum, a membrane found at the surface of all bones, and forms the coccygeal ligament. There it is called the central ligament and assists with movements of the trunk of the body.|$|R
