5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> of (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of the goods yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E
5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b> Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E

50|$|The terms trickle filter, {{trickling}} biofilter, biofilter, {{biological filter}} and biological trickling filter {{are often used}} to refer to <b>a</b> <b>trickling</b> filter.

25|$|In 1837 {{during the}} Caroline affair, a rebel supply ship, the Caroline, was burned and sent over the falls.

25|$|The British Army {{evaluated}} the Mark E, but rejected it, apparently due {{to questions about}} {{the reliability of the}} suspension.

25|$|Julys in {{northern}} Illinois are often hot and dry and the Kishwaukee River {{is little more}} than <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> at times, at the least its water levels are extremely low. DeKalb had a plan though. The residents of the city agreed to go without water for the weekend and two dams were quickly constructed on the Kishwaukee. Nearly every member of the community turned out to help dredge mud in key locations and replace it with gravel and pebbles.|$|E
25|$|Mobile grew {{substantially}} {{in the period}} {{leading up to the}} Civil War, when the Confederates heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a blockade under the command of Admiral David Farragut. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> of trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} hoopla {{over the}} domestic violence and civil killings provoked a massive police operation in the city with 2000 policemen surrounded the Pacco Qillo locality.

There was only <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> of internal migrations before the operation, but the operation triggered a mass exodus of population. The Muhajir migrated en masse from Qasimabad and the interior of Sindh into Latifabad. Similarly, the Sindhis people moved to Qasimabad from Hyderabad and Latifabad.|$|E
