5|$|A {{scheme for}} an {{extension}} of the Avon Navigation was proposed in 1766, but canals did not reach the coalfield for almost another 50 years.

Coal was transported by the Somerset Coal Canal and later by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which were accessed from the pits by a series of tramways. After 1854, when the first railway line was opened, the tonnage carried by the coal canal declined rapidly.|$|E

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> <b>to</b> advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> <b>to</b> investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect <b>a</b> <b>committee</b> <b>to</b> buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
