There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to {{different stages of}} breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E

There, he finds Professor Frink, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: nuclear waste. He {{plans to use the}} alien ship's tractor beam to suck up cars that <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three more, into the aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of Foolish Earthlings.|$|E

Loading of transmitter is {{an active}} process requiring a neurotransmitter transporter and a proton pump ATPase that provides an electrochemical gradient.

Characterization of unc-17 and unc-47, which encode the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and vesicular GABA transporter have been described to date.|$|E
25|$|Zeolites have uses in {{advanced}} reprocessing methods, where their micro-porous ability to capture some ions while allowing others to pass freely, allowing many fission products to be efficiently removed from nuclear waste and permanently trapped. Equally important are the mineral properties of zeolites. Their alumino-silicate construction is extremely durable and resistant to radiation even in porous form. Additionally, once they <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> trapped fission products, the zeolite-waste combination can be hot pressed into an extremely durable ceramic form, closing the pores and trapping the waste in a solid stone block. This {{is a waste}} form factor that greatly reduces its hazard compared to conventional reprocessing systems. Zeolites are also used {{in the management of}} leaks of radioactive materials. For example, {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, sandbags of zeolite were dropped into the seawater near the power plant to adsorb radioactive caesium which was present in high levels.|$|E
5000|$|Flintlock muskets {{were the}} {{mainstay}} of European armies between 1660 and 1840. A musket was a muzzle-loading smoothbore long gun that <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> a round lead ball, {{but it could also}} <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> shot for hunting. For military purposes, the weapon <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> ball, or a mixture of ball with several large shot (called buck and ball), and had an effective range of about 75 to 100 metres. Smoothbore weapons that were designed for hunting birds were called [...] "fowlers." [...] Flintlock muskets tended to be of large caliber and usually had no choke, allowing them to fire full-caliber balls.|$|R

Allmusic's Chris Witt stated that [...] "Emcees Buckshot and 5ft Accelerator attack their verses with an aggressive nihilism not heard since Kool G Rap's peak." [...] 5ft, originally known as 5FT Accelerator, [...] appears on three tracks here, and his lyrical content does not differ from that of Buckshot's. Unlike later work by New York City peers like Nas, the lyrical content found here does not peer deeply into social issues or provide much substance. Allmusic's album review stated that [...] "Theirs is a grim reality, filled with guns, weed and violence. Buckshot displays none of the usual gangster remorse, he is a willful public menace." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E

Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E
