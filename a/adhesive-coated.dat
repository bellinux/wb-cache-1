5000|$|Spawning usually {{occurs in}} fresh water during warm weather; the {{breeding}} season generally spans from spring to autumn. After spawning with the male, the female fish lays rows of about 3,000 <b>adhesive-coated</b> eggs. The eggs stick to various surfaces, such as plants, logs, rocks, or sand. The male then fertilizes them with [...] "sperm lines". The male guards the eggs until the young fish hatch, which usually takes 10-14 days. After hatching, the young fish go downstream to estuaries, where their development takes place. Once grown, the fish return to fresh water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{experiments}} with glass and plastic beads covering {{a wide range}} of particle sizes and weights are used to develop a two-step, stochastic model of particle selection by deposit-feeders. These experiments include measurements of selectivity as a function of transport distance along a terebellid (polychaete) tentacle, {{of the degree to which}} a food source can be depleted of the preferred particle type by a terebellid, of selectivity by spionids (polychaetes) having lost their tentacles, of selectivity by an ampharetid (polychaete) as a function of available particle types, and of "selectivity " by <b>adhesive-coated</b> microscope slides. A large component of mechanical selection is seen to be achieved at the point of particle pick-up. The first step of the heuristic model is particle contact by the tentacle. By appealing to the Delesse principle and to the results with <b>adhesive-coated</b> slides, the probability of particle contact is shown to be a function of particle size. On a per-particle basis, larger particles have a higher probability of being contacted by a tentacle than do smaller ones. The second step is the retention of the particle given that it has been contacted. It is suggested that the conditional (i. e., given contact) probability of such retention is a function of the adhesive strength of the mucus found on the tentacle and that it will depend on both particle weight per unit surface area and particle surface characteristics. In general, the conditional probability of retention will be a decreasing function of submerged particle weight per unit surface area An important deduction from this model is that size-selection in tentaculate deposit-feeders need have no morphological correlates; the lower the adhesive strength of the mucus, the greater will be the animal's selectivity for smaller, lighter particle...|$|E
40|$|Reweaving and reknitting {{techniques}} rebuild {{losses in}} textiles by replacing damaged yams to duplicate original structures and patterns. Traditionally viewed as restorative methods used mainly for consumer clothing and household furnishings, reweaving and reknitting have much potential for {{adaptation to the}} repair and stabilization of historic and collectible textiles. Standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques utilize handsewn underlay and overlay patches and <b>adhesive-coated</b> underlay supports. Although these techniques can provide practical and time-saving approaches {{for a wide variety}} of situations, problems with these techniques can sometimes develop over the long term when issues of structural integrity and appearance are concerned. While reweaving and reknitting techniques can provide superior aesthetic and structural results, they require more time and are more costly. This study evaluated the possibility of expanding the use of reweaving and reknitting techniques in the repair and stabilization of damaged textiles to meet textile conservation challenges. The research involved a panel review of actual textiles that had received various stabilizing treatments and a statistical analysis of the evaluation data. This report includes detailed instructions outlining basic reweaving and reknitting techniques and a discussion of applying these and traditional treatments to woven and knit fabrics. Three different reweaving or reknitting techniques, applying an underlay with hand stitching, and attaching an <b>adhesive-coated</b> backing were used to repair damaged fabrics. The textiles treated represented a range of woven and knitted structures including a plain weave I low thread count, plain weave I high thread count, twill weave, patterned weave, stockinet knit, double knit, and patterned knit. Each of the three treatments was applied to each of the seven fabrics. The 21 fabric I treatment combinations were examined by a panel of reviewers and evaluated with respect to specific qualities of visual appearance, structural integrity, and effect of repair on drape. They recorded their rating on a Visual Analogue Scale. The evaluators (n = 49) of the treated fabrics gave the reweaving and reknitting treatments statistically significantly higher ratings in all of the three qualities reviewed compared with the treatment samples repaired with standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques. These repairs took the longest time to complete with average completion times ranging from 2. 63 to 17. 50 hours per sample. The treatment samples repaired with the textile conservation techniques of applying an underlay with hand stitching and an <b>adhesive-coated</b> backing received the lowest ratings in all of the three qualities with no statistically significant difference between the means of these two conservation techniques. Both textile conservation techniques took the least time to complete with average completion times ranging from 0. 88 to 2. 00 hours. The high ratings that the reweaving and reknitting treatment samples received in this research suggest the need for curators and conservators to be aware of the benefits of reweaving and reknitting and consider using these techniques to repair objects that merit the time and expenditure required. This research confirmed the lack of current, thorough information on reweaving and reknitting techniques and negligible commentary in the textile conservation literature to explain the application of these methods; this seems to indicate their minimal use or consideration in the field...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{microarray}} (TMA) is a powerful, high-throughput {{technique for}} in situ investigation of biomarkers in many tissue samples in a paraffin block by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH), and has rapidly become the standard in marker studies. One of the difficult steps in the procedure is the sectioning of array blocks and mounting of sections using special slides and/or <b>adhesive-coated</b> tape, which demands specific experience and is time-consuming. We report an arraying method that allows melting of the receiving paraffin block and subsequent sectioning like any ordinary paraffin-embedded tissue block. The major difference from the standard microarray technique is the use of an agarose matrix in the recipient block. The agarose matrix allows melting of the paraffin without disturbing the array, resulting in perfect integration of the tissue cores. The agarose-paraffin TMA blocks limit tissue core loss during cutting, mounting, or immunohistochemical or FISH staining and better maintains the array...|$|E

40|$|Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) {{allows for}} the {{one-step}} procurement of large homogeneous populations of cells from tissue sections. In mammals, LCM {{has been used to}} conduct cDNA microarray and proteomics studies on specific cell types. However, LCM has not been applied to plant cells, most likely because plant cell walls make it difficult to separate target cells from surrounding cells and because ice crystals can form in the air spaces between cells when preparing frozen sections. By fixing tissues, using a cryoprotectant before freezing, and using an <b>adhesive-coated</b> slide system, it was possible to capture large numbers (� 10, 000) of epidermal cells and vascular tissues (vascular bundles and bundle sheath cells) from ethanol:acetic acid–fixed coleoptiles of maize. RNA extracted from these cells was amplified with T 7 RNA polymerase and used to hybridize a microarray containing � 8800 maize cDNAs. Approximately 250 of these were expressed preferentially in epidermal cells or vascular tissues. These results demonstrate that the combination of LCM and microarrays makes it feasible to conduct high-resolution global gene expression analyses of plants.

40|$|The {{influence}} of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) concentration on the peel strengthof an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) {{has been studied}} as a functionof the adhesive thickness. Different amounts of PVP (2 - 30 % w/w) were mixed thoroughly with an acrylic PSA. Films with different thicknesses (10, 40, and 70 μm) were prepared by casting the formulation on a poly(ethylene terephtalate) film. Peel tests were carried out by <b>adhesive-coated</b> tapes of 25 mm width on the stainless steel substrate at least for three samples. The samples were investigated by Fourier trans-mittance infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique and surface tension and viscoelas-tic properties measurements. The peel strength values are directly dependent on the thickness of adhesive. Also, results showed that due to the polar part of blend in 2 %w/w PVP, the peel strength has the maximum value. At higher concentrations of PVP, due to its surface migration, reduction in peel strength was more pronounced. The parallel investigations on the viscoelastic properties of blends showed that the storage modulus shifts to higher values at higher concentrations of PVP. Therefore, the bonding step becomes difficult and the peel strength decreases significantly...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{protocol}} for rapid and high-quality sample preparation prior to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) {{has been developed}} by coating bare stainless steel plates with one of three adhesives: mineral oil, glycerol, or Vaseline. The advantages of these three adhesive coats are that they take little time to both prepare and wipe away, hold the matrices {{to prevent them from}} flying from the support, reduce the background matrix, and affect neither the resolution of the peptide peaks nor the accuracy of their determined molecular masses. Consequently, the signal intensity, detection limit, and tolerance of the analytes to contaminants on the three <b>adhesive-coated</b> plates are improved. In the two strategies of on-plate desalting and concentration of the peptide mixture, all three adhesives reduced the loss of peptides, {{especially in the case of}} larger molecular mass peptides. The microscope and stereo microscope images of the deposited droplets showed that after dropping onto the adhesive coats, the droplets formed a reduced spot size, were more homogeneous, and showed sticky crystallization. Therefore, this is an easy-to-use, reproducible, highly sensitive, tolerant (to salts), and high-throughput method of peptide sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{demonstrated}} the fluidic self-assembly of micromachined silicon parts onto silicon and quartz substrates in a preconfigured pattern with submicrometer positioning precision. Self-assembly is accomplished using photolithographically defined part and substrate binding sites that are complementary shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers. The patterned substrate is passed through a film of hydrophobic adhesive on water, causing the adhesive to selectively coat the binding sites. Next, the microscopic parts, fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers and {{ranging in size from}} 150 150 15 m 3 to 400 400 50 m 3, are directed toward the substrate surface under water using a pipette. Once the hydrophobic pattern on a part comes into contact with an <b>adhesive-coated</b> substrate binding site, shape matching occurs spontaneously due to interfacial free energy minimization. In water, capillary forces of the adhesive hold the parts in place with an alignment precision of less than 0. 2 m. Permanent bonding of the parts onto quartz and silicon is accomplished by activating the adhesive with heat or ultraviolet light. The resulting rotational misalignment is within 0. 3. Using square sites, 98 -part arrays have been assembled in less than 1 min with 100 % yield. The general microassembly approach described here may be applied to parts ranging in size from the nano- to milliscale, and part and substrate materials including semiconductors, glass, plastics, and metals.

The machine serves to coat a continuous moving <b>adhesive-coated</b> PET foil with a layerof acrylate resin, and then place sub-mm balls, which are arranged in a tight pattern on arotating drum, accurately onto the foil. After that, the resin is hardened in a UV-light cure, andthe foil undergoes one more processing step before being rolled on a winder roll.

Also, In the currentconcept, the drum drives the foil via the balls on its surface. It is uncertain whether the foilvelocity can be controlled this way, and whether the balls can still be placed with sufficientaccuracy if this is not the case. In the experimental setup, a pattern of balls is transferred froma rotating drum onto a moving foil coated with adhesive and resin. The drum and foilvelocities are controlled independently. The primary purpose of the experimental setup is toinvestigate whether it is possible to accurately transfer the pattern of balls from the drum ontothe moving foil, and what velocity differences between drum and foil can be tolerated.

Methods: Under controlled conditions, it is possible to scrutinize SACD and CSSS with objectivity using appropriate methods of analytical morphology. These procedures apply to a series of clinical conditions including xerosis grading, comedometry, corneodynamics, corneomelametry, corneosurfametry, corneoxenometry, and dandruff assessment. Results: With any of the analytical evaluations, SACD and CSSS provide specific salient information that is useful in the field of cosmetology. In particular, both methods appear valuable and complementary in assessing the human skin compatibility of personal skincare products. Conclusion: A set of quantitative analytical methods applicable to the minimally invasive and low-cost SACD and CSSS procedures allow for a sound assessment of cosmetic effects on the stratum corneum. Under regular conditions, both methods are painless and do not induce adverse events. Globally, CSSS appears more precise and informative than the regular SACD stripping.

40|$|The {{inertial}} impaction of Lycopodium spores on single wires lying transverse to {{the direction of}} flow has been studied. The equations of particle motion in a potential flow field have been modified for the case when Stokes' law is inapplicable. Solutions to the above equations have been obtained by digital computation. Rec, the Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter, varied from 4 to 240; particle trajectories in a flow field at Rec = 10 have been determined for inertia parameter K = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Ten trajectories were developed for the above cases by the numerical stepwise method. Experiments were performed by depositing Lycopodium spores on <b>adhesive-coated</b> wires of various diameters and at different velocities. The weight of dust deposited was determined with a microbalance. The experimental conditions were:. Wire diameters: 345, 457, 1500 μ. Particle diameter: 35 μ. Air velocities: 20 - 250 cm/sec. Inertia parameter: 1 - 60. The particle was considered as a point mass in the theoretical analysis. But in the experiments the ratio of particle size to wire size was not negligible (rp/rc = 0 · 1) and hence the effect of finite size of particle on collection efficiency due to the direct interception effect has been estimated. The effect of particle size distribution on collection efficiency has also been estimated. The experimental efficiencies obtained compare well with the calculated efficiencies at Rec = 10 when direct interception is taken into account...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} multi-robot {{application}} {{from the field of}} industrial automation. The multi-robot system forms the central part of a novel kind of profile wrapping machine, which is used to laminate decorative surfaces onto profiles, e. g. parts for window frames. The robots operate in a confined area and perform different tasks such as re-tooling and setting up machine parts simultaneously as quick and as accurate as possible. During lamination, each robot uses a special roller to press the <b>adhesive-coated</b> surface onto the profile. For this application, we use a scalable number of at least 10 and up to 50 standard articulated-arm robots. The system consists of three lines of robots, three movable depots capable of holding hundreds of different rollers and a computer with a fieldbus interface allowing for communication with additional machine components like servo converters. On the computer runs custom software and serves as a central control unit. The control software receives the given reference values, like roller positions and desired pressure, and distributes them to the robots. Robot actions are triggered, monitored and synchronized by the central control unit, but every robot performs its tasks autonomously. The main control unit and robots communicate via standard Ethernet, since time-critical actions can be handled on each robot's own controller. User interface and sophisticated software modules allowing for a completely automated machine configuration are also linked to the control system via Ethernet, as well as any additional components like data logging or remote service applications. Tests revealed that the multi-robot approach for profile wrapping reduces set-up time from more than 1. 5 hrs on conventional machines to approximately five minutes. At the same time, it ensures a higher and more constant process quality as the system autonomously compensates for wear of rollers or variation in the profile's geometry...|$|E
40|$|Aedes aegypti is {{the main}} vector of dengue worldwide. A highly {{anthropophilic}} and endophilic mosquito, its behaviour is {{a major influence on}} dengue epidemiology and a major challenge to vector control, which is the only dengue prevention method available. A series of studies into host-seeking and resting behaviour were carried out in the laboratory. In Penang, Malaysia, the efficacy of standard and a novel modified form of indoor residual spraying was evaluated in a field trial and the insecticide susceptibility of local vector populations was determined. Arrival patterns of female Ae. aegypti were investigated at a seated human-bait protected by an <b>adhesive-coated</b> net. Mosquitoes preferentially landed on the top and nearest upper vertical surfaces of the net, clustering in a region above the volunteer’s head. Although not previously reported in Ae. aegypti, this behaviour supported the proposition that a plume of potential host attractants rises from the human host. Resting preferences of unfed female Ae. aegypti were investigated using simple two-dimensional panel targets and resting boxes. Exploring the influence of colour, texture, adhesive and target height, the highest resting rates were found on black targets in a vertical configuration at 90 cm above ground. Target texture and adhesive factor did not influence target attractiveness. Data also indicated that female Ae. aegypti were randomly distributed on the panels. In laboratory tests, significantly higher numbers of mosquitoes were captured in resting boxes by raising internal humidity to over 65 %. However, a field test in Malaysia did not capture any Aedes sp., although Cx. quinquefasciatus were caught. A randomised-controlled trial was conducted in Penang, Malaysia to investigate the effect of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus populations. Two insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin and pirimiphos-methyl) were delivered either by standard (entire interior surface sprayed) or selective IRS (upper walls and ceilings sprayed) methods. Throughout the three-month study, entomological indices fluctuated considerably and, while there was some evidence of an overall effect throughout the study area, due to a number of confounders comparison between treatments was not possible and the outcome was ultimately inconclusive. At the trial study site in Penang, the insecticide susceptibility status of local populations of Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were investigated. All were found to be resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin. For pirimiphos-methyl, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus remained susceptible but Cx. quinquefasciatus was classed as ‘suspected resistance’ and potential resistance management strategies are discussed. The study has demonstrated the potential to improve traps or targets for Ae. aegypti by simple alterations to their design. The potential of IRS in the control of dengue vectors remains to be confirmed. The data on emerging insecticide resistance in the mosquito vector populations is timely and provides an evidence base for local authorities to reconsider management strategies that are currently in place for the control of dengue vectors in Malaysia...|$|E
