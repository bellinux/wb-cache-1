5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their <b>allotted</b> <b>time,</b> unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or {{they may have to}} make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the <b>allotted</b> <b>time.</b> Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the <b>allotted</b> <b>time.</b> For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their <b>allotted</b> <b>time</b> however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E
5|$|To {{help promote}} {{the song and}} album, Yankovic {{directed}} a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented {{as if they are}} one-act plays before an audience of people. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the <b>allotted</b> <b>time</b> that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento and Judy Tenuta.|$|E
5|$|By age 11, he had {{exhausted}} {{the mathematical}} knowledge of two {{college students who}} were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the <b>allotted</b> <b>time,</b> and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it could not be solved by radicals.|$|E

5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The <b>allotted</b> <b>time</b> for multiplayer {{is limited to a}} few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
5|$|Her refit at Portsmouth Dockyard {{began in}} March 1914 and was {{interrupted}} by the declaration of war on Germany on 4 August. She'd been formally recommissioned the day prior, but the turret work required another week to complete. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire-control director, but this could not be completed in the <b>allotted</b> <b>time</b> and would remain inoperable until she was refitted after the Battle of the Falkland Islands. She was declared operational on 12 August, when Rear-Admiral Sir Archibald Gordon Moore, commanding the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag in her. He was ordered to the Humber, along with the battlecruiser , where he could better support the British ships patrolling the Broad Fourteens.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the <b>allotted</b> <b>time.</b> Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E

5|$|Teams only {{averaged}} around 80 {{points per}} game {{in the years following}} the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946. Before the introduction of the shot clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable. Starting in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the <b>allotted</b> <b>time,</b> they would lose possession. This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games. All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.|$|E
5|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{features}} team-based and deathmatch-based multiplayer modes {{on various}} maps. Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player {{has reached a}} predefined number of points, or the <b>allotted</b> <b>time</b> expires {{in which case the}} team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode is activated {{in which there is no}} re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. The main aim {{for this}} {{presented}} {{work is to}} prove that higher efficiencies can be achieved when considering <b>allotted</b> drying <b>time</b> as a parameter of the drying cycle. This thesis explains how to theoretically calculate the most efficient drying parameters for wheat based on the ambient conditions and <b>allotted</b> drying <b>time.</b> Drying in the constant and falling rates will be discussed with mathematical models developed for each drying period. Drying air temperatures between 290 and 370 Kelvin, and drying air velocities between 0. 3 and 5. 3 meters per second will be explored. The wheat will be dried from a moisture content of 0. 22 kilograms of water per kilograms of dry basis to a moisture ratio of 0. 05. Energy and exergy efficiencies are utilized as a determining factor for most efficient drying parameters. The results prove that the dryer is most efficient when ran at 370 Kelvin and 0. 3 meters per second when the <b>allotted</b> drying <b>time</b> is less than 21. 7 hours. An <b>allotted</b> drying <b>time</b> between 21. 7 and 25. 4 hours would require a drying air temperature between 290 and 293 Kelvin, and a drying air velocity of 0. 3 meters per second. If the <b>allotted</b> drying <b>time</b> is greater than 25. 4 hours then ambient drying air temperature is most efficient due to no energy input. The mathematical models are compared to experimental results and show a good correlation with an average percent error of 5. 9 percent. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
