5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|This defeat infuriated the Caliph, who {{prepared}} a new expedition. Intended {{as a show}} of force and a clear display of the Caliphate's superiority, it was the largest army sent against Byzantium {{in the second half of}} the 8th century: it allegedly comprised 95,793 men, about twice the total Byzantine military establishment present in Asia Minor, and cost the Abbasid state some 1.6 million nomismata, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Byzantine Empire's entire annual income. Harun was the nominal leader, but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him.|$|E

25|$|Demi-god realm (Asura): the demi-gods have {{pleasure}} and abundance <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the gods, but {{they spend their}} time fighting among themselves or making war on the gods.

25|$|Rodent prey {{is usually}} {{dominated}} by locally superabundant species, like the delicate vesper mouse (Calomys tener) in southern Brazil. Among squamates and amphibians, small lizards like the {{tropical house gecko}} (Hemidactylus mabouia), and frogs and toads predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual. The largest prey are usually birds, such as eared doves (Zenaida auriculata) which may weigh <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a burrowing owl.|$|E
25|$|Sunshine {{hours on}} the coast are around 3,200 per year, {{from an average of}} 5–6 hours of {{sunshine}} per day in December to an average of 12–13 hours in July.

In December, London receives about 50 hours of sunshine while coastal locations in Cyprus about 180 hours (<b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> in May in London).|$|E

25|$|During the {{overland}} journey, {{they stopped}} at Salt Lake City, where Ludlow found an industrious and sincere group of settlers. He brought to the city prejudice and misgiving about the Mormons, and a squeamishness about polygamy which embarrassed him <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> his first view of a household of multiple wives. “I, a cosmopolitan, {{a man of the}} world, liberal to other people’s habits and opinions to a degree which had often subjected me to censure among strictarians in the Eastern States, blushed to my very temples,” he writes.|$|E
25|$|Powered {{by three}} 2,300 ihp triple-expansion steam engines, two driving {{four-bladed}} propellers in the stern and one powering a third propeller in the bow, Suur Tõll {{was one of}} the most powerful icebreakers in the Gulf of Finland. All moving parts had been dimensioned 35% stronger than in other ships of similar power. She had six coal-fired boilers equipped with mechanical ventilation, burning 3.5 tons of coal per hour in normal operation and four tons during ramming. Her fuel stores could hold 700 tons of coal, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the cargo capacity of a small cargo ship of the time.|$|E
25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females trying it more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called Naloxone, which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Humble eBook Bundle, John Scalzi {{noted that}} various factors, such as brand name recognition, a lack of DRM, a focus on charity, the {{uniqueness}} of the bundle and its format, and the variety of included authors, all made the Humble eBook Bundle a success. Scalzi notes that while people who participate in Humble Bundles will get less in net profit than they would have without the bundle (due to the variable percentages patrons can donate and publishers taking their cut of proceeds), but in return receive greater volume (the Humble Bundle sold 42,000 copies of eBooks in two weeks, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the average monthly bestseller). In conclusion, Scalzi lauds the idea of the Humble Bundle, and notes to future contributors that while the bundle is low-margin, it's also low-risk. Novelist Cory Doctorow, who organized both eBook bundles, noted that while no publisher aside from Tor Books would participate in the bundle because of no-DRM stipulations, they still raised around $2 million for books whose circulations were earning their authors little to no money.|$|E
