500|$|The settlement's name {{derives from}} the Sheriff's March; an ancient, {{biannual}} procession first held in 1278. An inquisition at Tynemouth declared that the King of Scotland, the Archbishop of York, the Prior of Tynemouth, the Bishop of Durham and Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus should meet the justices before they entered Newcastle from the south. A procession was held before the meeting; on the appointed day the procession started in Newcastle, crossed the River Tyne to Gateshead and made its way up the steep road. The meeting place was initially at Chile Well but subsequently the procession came to [...] "light <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house". The house was the Old Cannon public house, where drink was served at the sheriff's expense. When the judges arrived, the procession returned to Newcastle.|$|E

Then, they find the {{skeleton}} <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inlet pipe to see where the body came from. They find that the pipe leads to a ladder which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his [...] "Memories" [...] box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers.|$|E

According to a Billboard report in September 2006, she and her choreographers were working on ideas for a world tour, but the singer was still not prepared to share these ideas. However, the unnamed tour was canceled after she signed a record deal with Island Records, and company executives asked her to record a new album instead, which became Discipline. Jackson stated, [...] "I was supposed to go on tour with the last album [...] We were actually in full-blown tour rehearsals at that point ... learning numbers, getting everything together, set designs [...] I had to kind of shut everything down <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio." ...|$|E

Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title [...] "Ain't I a Woman?," [...] a variation of the original speech re-written by someone else using a stereotypical Southern dialect; whereas Sojourner Truth was from New York and grew up speaking Dutch as her first language. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.|$|E
2500|$|INC {{believes}} {{that a person is}} composed of a body ("vehicle"), soul ("individual") and spirit ("life" [...] or fuel). Members believe that when a person dies, his/her body and soul both die <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grave where both will remain until the Second Coming of Christ, whereas the spirit will go back to God. [...] Upon Christ's return, all dead servants of God, {{from the time of the}} patriarchs up to the last days, would be resurrected to join living faithful and loyal INC members. They will be rewarded by living in the Holy City or New Jerusalem, together with God the Father, and Jesus Christ. After 1,000 years, a second resurrection would occur, and non-INC members will experience second death which is the Lake of Fire (Dagát-dagatang Apóy).|$|E
2500|$|The young Luckner had {{dreams of}} being a sailor, but his father was {{determined}} that he should follow the family tradition <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cavalry. After failing his exams at various private schools, {{at the age of}} thirteen Luckner ran away to sea, with the promise in his mind that he would not return until he was wearing [...] "the Emperor's naval uniform, and with honour". He signed up, under the assumed name of [...] "Phylax Lüdecke", as an unpaid cabin boy on the Russian sailing ship Niobe travelling between Hamburg (Germany) and Australia. His story might have ended there, because the Russian captain, fearing that the lives of other crew members would be endangered, refused to allow a lifeboat to be launched in order to pick Luckner up when he fell overboard {{in the middle of the}} ocean. The chief mate defied the captain (who had threatened him with a harpoon), and launched a lifeboat with the help of volunteers. As a number of albatrosses circled over Luckner, one swooped down and seized his outstretched hand in its beak, but Luckner grabbed the bird in desperation. Although severely pecked, he hung on for his life. The flapping of the bird's huge wings and the circling of the other albatrosses gave the crew of the lifeboat a point to aim at in his rescue.|$|E

2500|$|Bowie had {{reconnected}} with Brian Eno at {{his wedding}} to Iman Abdulmajid in 1992. Bowie and Eno each played pieces {{of their own}} music at the wedding reception and delighted at the [...] "ebb and flow" [...] of couples on the dance floor. At that point, Bowie knew [...] "we were both interested in nibbling at {{the periphery of the}} mainstream rather than jumping in. We sent each other long manifestoes about what was missing in music and what we should be doing. We decided to really experiment <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio with not even a gnat of an idea." [...] Bowie and Eno visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna, Austria in early 1994 and interviewed and photographed its patients, who were famous for their [...] "Outsider art". Bowie and Eno brought some of that art back with them into the studio as they worked together in March 1994, coming up with a three-hour piece that was mostly dialogue. Late in 1994, Q magazine asked Bowie to write a diary for 10 days (to later be published in the magazine), but Bowie, fearful his diary would be boring ("...going to a studio, coming home and going to bed"), instead wrote a diary for one of the fictional characters (Nathan Adler) from his earlier improvisation with Eno. Bowie said [...] "Rather than 10 days, it became 15 years in his life!" [...] This became the basis for the story of 1. Outside.|$|E
2500|$|Promptly upon {{taking the}} village, Captain Mills sent two bareback riders to tell General Crook {{that he had}} a village and was trying to hold and needed assistance. When Crook {{received}} word from Mills’s three messengers he could scarcely contain his anger at Mills. Crook was primarily interested in feeding his men and ordered Mills to avoid a fight should he encounter a large village, and instead, [...] "cut around it" [...] <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Black Hills to get supplies. [...] Crook also told Mills that he expected to bivouac his exhasted men and therefore Mills could not expect any immediate support. [...] Crook’s Officers debated the propriety of Mills’s attack on a hostile village of uncertain size, a controversy intensified by Custer’s defeat under like circumstances. The question was especially provocative since Mills had opened the engagement with a small supply of ammunition. Strahorn reported, [...] "Crook was very much disappointed because Mills didn’t report his discovery last night, and there was plenty of time to have got the entire command there and so effectively surrounded the village that nothing would have escaped. [...] But the General is also pleased, all things considered." [...] Staff officers in telling the receipt of this news said Crook pushed the cavalry on with all possible haste, the infantry to follow more leisurely. [...] But the tidings reaching Crook so electrified the immortal infantry that they forgot all about hunger, cold, wet and fatigue. [...] Fortunately for Mills, Crook’s column was not far behind. Crook assembled a relief contingent of about 250 men and 17 officers, plus surgeons Bennett A. Clements and Valentine T. Mcgillycuddy. [...] John Frederick Finerty, war correspondent for the Chicago Times, joined the advance column. Despite the hardships of the Horsemeat March, the troopers were excited by the prospects of a battle.|$|E
