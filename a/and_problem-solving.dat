5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|The program {{originally}} focused {{almost exclusively}} on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine direct and {{indirect}} relationships among personality, self-esteem <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving,</b> as well as the mediating role of self-esteem in the link between personality <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving</b> among Turkish youth. The study utilized a cross-sectional design comprising sev-eral self-reports. Data for the present study were collected from 687 undergraduate students. The participants included 428 (66 %) females and 220 (34 %) males, and their ages ranged from 18 to 35 years, with a mean of 22. 46 years (SD = 2. 45). Findings illustrated that extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness and self-esteem were significantly and positively correlated with social problem-solving, whereas neuroticism showed a negative correlation. Self-esteem is significantly and positively associated with extraversion, open-ness, conscientiousness, agreeableness <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving,</b> <b>and</b> it appears to act as a mediator in the relationship between personality <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving.</b> The findings indicated that personality and self-esteem directly affected social <b>problem-solving,</b> <b>and</b> personality also indirectly affected social problem-solving through self-esteem. In conclusion, personality and self-esteem were found to be significantly related to social problem-solving among Turkish youth...|$|R
5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> are apparent.|$|E

40|$|Emotional {{processing}} <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving</b> {{are important}} for mental well-being. For example, impaired emotional processing is linked with depression and psychosomatic problems. However, {{little is known about}} crosscultural differences in emotional processing <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving</b> <b>and</b> whether these constructs are linked. This study examines whether emotional processing <b>and</b> social <b>problem-solving</b> differs between Western (British) and Eastern European (Polish) cultures. Participants (N = 172) completed questionnaires assessing both constructs. Emotional processing did not differ according to culture, but Polish participants reported more effective social problem-solving abilities than British participants. Poorer emotional processing was also found to relate to poorer social problem-solving. Possible societal reasons for the findings and the implications of the findings for culture and clinical practice are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Since the 1960s, {{educators}} {{had seen}} Lego bricks' constructive potential {{as being an}} invaluable asset in helping children to develop creativity <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> abilities. Teachers had been using Lego bricks in the classroom {{for a variety of}} reasons. In 1980, the Lego Group established the Educational Products Department (eventually renamed Lego Dacta, in 1989), to expand the educational possibilities of their toys. A packing and assembly factory opened in Switzerland, followed by another in Jutland, Denmark that manufactured Lego tires.|$|E
25|$|A puzzle is {{a problem}} or enigma that {{challenges}} ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based {{on the process of}} inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik's Cube, invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> skills and involves algorithms.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematics}} {{and computer science}} undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> skills through teamwork. An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers {{around the world on}} their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from Microsoft Research Cambridge in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a Kinect through legal means.|$|E

25|$|Each {{semester}} {{begins with}} an immersion course. The two-week immersion focuses on litigation and alternative dispute resolution in the Fall semester and transactional practice in the Spring semester. Each student is then enrolled in practicum courses of their choosing. These courses cover substantive and advanced law but do so through practical methods of drafting paperwork <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> rather than casebook and the socratic method. Students are also required to take a course in the legal profession {{as well as a}} law-related service requirement. Finally, each student is required to be involved in one of W's legal clinics, externship programs, or transnational programs to gain real-client experience. The program is flexible and allows students the ability to tailor their schedule and, if they wish, to take several traditional casebook method courses.|$|E
25|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, {{possibly}} {{more so than}} any other order of invertebrates. The level of their intelligence and learning capability are debated, but maze <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> studies show they have both short- and long-term memory. Octopus have a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in their brain. Two-thirds of an octopus' neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of their arms. Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organized in their brain using an internal somatotopic map of their body, instead using a non-somatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates. Some octopuses, such as the mimic octopus, move their arms in ways that emulate the shape and movements of other sea creatures.|$|E
25|$|Developmental psychology, and {{especially}} the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge {{on a number of}} crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, {{can be used as a}} frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why Piaget's theory of cognitive development was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education. In the same direction, the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and working memory capacities that characterize successive age levels.|$|E

25|$|The Contestants {{were put}} through their paces in a Boot Camp cook-off. The wild card contestants, Bill and Jason, were {{designated}} team leaders {{and asked to}} split the finalists into 2 teams (red and blue). They proceeded through physical challenges that showcased their communication, teamwork <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> skills. The final task would be a cook off with the ingredients determined {{at the end of}} each round. If they won a challenge they were able to have first pick of the ingredients including meat or vegetables. The final team challenge was to start a fire from scratch. The contestants (in their teams) then had to cook a 4 course meal and damper on their camp-fires to impress the judges and feed the commandos who led them through the challenges. The winning team (blue) consisted of Fenton, Sophie, Bill and David. They defeated Ivan, Katie and Jason of the red team. The winning team was then put in the awkward position to choose one contestant from the losing team to eliminate and they had to name that person within 30 seconds. They chose to eliminate the strongest competitor.|$|E

40|$|Problem solving {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used as an}} important approach to learning especially in ill-structured domains. It is assumed that knowledge can be better consolidated <b>and</b> extended through <b>problem-solving</b> experience. However, many learners {{do not have the}} ability to separate general knowledge from specific cases, which inhibits successful transfer of knowledge to new situations. This study addressed the challenge by proposing a dual-mapping learning approach that involves argument mapping and concept mapping to externalize <b>and</b> integrate <b>problem-solving</b> <b>and</b> knowledge-construction processes in problem-based learning. A preliminary study of the design and effects of the approach is reported. Findings show its effectiveness in improving both <b>problem-solving</b> <b>and</b> knowledge-construction performance. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS) ...|$|R

500|$|One {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate insight <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> ability involved {{a piece of}} meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and [...] "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning." [...] This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.|$|E
500|$|Portal was {{the first}} Valve-developed game {{to be added to}} the OS X-compatible list of games {{available}} on the launch of the Steam client for Mac on May 12, 2010, supporting Steam Play, in which players that had bought the game either on a Macintosh or Windows computer could also play it on the alternate system. As part of the promotion, Portal was offered as a free title for any Steam user during the two weeks following the Mac client's launch. Within the first week of this offer, over 1.5 million copies of the game were downloaded through Steam. A similar promotion was held in September 2011, near the start of a traditional school year, encouraging the use of the game as an educational tool for science and mathematics. Valve wrote that they felt that Portal [...] "makes physics, math, logic, spatial reasoning, probability, <b>and</b> <b>problem-solving</b> interesting, cool, and fun", a necessary feature to draw children into learning. This was tied to Digital Promise, a United States Department of Education initiative to help develop new digital tools for education, and which Valve is part of.|$|E
