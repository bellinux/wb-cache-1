500|$|Jessie Bond {{wrote that}} Gilbert [...] "was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, {{and he could}} not bear to be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand." [...] George Grossmith wrote to The Daily Telegraph that, {{although}} Gilbert had been described as an autocrat at rehearsals, [...] "That was really only his manner when he was playing the part of stage director at rehearsals. As a matter of fact, he was a generous, kind true gentleman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> the word in the purest and original sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> the word advisedly) clever. It is also impressive, not merely {{as an act of}} impersonation but perhaps above all for the fiendish diligence with which it is carried out...presuppose(s) formidable research {{on the part of the}} author, who is American, educated in France and writing fluent, idiomatic and purposeful French. This tour de force, which not everyone will welcome, outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so for some time to come. No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks what it is that turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album. [...] "When you get into the studio, everything just comes out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Steiger {{decided to}} run for the U.S. Senate seat opened up by Paul Fannin's retirement. [...] His {{opponent}} during the Republican primary was fellow congressman John Bertrand Conlan. [...] The campaign between the two congressmen became ugly with Conlan saying [...] "We are both conservatives, but our style is different. He uses a meat ax <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> a scalpel" [...] and asking voters if they desired [...] "a Jew from New York telling Arizona what to do". [...] Steiger countered with [...] "John thinks of himself as a scalpel. I prefer to {{think of him as a}} Roto-Rooter," [...] and claiming [...] "Godzilla would make a better Senator than John Conlan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Four bronze [...] "{{spatulas}}" [...] (documents b, e, f, and i, with 40, 17, 48, and 84 characters, respectively). These spatulas {{have a more}} or less triangular {{shape with}} a [...] "flower stem" [...] handle at the sharpest angle of the triangle. They are about 5 by 9 centimeters and 1mm thick. It is not known what their function was, but Dunand thinks they are [...] "labels" [...] attached to, for example, votive objects. All spatulas are inscribed on both sides, except spatula e (one side only). The writing is relatively sloppy. The text on the back side of spatula f is the only text known that reads from left to right. Spatulae b <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>use</b> short vertical strokes as word dividers.|$|E
2500|$|Also, in {{a reading}} that Berryman gave at the Guggenheim Museum with Robert Lowell in 1963, he {{discusses}} {{the character of}} Henry by saying, [...] "Henry has a hard time. People don't like him, and he doesn't like himself. In fact, he doesn't even know what his name is. His name at one point seems to be Henry House, and at another point {{it seems to be}} Henry Pussycat[...] [...]He [...] has a 'friend' who calls him [...] Mr. Bones, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> friend in quotation marks because {{this is one of the}} most hostile friends who ever lived." [...] Controversially, the unnamed [...] "friend," [...] to whom Berryman refers, speaks in a Southern, black dialect and in [...] "blackface," [...] as Berryman indicates, suggesting a kind of literary minstrelsy.|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E

60|$|Their {{proper name}} would be Marsh-cock, which would enough {{distinguish}} {{them from the}} true Moor-cock or Black-cock.
