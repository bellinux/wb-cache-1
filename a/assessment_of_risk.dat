In the scoping, the goal {{and scope of the}} study are defined and the aspects to be addressed are decided upon. The inventory analysis includes gathering relevant information from the scenarios as well as collecting data on current state of the chosen aspects. <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and opportunities {{consists of}} three sub-steps. First, an analysis of interrelation between various factors described in the scenarios and environmental as well as social impacts is done based on factual knowledge, literature and workshops with experts and stakeholders. Then an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and opportunities is carried out through discussions in an assessment team based on the outcomes of the first step. Last, the results for environmental and social aspects are integrated. Finally, the results are interpreted.|$|R
