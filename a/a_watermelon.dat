If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized {{over the past several decades}} with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a {{young girl}} nicknamed Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) has plans for a summer {{vacation}} with her father (Saho Sasazawa) {{who had been in}} Italy scoring film music. Her father returns home and surprises Gorgeous by announcing she has a new stepmother, Ryoko Ema (Haruko Wanibuchi). This upsets Gorgeous as her mother had died years earlier. Gorgeous goes to her bedroom and writes a letter to her aunt asking if she could come visit her this summer instead. Gorgeous' aunt replies and allows her to come visit. Gorgeous invites her six friends, Prof (Ai Matsubara), Melody (Eriko Tanaka), Kung Fu (Miki Jinbo), Mac (Mieko Sato), Sweet (Masayo Miyako) and Fantasy (Kumiko Oba) to come along with her. On arriving at the aunt's house, the girls are greeted by Gorgeous' aunt (Yōko Minamida) to whom they present <b>a</b> <b>watermelon.</b>|$|E

25|$|The most {{well-known}} Revelle College tradition, the annual Watermelon Drop, takes place every June prior to finals week. The tradition began in 1965, when a physics professor asked {{his students to}} calculate the terminal velocity of <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> dropped from the seventh floor of Urey Hall. Prior to the event, Revelle College hosts a pageant to name <b>a</b> <b>Watermelon</b> Queen, who drops the watermelon from the same building each year.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature film}} {{based on the}} show, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, was {{released}} on April 13, 2007. The movie follows {{the origins of the}} Aqua Teens, which includes an exercise machine, Neil Peart of the band Rush, <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> slice named Walter Melon, and an appearance by heavy metal band Mastodon in the opening sequence. The film also introduces a fourth Aqua Teen, a chicken nugget named Chicken Bittle (voiced by Bruce Campbell). The Plutonians and the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, recurring characters, both make appearances in the movie, as well as the Mooninites, Dr. Weird and MC Pee Pants (this being his last appearance in the series).|$|E

50|$|Polyploidy can {{be induced}} {{to modify the}} number of {{chromosomes}} in a crop in order to influence its fertility or size. Usually, organisms have two sets of chromosomes, otherwise known as a diploidy. However, either naturally or {{through the use of}} chemicals, that number of chromosomes can change, resulting in fertility changes or size modification within the crop. Seedless watermelons are created in this manner; <b>a</b> 4-set chromosome <b>watermelon</b> is crossed with <b>a</b> 2-set chromosome <b>watermelon</b> to create <b>a</b> sterile (seedless) <b>watermelon</b> with 3 sets of chromosomes.|$|R

25|$|Prior {{received}} the NBC Denis Compton Award for young cricketers {{three times in}} his career. He has hit more than 1,000 first class runs {{over the course of}} two seasons, in 2003 when he won the County Championship with Sussex, and 2004, when his 1,158 runs, including 201 not out against Loughborough UCCE, was enough to be top-scorer for Sussex that season. In 2005 he made fewer runs, with 874, but also became Sussex's first choice wicket-keeper again after having shared duties with Tim Ambrose in the two previous seasons. He has won the County Championship three times (2003, 2006 and 2007) although in 2007 he did not take part as much as before due to his England duties. It was while playing against Shane Warne that Prior acquired the nickname of 'watermelons', after Warne mimicked Prior's walk to the crease, with 'his arms out as if he were carrying <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> under each arm'.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by W. David Powell at Wonder Graphics. He had seen old postcards at a {{drugstore}} in Athens, Georgia, one depicting a peach on a truck and <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> on a rail car. Believing them perfect for an Allman Brothers album, he purchased them and [...] "bought cans of pink and baby-blue Krylon spray paint and created a matted area to make the cards on a twelve-by-twenty-four LP cover." [...] He envisioned the album having [...] "an early-morning-sky feel." [...] He hand-lettered the band name and photographed it with a small Kodak camera, developing the photos at the drugstore. He then cut and pasted the letters {{on the side of}} the truck, underneath the peach.|$|E
500|$|Ken Kragen chaired a {{production}} meeting at a bungalow off Sunset Boulevard on January 25, 1985. There, Kragen {{and his team}} discussed where the recording sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, [...] "The single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a Bob Dylan—I guarantee you!—drives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in." [...] On the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, Tom Bahler, was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice. Bahler stated, [...] "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world." [...] Jones disagreed, stating that the task was like [...] "putting <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> in a Coke bottle". The following evening, Lionel Richie held a [...] "choreography" [...] session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.|$|E

500|$|Sound editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} {{the production of}} sound {{that went into the}} episode in an interview with Designing Sound: [...] "In 'Fracture', the villain has created a serum which several characters inject because of a type of post-hypnotic suggestion. He has invented a frequency generator which causes these people to crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. It was something like 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the signal generator plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed them so that they warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the American film Jaws, a {{proposition}} came from the [...] Toho film studio for Nobuhiko Obayashi to develop a similar script. To find inspiration for the story, Obayashi discussed ideas with his pre-teen daughter Chigumi Obayashi. Nobuhiko sought her ideas, believing that adults [...] "only think about things they understand ... everything stays on that boring human level" [...] while [...] "children can come up with things that can't be explained". Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her that felt like a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk.|$|E

Offended by Darryl's disdain for office safety training, Michael decides {{to demonstrate the}} risk of depression and suicide by jumping off the roof, landing on a hidden trampoline. When Michael tests out the trampoline by dropping <b>a</b> <b>watermelon</b> from the roof, it bounces off and hits an office worker's car, prompting it {{to be replaced by}} a bouncy castle hidden from the general view of the parking lot. [...] From the roof of the building, Michael talks dramatically about the dangers of depression. When the bouncy castle is discovered, Jim and Pam realize that Michael is [...] "going to kill himself pretending to kill himself." [...] The employees collectively talk Michael down from the roof, with Darryl doing most of the talking, to assure Michael that he is brave simply by living as himself. At the end, the car that was hit by the watermelon is revealed to be Stanley's (Leslie David Baker), who is shocked to see the mess.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known European {{reference to}} the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: [...] "They [...] have a green fruit which they call durian, as big as <b>a</b> <b>watermelon.</b> Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, {{with a combination of}} flavours." [...] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian. In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.|$|E
