5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E

In this paper, we clarify the definitions of Affordance <b>and</b> <b>Capability</b> using Coloured Petri Nets and Protocol models. The illustrating case {{is the process of}} drug injection. We show that different behaviour modelling techniques provide different precision for definition of Affordance <b>and</b> <b>Capability</b> <b>and</b> clarify the conceptual models of these notions. We generalise that the behaviour models can be used to improve the precision of conceptualization...|$|R

5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the communist regime. After the revolution, the units suffered {{from a lack of}} funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled {{in the past few years}} and the combat readiness <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> have regained full strength.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> improved over the course of its service life.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of the range <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E

40|$|Although {{previous}} research has addressed the interface and logical association among marketing, information technology (IT) and supply chain management, there have been few, if any, attempts to investigate how IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> influence supply chain integration (SCI). Thus, this study investigates the direct and interacting effects of IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> on SCI. The hypothesised relationships were tested using survey data gathered from 329 firms in China’s manufacturing industry. The results reveal that both IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> have a significant positive effect on SCI. Interestingly, no significant interaction effect was found, indicating that marketing IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> influence SCI independently, and not synergistically. However, while IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> do not interact, IT capability does mediate the impact of marketing capability on SCI...|$|R
5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities <b>and</b> <b>capabilities.</b> During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, , had a focus on responding to China's rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. This increase in spending did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF's size <b>and</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing <b>and</b> <b>capabilities,</b> but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three Armoured Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. As an ACR, the unit is equipped with M1A1 tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles, and M113 armoured personnel carriers. Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure <b>and</b> <b>capabilities,</b> each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a Combat Service Support Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st Armoured Regiment may be transferred to South Australia. In late 2015 one of the 1st Armoured Regiment's two tank squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.|$|E

5|$|In October 2001, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that it}} was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and Taliban positions, activities <b>and</b> <b>capabilities.</b> SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{formed a}} key element of the security force in place for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, and in the lead-up to the event the regiment underwent a period of modernisation, acquiring new equipment <b>and</b> <b>capabilities,</b> including the ability to respond to chemical, biological and radiological threats, as well as developing techniques for the clandestine boarding of moving ships at night. During the Games two SASR squadrons were available for counter-terrorist operations, with one designated to respond to incidents in Sydney and Canberra, while the other was on standby for incidents elsewhere. Defence involvement in domestic security increased after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, and the unit has since formed part of the security force for a range of international sporting and political events held in Australia, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Coolum, Queensland in March 2002, and the visit of US President George W. Bush to Canberra in October 2003. The SASR maintains TAG (West) to respond to incidents on the west coast of Australia. It also provided the training and use of their facilities to raise a second Tactical Assault Group in the 2nd Commando Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{had never}} led a {{fighting}} unit prior to the war, he was given his first command of an army in the Western Front as his superiors, and particularly Marshal Zhukov were impressed with his skills <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> as a staff officer. Zhukov, {{with the approval of}} STAVKA, appointed him commander of the 16th Army (2nd formation), (July 1942 – April 1943) replacing its former commander, Konstantin Rokossovsky who had been sent to command the Bryansk Front. The 16th Army transferred its troops to the 5th Army, and its command and staff were moved to the second echelon of the Western Front were the Army took up command of part of the 10th Army's troops, and its defensive positions. On 11 August, however, German forces mounted a surprise offensive on the southern flank of Western Front, splitting the 61st Army from the 16th Army which was not taking part in the Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive operation. The German forces threatened Bagramyan's left flank as he quickly moved his forces to counter their movements and halted them from advancing further on 9 September.|$|E
