40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} present a {{literature}} review about the characteristics, applications, and potential of avocado (Persea americana). Avocado {{is considered one of}} the main tropical fruits, as it contains fat-soluble vitamins which are less common in other fruits, besides high levels of protein, potassium and unsaturated fatty acids. <b>Avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> contains variable oil content, and is widely used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry, and in the production of commercial oils similar to olive oil. This fruit has been recognized for its health benefits, especially due to the compounds present in the lipidic fraction, such as omega fatty acids, phytosterols, tocopherols and squalene. Studies have shown the benefits of avocado associated to a balanced diet, especially in reducing cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular diseases. The processed <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> is an alternative to utilize fruits, which can be used in various value-added food products. Fluid extract of the avocado leaves is widely used in pharmaceutical products, mainly due to the diuretic characteristic of the present compounds in plant leaves. With the increasing research supporting the nutritional characteristics and benefits of avocado, the tendency is to increase the production and exploitation of this raw material in Brazil, as also observed in other countries...|$|E

40|$|Global {{emergence}} of resistance in bacteria to the antimicrobial agents {{has made it}} difficult for the physicians to find effective therapeutic agents for diseases caused by MDR - TB, MDR-Salmonella, MRSA, Ps. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Candida etc. Since long infectious disease are being cured by traditional practitioners with the help of herbs and higher plants. At present antibiotics, obtained from molds fungus or synthetically prepared have lost their efficacy. The new trend to combat the pathogens is to use water and organic extracts made from different parts of medicinal plants. In this study 30 medicinal plants and their different parts were screened for their in-vitro anti- microbial activity, anti-adhesion activity under in -vitro and in- vivo in rat model, their toxicity and immunomodulating properties in BALB/c mice. Screening for the antimicrobial activity was carried out against twenty different bacterial species that includes A TCC and clinical strains. The screening of antibacterial activity was performed by the agar well diffusion and micro broth dilution method. Beside water solution of Rosa centrifolia (rose) and fruit, leaves and stem solutions of C. fistula was also included. From among eleven plant spices, only clove aqueous extract showed broad-spectrum of antibacterial activity against Ps. Aerugenosae and S. agalactiae and others. The antibacterial component present in the clove was found to be heat stable as the autoclaving of the solutions did not affect its activity. Aqueous extracts of Rosa centrifolia (rose) and C. fistula (Amaltas) commonly used as therapeutic agents showed anti-microbial activity M. lysoditicus, Staph. aureus, C. pseudodiptheroid and Sh. dysenters, S. typhi, E. coli and S. pyogenes at significantly higher concentrations. Four fractions of organic extracts i. e. PI =P 2, 80 MR, EA 2 and ALCR from the fruit of C. fistula were also were found to inhibit MDR Salmonella typhi at a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) range of 125 - 500). Âµg/ml. Methanolic extract of leaf extract of Bombax ceiba was found to be effective against S. epidermidis, S. typhi, B. Subtilis. Shemamin-a novel pure compound isolated from the leaf extract of Bombax ceiba showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria, B. subtilis, Ps. aeroginosa, Sh dysenteri, C. pseudo diptheroid and E. cloacae. Third group of plant products including Persea americana mill (<b>avocado)</b> peel, <b>pulp,</b> Beta vulgaris (beet) root peel and pulp, Porphyra tenera (nori, Sea vegetable) and Solanum tuberosu (potato) Peel, sub-peel and core were screened against several pathogens [...] All the plant solutions and extracts had MIC value > 25 mg/ml except for Methanol extract of Persea americana peel that had MIC value for Klebsiella 6. 25 mg/ml, Proteus 1. 5 mg/ml, Candida 1. 5 mg/ml, Pseudomonas 1. 5 mg/ml, E coli type I 12. 5 mg/ml, Staph aureus 6. 25 mg/ml, Strep sanguis, Strep sobrinus and Ecoli > 25 mg/ml. Formulation of synergistic compound Since {{it takes a long time}} to introduce new anti- microbial compound, a short cut strategy is to prepare synergistic formulations. In this study, synergistic preparations were developed by combining fruit solution of C fistula that is an important medicine of Ayuverdic and traditional medicne with amoxicillin a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has lost its efficacy. The new formulation developed was named as Amoxy-cassia. It has already been patented by the Government of Pakistan (Patent serial number 137124). We preferred the use of water solution as both amoxicillin and Cfistula fruit have proven efficacy in oral dosage in aqueous form. Amoxy-cassia was formulated first by screening with disc diffusion method and further confirmed by the checkerboard titration method and time kill kinetics. This formulation is found effective against MDR Salmonella typhi, MRSA and Ecoli. MDR S typhi causes Typhoid Fever that is endemic in developing countries like Pakistan whereas MRSA is a common cause of nosocomial infections in the hospitalized patients. It has become the threat to hospital personnel, as it mostly invades the patients with knee and hip implantation. Urinogenital infections are very common especially among the women. Another synergistic combination, which was developed during this study, was between Shamimin and Amoxicillin named as Shamoxcillin. This preparation is found to be effective against S. typhi and E. coli. In- vitro anti-adhesion Activity of the Plant Products Infectious diseases can also be controlled by the inhibition of the attachment of bacterial strains to the host tissue. Because once pathogens are able to attain foothold on to the eukaryotic cell with the help of adhesins present in their pili, they survive there by enveloping themselves with the capsule that is recognized with difficulty by the human immune system. They then produce toxins and harmful products, which damage the tissues or interfere with the metabolic processes. Most important step in the pathogenesis of the disease is the adhesion of the pathogens to the host surface through the adhesin present in their pili. Periodantal diseases and dental caries are due to the adhesion of bacteria to the salivary pellicle like S. sanguinis, Aggregation to the polymer dextran e. g. S sobrinus and coaggregation of A. naeshlundii to S sanguinis. They may enhance subsequent colonization of Porphyra gingivalis that is associated with adult periodontis. Organism was treated with the extracts for one hour. Three models were set up for the study of adhesion. First one was attachment of S. sanguis to human â€˜Oâ€™ group blood, second was aggregation of S sobrinus with dextran and third was coaggregation of A. naeslundii Tl 4 Vl with S. sanguis 35. Importance of controlling the dental plaque lies in the fact that most of the pathogens like Streptococcal species present in the dental plaque is responsible for causing pulmonary disease and bacterial endocarditis. The pathogens invade the lung and heart through oral cavity. All four plants studied including - Beta vulgaris (beet) root, Persea americana mill (avocado), Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Porphyra tenera (sea vegetable -Nori) has the potential of interfering with the adhesion of bacteria to host epithelial surfaces. The most significant feature of this finding is that the water solutions of all the plants are playing an important role in the anti-adhesion activity of these plants. From this we can say that when avocado, Beetroot, Potato and sea vegetable is eaten, the components of the plant material get in contact with the bacteria present in plaque and thereby result in inhibition of colonization of bacteria on the teeth surface. Urinary infections caused mainly by E. coli are among the most common infectious diseases. Most of the uropathogenic E. coli can express type P. fimbriae and I that contain adhesin, which recognizes cell receptors present on the host cells. In our assays, we found that water extracts of P. tenera (sea vegetable) and B. vulgarts (beet) root inhibited the adhesion of E. coli to guinea pig RBC thus inhibiting infection of oral surfaces. Most significant inhibition of adhesion to RBCs was observation with P. americana (avocado) extract It would suggest that just like cranberry juice, avocado juice can also be consumed to avoid urinary tract infections with E. coli Type- 1. The result of our study reveals that all the four plants studied Beta vulgaris (beet) root, Persea americana mill (avocado), Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Porphyra tenera (sea vegetable) has the potential to interfere with the adhesion of all the oral bacteria. Those combinations in which treated S. sanguis and A. naeshlundii which showed lower haemagglutination titer as compared to the titer of untreated bacteria were further checked by the flow cytometery technique. The flow cytometery result confirmed our first result obtained. Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) and asparaginase are the two plants enzymes that show anti-adhesion activity in vitro. These compound were tested for their in-vivo anti-adhesion activity against S. agalactiae (GBS) that normally resides in the female vagina and cause neonatal meningitis. GBS infects neonates during their passage through the vagina birth canal. It is one of the leading causes of due to neonatal meningitis. From our rat infection model it was concluded that treatment of animals post infection with plant enzymes like polyphenol oxidase, inhibited adhesion of bacteria. Another enzyme Aparaginase helped in the adhesion of GBS to vagina of the female rats. Thus PPO -plant enzyme can be used instead of antibiotics to avoid GBS infection. Immune system plays an important role in the control infectious diseases. Enhancement of immune system is another important mode of controlling the infectious disease. In this study of Amoxy cassia and C. fistula were found to be effective immunomodulator. In this study effect of Amoxy cassia, fruit solution of C. fisula amoxicillin on immune system specific hurmoral immune system of BALB/c mice employing sheep RBC as the antigen. Uncountable antibodies producing cell were formed in the spleens of the mice treated with Amoxy cassia similarly the haemagglutination titer was highest too C. fistula fruit solution also exhibited immune enhancing property. Thus novel synergistic preparation Amoxy cassia has posses dual activity antimicrobioal and immune enhancing to combat with the pathogens. Our newly formed synergistic compound-Amoxy-cassia as well as fruit extract of C fistula exhibited a very significant immunoenhancing effect in BALB/c mice. This was observed as high titer of anti-SRBC antibody as well as uncountable anti-SRBC antibody producing plasma cells in spleens of mice treated with Amoxy-cassia. Control mice treated with saline showed fewer plaques /spleen as compared to mice receiving only C. fistula or amoxicillin alone. This study shows that amoxy cassia and C. fistula to be an immuno enhancing compound. They have the potential to be an excellent drug for the patient having impaired immune system like AID patients, person suffering from malignanssies and immunocompromised host. It we look at the efficacy of the amoxy cassia, it in vitro inhibits the nosocomially acquired MRSA infection. This is the first report about the immunomodulatory properties of the C. fistula fruit extract Thus the novel synergistic formulation Amoxy-cassia is not only inhibiting the growth of difficult to treat organism including MDR Salmonella typhi strains, MRSA and, E. coli but it also enhances host immune response to specific antigens. Amoxycassia has the potential of being developed into an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of bacterial infections as well as an effective immunoenhacing substance to provide protection against infections...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar o processo de secagem do abacate cortado em fatias e de se utilizar modelos matemáticos para simular a transferência de massa durante este processo. As equações dos modelos matemáticos resultantes foram resolvidas numericamente e com o método dos mínimos quadrados foram identificados à Difusividade Efetiva e o Coeficiente Convectivo de Transferência de Massa ao longo do processo. As condições experimentais estudadas no processo de secagem levam em consideração a velocidade do ar fixada em 3 m/s e temperaturas usadas de 50, 60 e 70 ºC. O conhecimento dos coeficientes de transferência de massa é de suma importância para a secagem, sendo que o Coeficiente Convectivo de Transferência de Massa está associado às influências orgânicas e geométricas do produto e as propriedades termodinâmicas do ar. Analisando os resultados, observou-se que o aumento da temperatura favoreceu o processo de transferência de massa e com isso o aumento desses coeficientes. Observou-se também que o modelo de Fick não teve um bom ajuste aos dados experimentais, enquanto que o de Newton demonstrou ser capaz de predizer melhor a transferência de massa na superfície do produto. Os resultados obtidos foram importantes, pois permitiram o conhecimento da transferência de massa durante o processo de secagem convectiva da polpa do abacate.

In {{order to be able to}} take out oil from the <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp,</b> one must dry up the fruit first. The purpose of the present work has been to study the drying process used for sliced avocado based on mathematical models so as to simulate mass transfer during this procedure. The equations applied to the mathematical models were numerically solved, and, by using the method of the least squares, it was possible to obtain the Effective Diffusivity and the Mass Transfer Convective Coefficient. The experimental conditions studied during the drying operation required that the velocity set at 3 m/sec at temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 º C were taken into account. A thorough knowledge of the mass transfer coefficients was of paramount importance for the drying process, as the Coefficient of Convective Mass Transfer is associated to the product s organic and geometric influences as well as to the thermodynamic properties of the air. On analyzing the results, it was observed that a rise in temperature favored the process of mass transfer, increasing these coefficients. It was also noted that the Fick model did not fit the experimental data well; whereas the Newton model showed better results, being capable of predicting the mass transfer on the product surface.

In order to combine the benefits of both and to produce capsanthin-rich avocado oil using a clean extraction technology, freeze-dried avocado and red bell pepper pulps were separately packaged in a single fixed bed extractor, in which supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) was passed through the bed at 50 degrees C and 400 bar. The target compounds were simultaneously extracted from both sources, the first source containing lipids and the second source rich in capsanthin. The scCO(2) passed first through the <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> containing 68 % lipids, and then that were passed through the red bell pepper pulp contained 625 mu g/g capsanthin.

40|$|Introduction. The avocado (Persea {{americana}} Mill.) {{fruit is}} sensitive to chilling injury (CI) when exposed to low temperatures. High lipid content in <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> makes it prone to oxidation, resulting in rancidity and subsequent production of undesirable flavours and quality loss during storage. Materials and methods. Avocado fruit (cv. Becon) were treated with 1 ?L·L- 1 1 -MCP for 24 h at 20 °C, and thereafter stored at 4 °C for 21 d under low oxygen atmosphere (3. 5 % O 2), followed by transferring to 20 °C for 14 d to simulate the shelf life. The CI index, firmness, peel colour, relative electrical conductivity (EC), respiration, ethylene evolution, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, peroxidase (POD) activity, peroxide value and iodine value were measured throughout the storage period. Results and discussion. The CI incidence and severity of fruit treated {{with a combination of}} 1 -MCP and low oxygen were significantly lower and delayed compared with the other treatments. The combined application of 1 -MCP and low oxygen treatment was effective and delayed the onset of climacteric peaks of respiration and ethylene production. The delay was associated with reductions in fruit softening and cell membrane permeability as expressed by EC. The results of MDA content and POD activity of fruit treated with a combination of 1 -MCP and low oxygen were significantly reduced. Moreover, significantly lower peroxide values and higher iodine values suggested that a combination of 1 -MCP and low oxygen treatment effectively controlled the lipid oxidation in avocado fruit pulp. Conclusion. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that combined treatment (as compared with either 1 -MCP or low oxygen treatment) was the most effective for alleviation of CI, lipid oxidation stability and extending the shelf life of avocado fruit under low temperature storage (Résumé d'auteur) ...|$|E

40|$|Difficulties in {{controlling}} and forecasting avocado fruit ripening and the highly perishable {{nature of the}} crop once harvested, are the major causes of concern for avocado traders. In particular, the simultaneous presence of many suppliers may account for increased fruit variability during ripening. Avocado is a climacteric fruit with consistent ethylene production after harvest which is also related to high perishability. However, the mechanisms regulating ethylene biosynthesis and mesocarp softening are not completely understood. In order to study such effects, avocado fruit from different growing areas and harvested at various maturity stages, were investigated and the biochemical and physiological changes during ripening at both 18 and 23 °C were studied. Mesocarp softening and fatty acid content discriminated fruit maturity and growing area, respectively, whereas C 7 sugars (D-mannoheptulose and perseitol) discriminated length of fruit shelf life. For the first time, oleic acid content presents in the oil mesocarp was found to depend on fruit sources making of this a suitable indicator of avocado fruit growing area. In contrast, sugar content declined along fruit maturity and ripening. In particular the mannoheptulose presents in avocado mesocarp might be use to estimate avocado fruit shelf life. Indeed, fruit harvested late in season {{were found to have}} a lower C 7 content than earlier harvest fruit and a faster softening, regardless fruit source. However, sugars content changed between growing area, thus a general C 7 threshold defining fruit storability seems to be not definable. Furthermore, other possible indicators of fruit maturity and/or ripening stage have been searched in the cell wall constituents of avocado mesocarp. Thus, the structural carbohydrates profile of avocado mesocarp investigated with a new immunological method changed during ripening and harvest time (early and late season), suggesting a possible effect of cell wall composition on fruit ripening regulation. Also, the possible use of ethylene application in reducing the high heterogeneity noted on imported fruit from South Africa was also evaluated through different consignments. Results showed ethylene efficacy changed depending on harvest time and fruit dimension with less efficacy of the treatment on fruit harvested {{at the end of the}} season and characterised by smaller size. One of the most commercialized avocado cultivars, Hass, is peculiar in that its skin colour changes from green to deep purple as ripening progresses. The most common ripening indicator of avocado fruit is the mesocarp firmness and the destructive nature of this evaluation increases losses in the avocado industry. The availability of a non-destructive indicator of fruit ripening represents an important advantage for avocado consumers and importers. Thus, the possible relationship between mesocarp softening, skin colour were objectively evaluated (C*, L*, and H°), and the main pigment, cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside, was investigated. Cyanidin 3 -Oglucoside was confirmed to be the main anthocyanin present in avocado cv. Hass peel, regardless of preharvest factors. However, differences in its content were noted between shelf life temperatures. A higher relationship between hue angle and firmness was detected in late harvest fruit, whereas no correlation was found between anthocyanin content and firmness. Avocado skin is also involved in defence mechanisms due to the presence of antifungal and phenolic compounds. These phenolic compounds represent a natural protection against pathogenic infections and seem to be down regulated during ripening. The main phenolics were identified and quantified, using a new analytical method which was validated and optimised. Epicatechin, chlorogenic acid and procyanidin B 2 were found to be present in the skin tissue and quantified using this assay and found to vary during shelf life and seasons. Although phenolics were present in minor amounts, in <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> they are involved in mesocarp discoloration incidence, and therefore with fruit postharvest quality. Due to a lack of information, a new straightforward method for the identification and quantification of the main phenolics present in avocado mesocarp was developed. Finally, a commercial trial was undertaken to ensure that the results obtained in the laboratory can be reproduced in the market place. In conclusion, postharvest markers can define avocado fruit maturity and growing area and give guidelines in the control of avocado shelf life. Moreover, new methods for the investigation of the phenolic profiles (peel and mesocarp) and the characterisation of cell wall structures can be further tools in the management of avocado fruit postharvest quality...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter of the thesis {{entitled}} ‘Potential Use of Superheated SteamTreatment In An Underutilized Fruit of Engkala (Litsea garciae) and Evaluation of Its Antioxidant Capacity’, an introduction on the study was given where the link between antioxidants, free radicals and degenerative diseases, which is the increasingly deterioration of the function or structure of the affected body tissues or organ over time, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, gastritis, diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases were discussed. The onset of these diseases was confirmed by accumulation of free radicals that are produced from oxidation process as well as from toxic present in the environment. The damaging effects of the free radicals however can be stopped by the action of antioxidants supplied by plants when incorporated in a human diet. In the introduction, the role of polyphenols as antioxidants and their source especially from fruits were also discussed and engkala and avocado fruits, which belong in the same family were introduced as source of antioxidant in this study. Drying process of food was also discussed, emphasizing the use of freeze drying and superheated steam. In chapter 2, the characteristics of engkala fruit and its antioxidant capacity was evaluated. The physical properties, nutritional composition and minerals composition were discussed. This study showed that engkala fruit, just like avocado is a fleshy fruit where the pulp accounted for more than 50 % of the fruit weight. Nutritional compositions of engkala showed that this fruit is high in moisture, protein, carbohydrate, K, Na, Fe, Zn and Ca. Polyphenol content of engkala was determined by measuring the total phenolic and total flavonoid content. Antioxidant activities of engkala extracts were determined by using DPPH assay and ORAC assay. In DPPH assay, the concentration of the extract inhibiting 50 % of the DPPH radical activity was measured as an indicator of the antioxidant activity. In this study, the edible part of the fruit which is the pulp showed highest activity when dried with superheated-steam at the temperature of 170 °C. In ORAC assay, the oxygen radical absorbing capacity of the fruit extract was measured. The pulp of engkala also showed the same pattern, where superheated-steam dried pulp at the temperature of 170 °C gave the highest ORAC value. This study showed that superheated-steam drying gave higher polyphenol contents and antioxidant activities in engkala pulp, while freeze drying gave higher results in the seed part of the fruit. The polyphenol compound present in engkala extract was also studies by using HPLC, TG/DTA, GCMS and LC-MS system. In the third chapter, polyphenol content and antioxidant activities in avocado fruit was evaluated. The <b>avocado</b> <b>pulp</b> followed the same pattern as shown by engkala pulp, where the total phenolic, total flavonoid content as well as antioxidant activities in the pulp was significantly higher when dried with superheated-steam. The peel and seed on the other hand showed significantly higher results when freeze dried. In the fourth chapter, the antioxidant capacity of both engkala and avocado fruits were compared. The data showed that engkala pulp and seed showed higher antioxidant capacity compared to avocado. The peel on the other hand showed higher antioxidant capacity of avocado compared to engkala peel. Considering the edible part of the fruit, engkala was ranked higher than avocado where antioxidant capacity was in concern. The final chapters remark the conclusion of the whole study. It was concluded that both superheated-steam drying and freeze drying can offer their advantages in application of dried fruit production, where superheated-steam drying was preferred in drying the pulp of engkala and avocado, while freeze drying was the preferred method of drying for the seed and peel of engkala and avocado. The high potential of the by-products as given by the high antioxidant capacity especially when freeze dried suggested that they could be utilized and developed as natural antioxidants or food additives. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 237 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日 1.
