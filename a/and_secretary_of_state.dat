Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered four days earlier, but Booth believed that the American Civil War was not yet over because Confederate General Joseph E.

5|$|Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, {{unveiled}} the memorial on Sunday 26November 1922 and the Archdeacon of Rochdale gave a dedication.

He served in various public offices during the First World War, including Director General of Recruiting <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for War, before being appointed Britain's ambassador to France {{at the end of}} the war.

5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. Many of makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Corcoran. On July 23, President Abraham Lincoln <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> William Seward visited Fort Corcoran in an effort to revive morale after the defeat at Bull Run.|$|E
5|$|In early 1919, Churchill was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for War <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Air. While Churchill was preoccupied with implementing post-War defence cuts and the demobilization of the Army, the Chief of the Air Staff, Major-General Frederick Sykes, submitted a paper with what {{were at the}} time unrealistic proposals for a large air force of the future. Being dissatisfied with Sykes, Churchill began to consider reinstating Trenchard whose recent performance at Southampton had once more brought him into favour with Churchill.|$|E

He also served as Secretary of the Treasury <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> Sherman sought the Republican presidential nomination three times, coming closest in 1888, but was never chosen by the party.

5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal Secretary of State {{in many ways}} evolved from the roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, {{the power of the}} Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566â€“1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew <b>and</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{rendezvous}} with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender. Davis <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet Richard Taylor in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men {{would refuse to}} fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|After {{overseeing}} {{the transfer of}} Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at Farmville, Virginia, {{on the night of}} April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that Lee had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.|$|E

5|$|As the {{expensive}} War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentenceâ€”suspension of preaching for three yearsâ€”was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E

In her role as the ambassador's wife, Leonore directed a major renovation of the ambassador's official residence. The Annenbergs contributed to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and upon his inauguration, Leonore was named Chief of Protocol, placing her in charge of advising the president, vice president, <b>and</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> on matters relating to diplomatic protocol.|$|E

5|$|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a 2005 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning American {{historian}} Doris Kearns Goodwin, {{published by}} Simon & Schuster. The {{book is a}} biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{and some of the}} men who served with him in his cabinet from 1861 to 1865. Three of his Cabinet members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election: Attorney General Edward Bates, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P.
