40|$|Improving {{e-government}} {{services by}} using data more effectively {{is a major}} focus globally. It requires Public <b>Administrations</b> <b>to</b> be transparent, accountable and provide trustworthy services that improve citizen confidence. However, despite all the technological advantages on developing such services and analysing security and privacy concerns, the literature does not provide evidence of frameworks and platforms that enable privacy analysis, from multiple perspectives, and take into account citizens' needs with regards to transparency and usage of citizens information. This paper presents the VisiOn (Visual Privacy Management in User Centric Open Requirements) platform, an outcome of a H 2020 European Project. Our objective is <b>to</b> enable Public <b>Administrations</b> <b>to</b> analyse privacy and security from different perspectives, including requirements, threats, trust and law compliance. Finally, our platform-supported approach introduces the concept of Privacy Level Agreement (PLA) which allows Public <b>Administrations</b> <b>to</b> customise their privacy policies based on the privacy preferences of each citizen...|$|R

The model allows <b>administrations</b> <b>to</b> control their own services and users from an “Authority”. Services rely on their local authority to control access correctly, and Authorities can exchange information about users and services {{by the use of}} a controlled trust mechanism. 1...|$|R
