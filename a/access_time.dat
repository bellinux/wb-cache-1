40|$|Every {{year in the}} Rotterdam Eye Hospital, about 600 {{patients}} are operated for strabismus. They follow a long lasting process until they undergo a pos-sible surgery. This {{is due to the}} long <b>access</b> <b>times</b> at various departments of the strabismus care pathway, because demand exceeds capacity. To lower the <b>access</b> <b>times,</b> the effects of different resource allocations on the <b>access</b> <b>times</b> have to be determined. We devise a double-transition model of the logistical system of the strabismus care pathway based on Markov chains. After the simulation of this model with different variables and parameters, the results are analyzed using regressions. It appears that in general, an increase in the capacity level at a certain department decreases the <b>access</b> <b>times</b> of that department. However, the effects on the <b>access</b> <b>times</b> of other departments are not unambiguous. The eye hospital can use these results to decide which resource allocation to implement...|$|R
40|$|Most cluster tool {{scheduling}} studies assume identical <b>access</b> <b>times</b> between chambers, or do {{not discuss}} impact of the <b>access</b> <b>times</b> although the optimal scheduling rule and the cycle time can depend on the <b>access</b> <b>times</b> or physical configuration of parallel chambers. We examine cyclic scheduling problems for cluster tools that have non-identical <b>access</b> <b>times.</b> We first develop Petri net models of tool behaviors and analyze the cycle time by identifying the workloads of the process steps. We prove that the conventional backward and swap sequencing strategies are still optimal for a single-armed and a dual-armed cluster tools, respectively, when a process step is the bottleneck and the tool repeats a minimal cyclic work cycle. We also present a closed form formula for the cycle time and identify a co-prime condition {{on the number of}} parallel chambers for which the cycle time is independent of the order of using parallel chambers. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The current {{model of}} {{education}} has been suffering changes, undergoing renovations, and seeking using and enjoying increasingly technological resources, as, for example, the Learning Management System (LMS). One of the most used LMS platforms is the Modular Object Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle). This article proposes to demonstrate how Moodle platform {{was introduced in the}} subject of Stomatology through a clear and objective methodology. Study Design. In six months, 49 undergraduate students enrolled in stomatology subject accessed Moodle platform 2067 times and performed 02 evaluation exams at Discipline of Stomatology. Statistical analysis was performed by paired t-test (comparison between number of <b>access</b> <b>times</b> before the first evaluation and number of <b>access</b> <b>times</b> before the second evaluation), Wilcoxon test (student’s grade on the first and second evaluation), and Pearson correlation test (correlation between the number of <b>access</b> <b>times</b> before the first evaluation and the first grade, correlation between the number of <b>access</b> <b>times</b> before the second evaluation and the second grade, and correlation between the variation of the number of <b>access</b> <b>times</b> and the variation of the student’s grade).

25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform memory access (UMA), in which <b>access</b> <b>time</b> to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed.|$|E
25|$|They can {{potentially}} be fashioned into non-volatile solid-state memory, {{which would allow}} greater data density than hard drives with access times similar to DRAM, replacing both components. HP prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit 100 gigabits in a square centimeter, and proposed a scalable 3D design (consisting of up to 1000 layers or 1 petabit per cm3). In May 2008 HP reported that its device reaches currently about one-tenth the speed of DRAM. The devices' resistance would be read with alternating current so that the stored value would not be affected.

25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. <b>Access</b> <b>time</b> was about a quarter of a second.|$|E

Hot-spot analysis is of interest because coordinated threads of parallel programs lead to hot spots whose impact on performance may be substantial or even dominant.
