40|$|The {{purchasing}} function plays a strategic {{role in a}} company’s ability to compete. As globalization continues to increase, what becomes interesting is the effect that national culture may have on <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and, ultimately, manufacturing competitiveness. This study examines the effects of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and the <b>purchasing</b> function’s involvement with corporate strategy on manufacturing competitiveness as it is affected by national differences. In particular, {{we are interested in}} the research question: Do purchasing theories built on samples from mainly North American and Western European countries apply in other countries with different cultural contexts? The statistical results provide evidence that the engagement and efficacy of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and strategic involvement within companies vary by national culture. Moreover, a particular cultural dimension, Long-term orientation, is significantly related to the efficacy of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and strategic involvement. This finding has important implications from the perspective of purchasing decision-making in global operations. Specifically, top managers from different nations could adopt and implement similar <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities,</b> but those activities could lead to different outcomes depending on the culture. The paper concludes by reviewing research limitations and suggests further examination of operations management theories...|$|R
40|$|<b>Purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> {{are defined}} as the {{essential}} activities associated with the acquisition of the materials, services and equipment used in a business organisation. They are significant functions because they help organisations to realise many benefits such as cost reduction, improved material delivery, a shorter cycle time, access to product and process technology and quality improvement. This can only be achieved if an organisation performs its <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> effectively and efficiently. There are four purchasing development frameworks, or models, that are helpful in evaluating the <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity</b> in an organization. These are: Stannack, P. and Jones, M. (1988) Model, Reck and Long, (1988) Model, Jones, D. M., (1999) Model and Arjan V. (2000), Model. However, {{it was concluded that}} these models were nonoperational and merely indicate the stage of development of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity.</b> The shortfall of these approaches is that they have no "standard" development criteria that organizations can follow to evaluate their <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> These models also have a limited number of development measurement variables. In an attempt to overcome these shortfalls and identify factors that affect purchasing improvements, a purchasing development model was developed. The aim of this research is to produce a new purchasing maturity model (PurchMM) based {{on a wide variety of}} purchasing parameters that have been discovered during the literature review. The Readiness PurchMM describes an evolutionary improvement path for purchasing function from an ad hoc, immature process to a mature, well-organized one. Five levels of maturity encompass this path. The Readiness PurchMM guides purchasing functions that wants to gain control of their <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> for improving, developing the performance of the purchasing functions, maintainin...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demand from}} the market to carry out rapid {{business}} transactions has led many companies to seek to improve their regular business transactions. The progressive development of the internet in establishing a variety of electronic marketplaces has facilitated companies to move towards applying e-procurement technologies. This indirectly increases the competitiveness of companies due to well managed <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> using e-procurement technologies. The strategic decision by the top management in implementing e-procurement technologies is mainly concentrated on managing the supply of external resources and preferred {{to focus on the}} implementation of green supply chain activities to increase the environmental performance with e-procurement technologies. With the spread of internet technologies, which led to changes in business strategy and its uses, companies will be provided with a digital platform for online business transactions. Therefore, business through electronic media (e-media) have the potential and power to transform business transactions and business relationships. E-procurement became the most important strategy for the business to purchase or procure goods or materials from global suppliers. Despite the claims on usability of e-procurement technologies, some companies however show little interest in applying e-procurement technologies because of the difficulty the companies to perform <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and other key aspects that influence the companies to exploit the technologies. As a major contributor to the growth of the agriculture sector, the Malaysia Palm Oil Industry (MPOI) should explore the potential of e-procurement and other relevant technologies to be exploited in the industry and enhance its competitiveness. The information on the applicability of e-procurement technologies for different types of materials at different stages of the industry supply chain will assist the industry players to achieve efficient <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> Hence, in this chapter the case study discussed will provide relevant e-procurement solutions with respect to the MPOI and will provide comprehensive <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> of different types of products along the supply chain through e-procurement technologies...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{claim that}} the <b>purchase</b> <b>activities</b> can be {{triggered}} {{by a set of}} hidden events and the player information should be organized into multi-instance bags. In multi-instance representation, we treat each event record, like “ID: 187759, Player ID: 16749, Time 11 : 20 p.m., Date 12 - 04 - 2014, Location coordinate (12, 14), Type attack, etc”, as an instance, and all instances from one player are in one bag. For facilitating the description, an illustration is shown in Fig.  2. As shown in Fig.  2, each player is represented as a bag which contains large number of instances. Each instance in a bag describes an event, either hidden event or user <b>purchase</b> <b>activity.</b> The events are with feature ID, Player ID, Timestamp, etc. An example of the complicated dependency and long-distance intervention is also shown in Fig.  2, which is marked with red right-arrows. The example indicates that the <b>purchase</b> <b>activity</b> of prop p is related to two hidden events i and j which occur with different timestamp. It is obvious that we can treat the props which were (or would be potentially) bought as the labels. One player could buy more than one prop to improve the game characters abilities; therefore, one bag can map to multiple labels, i.e., Fig.  2 essentially offers a multi-instance multi-label representation. Then, the game props recommendation task can be cast into an MIML prediction problem.|$|R
30|$|It {{is notable}} that the {{mentioned}} event {{is not directly}} related to the <b>purchase</b> <b>activity,</b> and is, therefore, denoted as a hidden event.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problems and}} challenges that arise if a firm tries to concentrate <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in a separate organisational unit. For a variety of reasons, only a – small – part of all <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in an organisation is actually carried out by a purchasing department or a specialist. In particular, the purchasing of so-called non-product-related (NPR) items and services often takes place without the involvement of a purchasing department. In addition, despite the sometimes huge savings that reportedly are possible by involving a purchasing department, many managers and boards pay only modest attention to such opportunities. In this paper, a conceptual model is proposed that serves, in particular, to explain the Purchasing department’s limited and problematic involvement in a firm’s tactical NPR-purchasing activities. Based on these explanations and results from a small empirical study, we draw conclusions and formulate implications for managers and purchasing specialists. Research implications are formulated as well. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that in a business-to-business market an international vendor may adopt a global account management program whereby a global account manager coordinates the activities serving an international customer. This conceptual study sheds more light on international account management, thereby using the term international account manager which can refer to a global account manager or a regional account manager. An important managerial problem is the question across how many countries an international vendor should coordinate its sales activities. In the literature several scholars have taken a contingency perspective and have argued that, in order to maximise the performance of the international vendor, the number of countries across which the international vendor’s sales activities are coordinated should be adapted to the number of countries across which the international customer coordinates its <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> These scholars adopted a ‘symmetric fit’ perspective whereby the term fit is interpreted as an equality. In other words, they stated that the number of countries across which the sales activities are coordinated should be equal to the number of countries across which the international customer coordinates its <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> In contrast, this conceptual study will take an ‘asymmetric fit’ perspective whereby the term fit is interpreted as an inequality. A framework will be proposed that shows how an international vendor can increase its performance by coordinating its sales activities to a greater degree than the degree of cross-border coordination of the international customer’s <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> Remarkably, this conceptual study suggests a new type of internationalisation driver.

40|$|Purpose - The thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{framework}} of measuring the performance of pur-chasing consortia humanitarian sector. The performance measurement seeks to identify the competitive advantages of {{being a member of}} purchasing consortia during <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> of transportation ervices. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a qualitative study with de-ductive and explanatory approach. Semi-structured interviews with experts within the humanitarian sector have been conducted to gain necessary and credible data. Findings – It has been identified that purchasing consortia do not mutually operate physical <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> However, the consortia performance measurement framework, derived from the resource-based view, illustrates that being a member gen-erates the capabilities of decreased purchasing complexity, learning capabilities and ca-pacity sharing. These capabilities {{have a significant impact on}} the purchasing process for transportation services and lead to the competitive advantages of (1) having access to extensive knowledge, (2) reducing operational efforts, (3) reducing lead-time and (4) improving learning procedures. Research limitations/implications – As the literature on humanitarian logistics is still in its infancy, further applications from the commercial sector were considered to strengthen the results of the framework. Practical implications - The extent of collaboration of purchasing consortia indicates that managers of HOs are able to gain significant expertise and offers advantageous opportunities in handling <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in humanitarian logistics. The implications cover strategic as well as operational issues. Originality/value – The thesis gives an insight about practical purchasing operations of existing consortia and detects previously unknown aspects within the literature of humanitarian logistics...|$|R
