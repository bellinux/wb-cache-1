5|$|A town borough was {{formally}} created in 1201, {{and by the}} 1220s there was a settlement established outside the castle gates; some of those residents who had been {{moved out of the}} bailey may have resettled there. Richard built <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> around the new town, linking it to the castle defences, intending it both as a defensive measure and to impress visitors.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), {{veterans}} re-enacted Pickett's Charge in {{a spirit}} of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E

In 1823 a group of elm trees were planted {{near the top of the}} mound.|$|E

5|$|George Hunt leased {{the castle}} in 1841 {{and it was}} turned into a private house under the {{supervision}} of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building. George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> around the front of property.|$|E

5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{built by}} Bishop Gundulf {{in the late}} 12thcentury was {{enclosed}} by <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> Situated in the south-west corner of the city, the castle used {{the remains of the}} Roman town walls as foundations. The circuit had at least one tower; it was replaced in the 14thcentury. The original gateway was radically altered in the 13th or 14thcentury. From across the River Medway, the twin landmarks of Rochester's castle and cathedral would have dominated the medieval landscape, symbolic of the authority of the church and nobility in the period. Most castles were built by secular nobles, but the work by Gundulf and his successor Corbeil provide examples {{of the role of the}} church in castle building.|$|E

5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of the fifth sultan of Bolkiah between 1485 and 1524, the Sultanate's thalassocracy {{extended}} over northern Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, as far as Kota Seludong (present-day Manila) with its influence extending as far of Banjarmasin, taking advantage of maritime trade after the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese. Many Brunei Malays migrated to Sabah during this period, beginning after the Brunei conquest of the territory in the 15th century. But plagued by internal strife, civil war, piracy and the arrival of western powers, the Bruneian Empire began to shrink. The first Europeans to visit Brunei were the Portuguese, who described the capital of Brunei at the time as surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> The Spanish followed, arriving soon after Ferdinand Magellan's death in 1521, when the remaining members of his expedition sailed to the islands of Balambangan and Banggi in the northern tip Borneo; later, in Castilian War of 1578, Spain unsuccessfully declared war on Brunei. The Sulu region gained its own independence in 1578, forming their own sultanate known as the Sultanate of Sulu.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet {{to take the time}} to dig in {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a kill zone over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> at the foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E
