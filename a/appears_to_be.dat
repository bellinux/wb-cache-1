50|$|The youth's {{errors are}} blamed on his age, {{but others say}} young gentlemen should enjoy themselves.

The follies of the youth <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> truths that some may want to erroneously emulate, like wolves who <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lambs and lead the lambs astray. The youth could do the same, but should not do so, because the poet's disapproval of such behavior undermines his good report of the youth, and such behaviour will also reflect badly on the poet.|$|R

50|$|Small {{amounts of}} regular ice <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> white because of air bubbles inside them {{and also because}} small {{quantities}} of water <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> colourless.

Large quantities of water <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. Therefore, a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, would appear blue.|$|R
5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.

5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions.
