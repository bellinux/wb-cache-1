5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} a {{location}} {{is affected by}} its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it.

5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, {{is often}} called the vestibulocerebellum.

Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović was {{inspired}} to create the painting upon reading a book titled History of the Serb People while studying at the Munich Academy. The painting was poorly received by Belgrade's art critics. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson suggests {{this was due to}} its poor compositional <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> conception. By the 1870s, Ivanović's works had largely been forgotten in Serbia. The Conquest of Belgrade was one of four paintings offered by Ivanović to the Gallery of Historical Portraits in 1874. The Gallery went on to form the nucleus of what was to become the National Museum of Serbia. The painting is currently in the possession of the National Museum.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E

However, {{existing}} <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> temporal database systems cannot fully manage time-varying data with both <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> non-spatial attributes. To overcome this limitation, {{we present a}} framework for spatio-temporal databases that can manage all time-varying historical information <b>and</b> integrate <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> temporal relationship operators into the select statement in SQL 3. For the purpose of our framework, we define three referencing macros and a history aggregate operator and classify the existing <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> temporal relationship operators into three groups: exclusively spatial relationship operators, exclusively temporal relationship operators, and spatio-temporal common relationship operators. Finally, we believe the integration of <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> temporal relationship operators into SQL 3 will provide a useful framework for the history management of time-varying spatial objects in a uniform manner...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{planning}} of logistics centres follows specific <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> infrastructural requirements, conditioned by desired traffic flux <b>and</b> scope. <b>Spatial</b> <b>and</b> environmental {{limitations of the}} usual freight handling sites are forcing logistical activities to search for areas that can ensure undisturbed expansion and practically unlimited traffic flows. The consequence of this trend is suburbanisation coupled with all the <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> environmental effects. Within this framework, set against the awareness of the uniqueness of any particular site, the article points out the significance of a comprehensive <b>and</b> timely <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> environmental {{planning of}} logistical centres. Therefore clear spatial objectives, transparent analytical starting blocks and adequate planning regulation {{prove to be the}} imperative in the spatial planning of logistical centres and formulation of the <b>spatial</b> concept.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} the {{knowledge-based}} system rosa working on <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> functional organizations in agriculture.

The {{goal of the}} system is twofold: formalizing and building a case base holding on farm <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> functional organizations, and helping the analysis of new cases. Domain knowledge and cases are modeled {{with the help of the}} so-called spatial organization graphs (sogs), and represented within a description logic system. Hierarchical casebased reasoning, involving classification <b>and</b> qualitative <b>spatial</b> reasoning, is used to compare <b>and</b> explain farm <b>spatial</b> structures modeled by sogs. An example of case retrieval is proposed, followed by a global discussion on case-based reasoning in the rosa system and related work...|$|R
