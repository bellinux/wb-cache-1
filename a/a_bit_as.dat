25|$|Leaving {{downtown}} Moscow, PA435 continues northward {{aside the}} Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad line. The forestry soon takes over and residences become sporadic as the route winds {{its way through}} Elmhurst Township. The rail line moves to the east <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> both the railroad and PA435 pass the Elmhurst Reservoir. Passing Fairview Memorial Park, Blue Shutters Road (State Route2010) soon merges in. After the reservoir ends, PA435 crosses under the curving rail line and continues northward into the hamlet of Elmhurst. Through Elmhurst, PA435 begins a parallel with PA590, which soon merges in with the main route. PA435 widens to a four-lane divided highway and continues northwestward out of Elmhurst, crossing over I-84. After this bridge, PA348 merges into the highway. PA348 ends at southbound PA435 while northbound PA435 passes over PA348 with a ramp connection to the route. The highway winds along the Roaring Brook into Dunmore, following the Drinker Turnpike until it forks. PA435 soon turns to the northwest once again and merges into Exit 2 on the concurrent I-84 and I-380 in Dunmore.|$|E

Cordell said that pop culture has [...] "less impact on [...] conceptualizations of the undead", but he did mention The Evil Dead, 28 Days Later and the novel Salem's Lot. According to Collins, he and Cordell worked equally on the book, with Collins focusing more on material relating to character building, sample undead and running undead, while Cordell dealt with monster design and undead material, {{but he said that}} they [...] "dabbled in each others'" [...] sections quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> well".

Jeremy Thompson of Roller Coaster Philosophy gave a similar review, enjoying the ride and ranking it number 15 on his top-coasters list; however, he criticized the lack of elements during the ride's second half. Arthur Levine of About.com expanded on Thompson's criticism, calling the ride one of North America's top-10 overrated roller coasters. Levine described it as an [...] "impressive-looking coaster" [...] which [...] "has almost no airtime, shudders <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> it delivers a few head-banging moments, and is largely nondescript". In Mitch Hawker's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll, the Time Machine peaked at number 102 in its debut year (2008). In 2009, it dropped to 138th out of 368 ranked steel roller coasters.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it {{said the}} episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and that Jenna Fischer was [...] "fantastic", {{but he felt}} the episode was less {{outright}} funny than recent episodes. But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner. It feels {{a bit like the}} episode is marking time – which is exactly what Michael is doing with his final two weeks on the job."

500|$|In contrast, The Wires Esther Zuckerman {{criticized the}} {{inclusion}} of a romantic relationship in the film, and said of the two characters' kiss: [...] "There's a case to be made that the kiss is simply an acceptance of their fate, but everything we know about Rita up until this point implies that she's a dedicated soldier, and making her a sudden romantic betrays her character." [...] Zuckerman added: [...] "That's not to say she can't soften up <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> humans do, but the moment reads less like she's accepting her humanity and more like the filmmakers had to acknowledge two attractive leads ... who should lock lips because that's what men and women do in movies." [...] Writing in The Week, Monika Bartyzel also criticized the romance in the film, stating that Rita is the one who kisses Cage, despite knowing him for only a day where he had known her for multiple days via time loop. Bartyzel said that Rita's portrayal was part of a commonly seen motif in which a female character helps a male [...] "Chosen One" [...] character, and that this was [...] "the new normal because it allows Hollywood to appeal to feminist concerns while continuing to feed male wish fulfillment". Bartyzel said that Rita [...] "at her most powerful" [...] ultimately serves [...] "to make the male hero into a fighter like herself".|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> a person and I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about {{the inspiration for the}} song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|... "The Big Big Beat" [...] {{is a house}} song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-four seconds, and contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice. Before {{the release of the}} song, Banks described the single as giving [...] "Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense that both contain [...] "fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor-ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track [...] "fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed-up digi-hi-hat beat", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as [...] "maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing [...] "'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing the swing of programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party really gets started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, then things smooth out just <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> AB flexes her vocals on the chorus". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as [...] "glittery synthesizers", alluding that Banks had returned [...] "swinging and vogueing" [...] on the song.|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

Before returning to Kus, Allen co-wrote the songs for the album with Kurstin who played piano on it. This is a change from her earlier work in which she wrote lyrics for finished tracks. Allen released a statement saying [...] "We decided to try and make bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs ... I wanted to work with one person from start to finish to make it one body of work. I wanted it to feel like it had some sort of integrity.

2500|$|After Lord Clive {{finished}} {{working up}} {{she was sent}} to the Thames Estuary on 9 August 1915 to practice bombardment techniques with her sisters [...] and [...] A replica had been laid out there of some of the principal features of the Belgian coast near Zeebrugge and the ships practised their manoeuvering and spotting arrangements. Two tripods were dropped in the sea, housing observers which could triangulate the fall of shot and signal corrections to the monitors. One problem was that the modified 12-inch gun mounts broke down quite <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>as</b> they had not been designed to fire at angles up to 30° and many of their components were quite elderly. The ships were judged ready and a bombardment was planned on 21 August. This had to be postponed for a day because of bad weather, but Lord Clive, her sisters and their supporting armada of ten destroyers, nine minesweepers, the seaplane carrier , four ships to handle the observation tripods, and no less than fifty drifters to handle the explosive anti-submarine nets laid to protect the monitors, sailed to a position about [...] off Zeebrugge during the night of 22–23 August. Lord Clive anchored and opened fire at 05:36 on the locks of the Zeebrugge Canal that led to the German naval base at Bruges. She fired 31 shells at the locks over {{an hour and a half}} before switching targets to a nearby factory which received eleven rounds. Vice Admiral Reginald Bacon ordered the ships to cease-fire after two hours, cancelling the plans to bombard Ostend as well since both Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been suffering significant problems with their turrets. The bombardment was fairly ineffectual; two barges were sunk, some buildings damaged, two civilians killed and some German workmen injured, but the locks were not hit. The British judged this a good first try and planned for a bombardment of Ostend once Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been repaired.|$|E
2500|$|Mulford was a {{prolific}} story teller {{in addition to}} his other talents. [...] He lectured on garden and natural history subjects to colleges, universities, schools and garden clubs throughout the United States as well as in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Canada. [...] He wrote quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> well. His earliest writings {{came in the form of}} letters which were abundant even at an early age. Some were simple postcards, acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a road map to his outward activities. His letters were often either quite humorous or poetic prose although he also wrote poetry which he would use occasionally to adorn Christmas cards and the like. In the later years, after his move to Florida it was typical that you could find them scribbled on his Tropical Arts letterhead paper. Beginning in the 1940s Mulford along with Racine began publishing their ever-expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications. These ranged from well-known venues such as The Smithsonian, The New York Times, and House Beautiful to trade journals such as the National Horticultural Magazine and Cactus and Succulent Journal to name just a few. A special article called [...] "Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor" [...] was published in the October 1950 National Geographic Magazine along with color photos. It was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to South America including Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook and Air Gardens of Brazil Mulford also became the founder and President of the Bromeliad Society in 1950 through 1959 and became its editor from 1951 through 1958 [...] and with his editorship of the Bulletin his audience became worldwide. He wrote numerous pieces for the Bromeliad Journal International which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today. He maintained this responsibility for over a decade with Racine acting a copy editor for years.
